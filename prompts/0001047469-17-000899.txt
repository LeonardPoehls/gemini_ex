ITEM 1. Business

Overview
--------


Cigna Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (either individually or collectively referred to as "Cigna," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us") is a global health services organization dedicated to a mission of helping individuals improve their health, well-being and sense of security. To execute on our mission, Cigna's strategy is to "Go Deep", "Go Global" and "Go Individual" with a differentiated set of medical, dental, disability, life and accident insurance and related products and services offered by our subsidiaries. 
 
In an increasingly retail-oriented marketplace, we focus on delivering affordable and personalized products and services to customers through employer-based, government sponsored and individual coverage arrangements. We increasingly collaborate with health care providers to continue the transition from volume-based fee for service arrangements toward a more value-based system designed to increase quality of care, lower costs and improve health outcomes. We operate a customer-centric organization enabled by keen insights regarding customer needs, localized decision-making and  talented professionals committed to bringing our "Together All the Way" brand promise to life. 
 In particular, over the past several years, to achieve the goals of better health, affordability, localization and an improved experience for the customer, we have continued expanding our participation in collaborative care and other delivery arrangements with health care professionals across the care delivery spectrum, including large and small physician groups, specialist groups and hospitals. More recently, we have developed innovative tools and flexible provider arrangements that provide a truly personalized customer experience. These arrangements and tools are discussed in more detail in the "Global Health Care" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") beginning on page 3. 
 We present the financial results of our businesses in the following three reportable segments: 
 Global Health Care aggregates the Commercial and Government operating segments. 
  
The Commercial operating segment encompasses both the U.S. commercial and certain international health care businesses serving employers and their employees, other groups, and individuals. In this segment, we refer to employer or other groups as the "client" and the individual as the "customer." Products and services include medical, dental, behavioral health, vision, and prescription drug benefit plans, health advocacy programs and other products and services to insured and self-insured customers.

  
The Government operating segment offers Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans to seniors and Medicaid plans. 

 Global Supplemental Benefits offers supplemental health, life and accident insurance products in selected international markets and in the U.S.

We present the remainder of our segment results in Other Operations, consisting of the corporate-owned life insurance business ("COLI"), run-off reinsurance and settlement annuity businesses and deferred gains associated with the sales of the individual life insurance and annuity and retirement benefits businesses. 
 Our revenues are derived principally from premiums on insured products, fees from self-insured products and services, mail-order pharmacy sales and investment income. 
 
  
Proposed Merger with Anthem, Inc. ("Anthem")
--------------------------------------------


On July 23, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to engage in a series of transactions to merge Cigna with Anthem, subject to certain terms, conditions and customary operating covenants, with Anthem continuing as the surviving company. At special shareholders' meetings in December 2015, Cigna shareholders approved the merger with Anthem and Anthem shareholders voted to approve the issuance of shares of Anthem common stock according to the merger agreement. Upon closing, our shareholders would receive $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 of a share of Anthem common stock for each common share of the Company. 
 Consummation of the merger is subject to certain customary conditions, including the receipt of certain necessary governmental and regulatory approvals, and the absence of a legal restraint prohibiting the consummation of the merger. On July 21, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and certain state attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the "District Court") seeking to block the merger and, on January 4, 2017, the parties concluded the District Court trial. On February 8, 2017, the District Court issued an order enjoining the proposed merger. Anthem appealed this ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the "Appeals Court"). Cigna appealed following the Chancery Court decision described below, and oral arguments for the appeal are scheduled for March 24, 2017. 
 On February 14, 2017, Cigna delivered a notice to Anthem terminating the merger agreement and filed suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the "Chancery Court") seeking, among other things, declaratory judgment that Cigna's termination of the merger agreement is lawful and that Anthem does not have the right to extend the merger agreement termination date. Later that day, Anthem filed a lawsuit in the Chancery Court against us seeking, among other things, a temporary restraining order to enjoin Cigna from terminating the merger agreement, specific performance and damages, and, on February 15, 2017, the Chancery Court issued an order temporarily enjoining the Company from terminating the merger agreement. This order will be subject to further review at a preliminary injunction hearing. 
 See Notes 3 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information about the proposed merger. See Item 1A. - Risk Factors in this Form 10-K for risks to our business due to the proposed merger.

The Health Care Reform Act
--------------------------


The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to throughout this Form 10-K as the "Health Care Reform Act," "ACA" or "PPACA") continues to have a significant impact on our business operations. With the outcome of the U.S. elections in 2016, and the advent of the Trump Administration in January 2017, the future of the Health Care Reform Act is uncertain. The effects of the Health Care Reform Act are discussed throughout this Form 10-K where appropriate, including in the Global Health Care business description, Regulation, Risk Factors, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A"), and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We seek to differentiate ourselves in this business by providing innovative personalized and affordable health care solutions to our clients and customers. As a leader in the drive to transition the health care delivery system from volume-based reimbursements to a value orientation, our strategy is to accelerate our engagement with employers and individuals in order to: 1) increase our customers' involvement in their health care and 2) develop deep insights into customer needs. Our differentiated approach also targets selected geographies and market segments and, within those local markets, stronger relationships with health care providers that promote quality and affordability of care for our customers and clients. 
 Innovation is core to the way we do business. We seek new and innovative solutions through technology and physician engagement to drive efficiencies, as well as bring differentiated value to our customers. Product development in the following areas reflects our innovative approach: our industry-leading CDHP (consumer-directed health plan) offerings; the recently introduced Cigna One Guide® program that combines a state-of-the-art digital experience with a human concierge service; and the Cigna SureFit® network that allows individual family members to choose their personal care networks, consistent with their health needs and provider preferences.

 PART I ITEM 1. Business
 Our Commercial operating segment encompasses both our U.S. commercial and certain international health care businesses serving employers and their employees, including globally-mobile individuals, and other groups (e.g., governmental and non-governmental organizations, unions and associations). In addition, our U.S. commercial health care business also serves individuals through our product offerings both on and off the public health insurance exchanges. 

Principal Products and Services
-------------------------------

Commercial Medical Health Plans  U.S. and International 
 The Commercial operating segment, either directly or through its partners, offers some or all of its products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Australia. We offer a variety of medical plans including:
  
 Managed Care Plans including HMO, Network, Network Open Access and Open Access Plus.  We offer health care services through insured and self-insured indemnity managed care benefit plans and Health Maintenance Organizations ("HMOs") that use meaningful cost-sharing incentives to encourage the use of "in-network" versus "out-of-network" health care providers and provide the option to select a primary care physician. The national provider network for Managed Care Plans is somewhat smaller than the national network used with the preferred provider ("PPO") plan product line. If a particular plan covers non-emergency services received from a non-participating health care provider, the customer's cost-sharing obligation is usually greater for the out-of-network care. 

 PPO Plans.  Our PPO product line features a network with broader provider access than the Managed Care Plans. The preferred provider product line may be at a higher cost than our Managed Care Plans. 

 Choice Fund® Suite of Consumer-Driven Products.  Our medical plans are often integrated with the Cigna Choice Fund suite of products: Health Reimbursement Accounts ("HRA"), Health Savings Accounts ("HSA") and Flexible Spending Accounts ("FSA"). These Choice Fund products are designed to encourage customers to play an active role in understanding and managing their health and associated expenses. Customers can use these tax-advantaged accounts to finance eligible health care expenses and other approved services. In most cases, these products are combined with a high deductible medical plan. Over three million customers have chosen Choice Fund product solutions. 

Cigna Connect is an individual plan offered in markets within eight states. The product is comprised of a network of health care providers in local areas who have been selected with cost and quality in mind. Customers who participate in the Connect network will receive care at Cigna's lower negotiated rates to help keep out-of-pocket costs down. Out-of-network coverage is not available except for urgent and emergent care. 

Cigna Focus is an individual plan offered in one market. The product is comprised of a network of health care providers in the local area where members have direct access to providers, where no referrals or PCP selection is required. Out-of-network coverage is not available except for urgent and emergent care. 

 Approximately 90% of our commercial medical customers are enrolled in medical plans with either Administrative Services Only or Experience-Rated funding arrangements that allow the corporate client to directly benefit from lower medical costs. 
 
​ 4 CIGNA CORPORATION - 2016 Form 10-K | ​ | ​
------------------------------------------+---+--

PART I ITEM 1. Business 
 The funding arrangements available for our commercial medical and dental health plans are as follows: 

   
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | | Funding Arrangements and Descriptions: Commercial | | ​ 
 | | | | Administrative Services Only  Plan sponsors self-fund all claims, but may purchase stop loss insurance to limit exposure.  We collect fees from plan sponsors for providing access to our participating provider network and for other services and programs including: claims administration; behavioral health; disease management; utilization management; cost containment; dental; and pharmacy benefit management.  In some cases, we provide performance guarantees that provide potential fee refunds if certain service standards, clinical outcomes or financial metrics are not met. | | 
 | | Insured  Experience Rated ("Shared Returns")  Premium charged during a policy period ("initial premium") may be adjusted following the policy period for actual claim and, in some cases, administrative cost experience of the policyholder:  When claims and expenses are less than the initial premium charged (an "experience surplus"), the policyholder may be credited for a portion of this premium.  However, if claims and expenses exceed the initial premium (an "experience deficit"), we bear these costs. In certain cases, experience deficits may be recovered through experience surpluses in a future year if the policyholder renews. | | 
 | | Insured  Guaranteed Cost  We establish the cost to the policyholder at the beginning of a policy period and generally cannot subsequently adjust premiums to reflect actual claim experience until the next annual renewal.  Employers and other groups with guaranteed cost policies are generally smaller than those with experience-rated group policies. Accordingly, our claim and expense assumptions may be based in whole or in part on prior experience of the policyholder or on a pool of similar policyholders.  HMO and individual plans (medical and dental) are offered on a guaranteed cost basis only. Individual and "small employer" (employers with 50 or fewer employees) plans are required to be community-rated under federal law. | | 
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​


In most states, individual and group insurance premium rates must be approved by the applicable state regulatory agency (typically department of insurance) and state or federal laws may restrict or limit the use of rating methods. Premium rates for groups and individuals are subject to state review for reasonableness. In addition, the Health Care Reform Act subjects individual and small group policy rate increases above an identified threshold to review by the United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") and requires payment of premium refunds on individual and group medical insurance products if minimum medical loss ratio ("MLR") requirements are not met. In our individual business, premiums may also be adjusted as a result of the government risk mitigation programs. The MLR represents the percentage of premiums used to pay medical claims and expenses for activities that improve the quality of care. See the "Regulation" section of this Form 10-K for additional information on the commercial MLR requirements and the risk mitigation programs of the Health Care Reform Act. 
   Government Health Plans 
   Medicare Advantage 
 We offer Medicare Advantage plans in 17 states and the District of Columbia through our Cigna-HealthSpring brand. Under such a plan, Medicare-eligible beneficiaries may receive health care benefits, including prescription drugs, through a managed care health plan such as our coordinated care plans. A significant portion of our Medicare Advantage customers receive medical care from our innovative plan models that focus on developing highly engaged physician networks, aligning payment incentives to improved health outcomes, and using timely and transparent data sharing. We are focused on continuing to expand these models in the future. 
 We receive revenue from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") for each plan customer based on customer demographic data and actual customer health risk factors compared to the broader Medicare population. We also may earn additional revenue from CMS related to quality performance measures (known as "Star Ratings"). The Medicare Stars payment equals 5% per member risk-adjusted revenue added to the CMS payment for each contract that achieves four stars or higher. See the "Executive Overview" section of our MD&A beginning on page 36 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of our Star ratings. Additional premiums may be received from customers, representing the difference between CMS subsidy payments and the revenue determined as part of our annual Medicare Advantage bid submissions. The Health Care Reform Act requires Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans to meet a minimum MLR of 85%. If the MLR for a CMS contract

--+---+------------------------------------------

  Back to Contents
 PART I ITEM 1. Business
 is less than 85%, we are required to pay a rebate to CMS and could be required to make additional payments if the MLR continues to be less than 85% for successive years. 
 Medicare Part D 
 Our Medicare Part D prescription drug program provides a number of plan options, as well as service and information support, to Medicare and Medicaid eligible customers. Our plans are available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and offer the savings of Medicare combined with the flexibility to provide enhanced benefits and a drug list tailored to individuals' specific needs. Eligible beneficiaries benefit from broad network access and value-added services intended to help keep them well and save them money. 
 Medicaid 
 We offer Medicaid coverage to low income individuals in selected markets in Texas and Illinois. Our Medicaid customers benefit from many of the coordinated care aspects of our Medicare Advantage programs. 
 We receive revenue from the states of Texas and Illinois for our Medicaid only customers. For customers eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid ("dual eligibles") we receive revenue from both the state and CMS. All revenue is based on customer demographic data and actual customer health risk factors. Similar to Medicare Advantage, there are minimum MLR requirements in Illinois (85% for the dual product and 88% for the Medicaid only product). However, Texas utilizes an experience rebate in an effort to provide better value to consumers and increase transparency. The Texas experience rebate takes into account operating expenses and requires a rebate of dollars to the state as different profitability thresholds are met. 
   Specialty Products and Services 
 Our specialty products and services described below are designed to improve the quality of care, lower the cost and help customers achieve better health outcomes. Many of these products can be sold on a standalone basis, but we believe they are most effective when integrated with a Cigna-administered health plan. Our specialty products are focused in the areas of medical, behavioral, pharmacy management, dental and vision. 
 Medical Specialty 
  
 Stop Loss.  We offer stop loss insurance coverage for self-insured plans that provides reimbursement for claims in excess of a predetermined amount for individuals ("specific"), the entire group ("aggregate"), or both. 

 Cost-Containment Service.  We administer cost-containment programs on behalf of our clients and customers for health care services and supplies that are covered under health benefit plans. These programs may involve vendors who perform activities designed to control health costs by reducing out-of-network utilization and costs, including educating customers regarding the availability of lower cost, in-network services, negotiating discounts, reviewing provider bills, and recovering overpayments from other payers or health care providers. We charge fees for providing or arranging for these services.

 Consumer Health Engagement.  We offer a wide array of medical management, disease management, and wellness services to employers and other plan sponsors to help individuals improve their health, well-being and sense of security. These services are offered to customers covered under plans that we administer, as well as plans insured or administered by competing insurers or third-party administrators. Our Medical Management programs include case management, specialty case management and utilization management including a 24-hour nurse information line. Our Health Advocacy programs and services include early intervention in the treatment of chronic conditions (such as Asthma, Diabetes, etc.). We also offer a combination of online tools and education programs to help customers manage their health and an array of health and wellness coaching to address lifestyle management issues (such as stress, weight, and tobacco cessation) and other conditions (such as Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Pre-Diabetes, etc.). We also administer incentives to motivate customers to engage in and improve their health. 

   Pharmacy Management 
 We offer prescription drug plans to our commercial and government customers both in conjunction with our medical products and on a stand-alone basis. With a network of over 68,000 pharmacies, Cigna Pharmacy Management is a comprehensive pharmacy benefits manager ("PBM") offering clinical programs and specialty pharmacy solutions. We also offer high quality, efficient, and cost-effective mail order, telephone and on-line pharmaceutical fulfillment services through our home delivery operation. 
 Our medical and pharmacy coverage can meet the needs of customers with complex medical conditions requiring specialty pharmaceuticals. These types of medications are covered under both pharmacy and medical benefits and can be expensive, often requiring associated lab work and administration by a health care professional. Therefore, coordination is critical in improving affordability and outcomes. Clients with Cigna-administered medical and pharmacy coverage may benefit from continuity of care, integrated reporting, and meaningful unit cost discounts on specialty drugs. 
   Behavioral Health 
 We arrange for behavioral health care services for customers through our network of approximately 108,700 participating behavioral health care professionals and 13,900 facilities and clinics. We offer behavioral health care case management services, employee assistance programs ("EAP"), and work/life programs to employers, government entities and other groups sponsoring health benefit plans. We focus on integrating our programs and services with medical, pharmacy and disability programs to facilitate customized, holistic care.

   Dental 
 We offer a variety of insured and self-insured dental care products including dental health maintenance organization plans ("Dental HMO") in 36 states, dental preferred provider organization ("Dental PPO") plans in 49 states and the District of Columbia, exclusive dental provider organization plans, traditional dental indemnity plans and a dental discount program. Employers and other groups can purchase our products as stand-alone products or integrated with medical products. Additionally, individual customers can purchase Dental PPO plans in conjunction with individual medical policies. 
 Cigna has partnered with a healthcare technology company, to launch an online consumer engagement tool for Dental PPO customers in 2016. This enhancement allows Cigna Dental PPO customers to schedule appointments online, compare out-of-pocket costs across multiple dentists, and access information that evaluates the dentist's professional history, affordability, and service quality. 
 As of December 31, 2016, our dental customers totaled 15 million worldwide and approximately 65% are enrolled in plans with funding arrangements that allow the corporate client to directly benefit from lower dental costs. Our U.S. customers access care from one of the largest Dental PPO networks and Dental HMO networks, with approximately 142,700 Dental PPO and 19,800 Dental HMO health care professionals. 
   Vision 
 Cigna Vision offers flexible, cost-effective PPO coverage that includes a range of both in and out-of-network benefits for routine vision services offered in conjunction with our medical and dental product offerings. Our national vision care network, consisting of approximately 84,000 health care providers in over 26,200 locations, includes private practice ophthalmologist and optometrist offices, as well as retail eye care centers. 

Service and Quality
-------------------

  Customer Service 
 For U.S.-based customers, we operate 17 service centers that together in 2016 processed approximately 163 million medical claims and handled 32.5 million calls providing our customers service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. 
 In our international health care business, we have a service model dedicated to the unique needs of our 1.5 million customers around the world. We service them from nine globally deployed service centers that are also available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. 
   Technology 
 Cigna Technology supports the Go Deep, Go Global, Go Individual strategy by focusing on strong foundational services, executing on an aligned business portfolio and targeting innovation and digital enhancements in key differentiating areas. Paramount to our global information technology strategy is supporting the imperatives of affordability, personalization and localization. Our goal is a continued focus on targeted technology investments to enable our strategic business objectives. This is accomplished by delivering innovative technology that enables more efficient operations, improves process integrity, builds stronger relationships with our key stakeholders; optimizes our economies of scale; and maximizes delivery of flexible payment arrangements, innovative products and services and intelligent analytics to support evidence-based medicine. Through continued execution of these capabilities, we are able to better and more rapidly deliver market-differentiating and innovative solutions. 
 Our approach to innovation is based on three major pillars: 1) organic development that creates new capabilities through internal research and development; 2) venture partnerships/early-stage investments where we are working with other external stakeholders; and 3) client-centric prototyping that develops solutions directly with clients to address specific needs. This approach to innovation has fueled our ability to rapidly innovate and bring to market solutions that differentiate us from competitors. This has resulted in an increased number of solutions that improve affordability, increase patient access and optimize the consumer experience. Examples include capabilities such as Cigna Virtual Health, first launched in the United Kingdom as the first totally digital virtual care team to Cigna One Guide® that simplifies and streamlines the entire customer experience in a highly personalized manner. Cigna has launched a growing portfolio that leverages emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence based predictive analytics, augmented reality and virtual reality, social experiences and gamification. Innovation is core to the way we do business and we continuously seek opportunities to drive efficiencies and create a superior customer experience through technology. 
 Data Analytics 
 Cigna has transformed substantial investments in analytics talent, data infrastructure, and machine learning capabilities over the past several years into a closed loop, self-learning insights system that guides our decision making and executing on our strategy. Our Insights That Matter analytics process helps our business leaders identify the questions that matter most to our customers and partners. We focus our data science experts on answering those questions with innovative methodologies and transform our insights into targeted business actions. 
 Cigna is using advanced analytic capabilities throughout all facets of the business to:
  
 Identify and quantify the financial and clinical cost of discrete health opportunities and insights into how to best engage individual customers (e.g., digitally, phone, physician based). We convert these insights into a Health Matters Score that is used to connect each customer to the right clinical services and drive better clinical, financial, and quality outcomes. 

 Enable customized service experiences. In our pharmacy business we are proactively offering our customers value added pharmacy and medical services during inbound customer calls, realizing the value of an integrated medical and pharmacy offering. To maximize impact, we apply our proprietary Customer Segmentation models to tailor customer communications to make interactions more meaningful.

  
 Build a deep understanding of risk adjusted total cost and quality performance metrics at the individual physician level and aggregate market level to develop relative benchmarks. This data is being used to fuel our drive to fee for value physician reimbursements and flexible provider networks.

 Leverage advanced analytic models and tools to better identify prospects that best align with Cigna's mission and value proposition for our client engagement team. 

 Going forward, we view insights as a strategic imperative and will continue to heavily invest in expanding and strengthening our capabilities to meet and exceed our customer and partner expectations. 
   Quality Health Care 
 Our commitment to promoting quality health care to the people we serve is reflected in a variety of activities. 
   Health Improvement through Engaging Providers and Customers 
 Cigna improves health outcomes and reduces health care costs by engaging our customers in their health, connecting them with value-oriented providers, and improving how care is delivered and reimbursed. We are focused on executing our Connected Care strategy that engages both providers and customers, optimizing their interactions to drive better health, affordability, and experience. Cigna is committed to developing innovative solutions that span the health care delivery system and can be applied to different types of providers. Currently we have numerous collaborative arrangements with our participating health care providers and are actively developing new arrangements to support our Connected Care strategy. The key principles that guide our innovative solutions include:
  
 Improving access to care at the local market level, 

 Collaborating with and supporting providers in their evolution to value-based care, 

 Leveraging actionable patient information, enhancing the patient experience, 

 Improving affordability and

 Shifting reimbursement mechanisms to those that reward quality medical outcomes. 

 We continue to increase our engagement with physicians and hospitals by rapidly developing the types of arrangements discussed below. Over two million medical customers are currently serviced by more than 95,000 health care providers in these types of arrangements. 
  
Cigna Collaborative Care.  

Collaborative Accountable Care ("CAC") 
currently we have approximately 170 collaborative care arrangements with large primary care groups built on the patient-centered medical home and accountable care organization ("ACO") models. Our CAC
arrangements span 30 states and reach 1.9 million customers and we are committed to increasing the number of CACs over the next several years. Our goal is to reach approximately 190 of
these programs in 2017. 
Hospital Quality Incentive Program 
compensation paid to approximately 390 hospitals is tied to quality metrics and we expect to reach approximately 450 hospitals by the end of 2017.
Specialty Care Collaboration Program  we
continue to develop arrangements with specialists including programs such as National Obstetrics/Gynecology and our program to reimburse providers for individual "episodes of care" (services performed
to treat a specific medical condition). 




Independent Practice Associations are innovative physician engagement models in our Cigna-HealthSpring business that allow the physician groups to share financial outcomes with us. The Cigna-HealthSpring clinical model also includes outreach to new and at-risk patients to ensure they are accessing their primary care physician. 

 CareAllies.  On June 9, 2016, we announced the formation of CareAllies, the new U.S. based population health company focused on helping physicians manage the health of their patients and improve their health outcomes. CareAllies will partner with physicians, provider groups and health systems to develop customized solutions that help them meet their goals across all patients and all payers. 

 Delivery System Alliances.  Cigna is collaborating with select health care delivery systems to develop compelling and unique strategic relationships focused on addressing the local market's unique health care needs. This includes jointly developed products designed to improve the experience of Cigna customers by offering integrated health care and providing access to quality, value-based care in local communities.


 PART I ITEM 1. Business
 Cigna Guided Solutions® is Cigna's benefit administration and private exchange solution that targets clients who value fully integrated solutions and focus on engaging employees in their benefit offering. It leverages Cigna's ability to provide a fully integrated solution with our broad spectrum of products, benefit plans, services, and full suite of funding options focused on improving total cost, health, and productivity. Through Cigna Guided Solutions®, employers enjoy simplified administration and the convenience of single source purchasing while employees receive more choice via an easy-to-use shopping experience and year round engagement. Together with integrated robust decision-support tools, employees are able to make personalized decisions to select the right benefit offering and get the most value from their plans. 
 In addition, Cigna participates on many third party private exchanges. We actively evaluate private exchange participation opportunities as they emerge in the market, and target our participation to those models that best align with our mission and value proposition. 
 We employ sales representatives to distribute our products and services through insurance brokers and insurance consultants or directly to employers, unions and other groups or individuals. We also employ representatives to sell access to our national participating provider network, utilization review services, behavioral health care and pharmacy management services, and employee assistance services directly to insurance companies, HMOs and third party administrators. As of December 31, 2016, our field sales force consisted of over 1,300 sales representatives in 124 field locations. In our Government business, Medicare Advantage enrollment is generally a decision made individually by the customer, and accordingly, sales agents and representatives focus their efforts on in-person contacts with potential enrollees, as well as telephonic and group selling venues. 
   Competition 
 Our business is subject to intense competition and continuing industry consolidation that has created an even more competitive business environment. In certain geographic locations, some health care companies may have significant market share positions, but no one competitor dominates the health care market nationally. We expect a continuing trend of consolidation in the overall health care industry (including hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and providers of medical technology and devices) given the current economic and political environment. We also expect continued vertical integration with the lines blurring between clinicians, hospitals and traditional insurers. 
 Competition in the health care market exists both for employers and other groups sponsoring plans and for employees in those instances where the employer offers a choice of products from more than one health care company. Most group policies are subject to annual review by the plan sponsor, who may seek competitive quotations prior to renewal. In 2017, product offerings are decreasing in certain individual markets due to volatility in the industry as some carriers have exited markets. With the results of the 2016 U.S. elections, it is likely that changes will occur in the future to the Health Care Reform Act. Given that the relatively immature individual market has not yet reached profitability for most carriers, we expect some uncertainty and competitive volatility to continue. 
 The primary competitive factors affecting our business are quality and cost-effectiveness of service and provider networks; effectiveness of medical care management; products that meet the needs of employers and their employees; total cost management; technology; and effectiveness of marketing and sales. Financial strength of the insurer, as indicated by ratings issued by nationally recognized rating agencies, is also a competitive factor. We believe that our health advocacy capabilities, holistic approach to consumer engagement, breadth of product offerings, clinical care and medical management capabilities and array of product funding options are competitive advantages in meeting the diverse needs of our customer base. We also believe that our focus on helping to improve the health, well-being and sense of security of the customers we serve will allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. 
 Our primary competitors in our U.S.-based health care businesses include:
  
 Other national insurance and health services companies that provide group health and life insurance products, including Aetna, Anthem, Humana, Kaiser Permanente and UnitedHealth Group; 

 Not for profit managed care organizations; 

 Other regional stand-alone managed care and specialty companies; 

 Managed care organizations affiliated with major insurance companies and hospitals; and

 National managed pharmacy, behavioral health and utilization review services companies. 

 Our primary competitors in the international health care business include U.S.-based insurers such as Aetna, UnitedHealth Group and MetLife; global competitors such as BUPA and Allianz; and local insurers in a range of countries. 
 In addition to our traditional competitors, new competitors are emerging. Some of these newer competitors, such as hospitals and companies that offer web-based tools for employers and employees, are focused on delivering employee benefits and services through internet-enabled technology that allows consumers to take a more active role in the management of their health. This can be accomplished through financial incentives, access to enhanced quality medical data and other information sharing. The effective use of our health advocacy, customer insight and physician engagement capabilities, along with decision support tools (some of which are web-based) and enabling technology are critical to success in the health care industry, and we believe our capabilities in these areas will be competitive differentiators. 
   Industry Developments 
 The health insurance marketplace will continue to be shaped by the Health Care Reform Act over the near term; however, its future remains uncertain given the outcome of the 2016 U.S. elections. Although we anticipate changes in the regulation of the health insurance markets over the next several years as Congress and the Trump administration consider repeal and replacement of the Health Care Reform Act, the nature of those changes remains largely unknown at this time. See the "Regulation" and "Risk Factors" sections of the Form 10-K for additional discussion about these developments.

We continue to distinguish ourselves in the global supplemental health, life and accident businesses through our differentiated direct-to-consumer distribution, customer insights and marketing capabilities. We enter new markets when the opportunity to bring our product and health solutions is attractive. Over the past several years, we have continued to extend our product offerings and geographic reach. 
 
  
Principal Products and Services
-------------------------------

Supplemental Health, Life and Accident Insurance 
 Supplemental health, life and accident insurance products generally provide simple, affordable coverage of risks for the health and financial security of individuals. Supplemental health products provide specified payments for a variety of health risks and include personal accident, accidental death, critical illness, hospitalization, travel, dental, cancer and other dread disease coverages. We also offer customers individual private medical insurance, term and variable universal life insurance, and certain savings products. 
Medicare Supplement Plans 
 We offer individual Medicare Supplement plans that provide retirees with federally standardized Medigap-style plans. Retirees may select among the various plans with specific plan options to meet their unique needs and may visit, without the need for a referral, any health care professional or facility that accepts Medicare throughout the United States. 

Pricing and Reinsurance
-----------------------


Premium rates for our global supplemental benefits products are based on assumptions about mortality, morbidity, customer acquisition and retention, customer demographics, expenses and target profit margins, as well as interest rates. For variable universal life insurance products, fees consist of mortality, administrative, asset management and surrender charges assessed against the contractholder's fund balance. Mortality charges on variable universal life may be adjusted prospectively to reflect expected mortality experience. Most contracts permit premium rate changes at least annually. 
 Most of the businesses in this segment operate through foreign subsidiaries. We maintain a capital management strategy to retain overseas a significant portion of the earnings from these foreign operations. These undistributed earnings are deployed outside of the United States in support of the liquidity and capital requirements of our foreign operations. As a result, the effective tax rate for Global Supplemental Benefits reflects income tax expense that is generally lower than in the United States. 
 A global approach to underwriting risk management allows each local business to underwrite and accept risk within specified limits. Retentions are centrally managed through cost effective use of external reinsurance to limit our liability on per life, per risk, and per event (catastrophe) bases. 
 
  
Markets and Distribution
------------------------


Our supplemental health, life and accident insurance products sold in foreign countries are generally marketed through distribution partners with whom the individual insured has an affinity relationship. These products are sold primarily through direct marketing channels, such as outbound telemarketing, and in-branch bancassurance (when we partner with a bank and use the bank's sales channels to sell our insurance products). Marketing campaigns are conducted through these channels under a variety of arrangements with affinity partners, including banks, credit card companies and other financial and non-financial institutions. We also market directly to consumers via direct response television and the Internet. In certain countries, we market our products through captive and third party brokers and agents. Our Medicare supplement product line is distributed primarily through independent agents and telemarketing directly to the consumer.

 PART I ITEM 1. Business
 South Korea represents our single largest geographic market for Global Supplemental Benefits. For information on this concentration of risk for the Global Supplemental Benefits segment's business in South Korea, see "Other Items Affecting Results of Global Supplemental Benefits" in the Global Supplemental Benefits section of the MD&A beginning on page 51 of this Form 10-K. 
 For our supplemental health, life and accident insurance products sold in foreign markets we are increasingly exposed to geopolitical, currency and other risks inherent in foreign operations. Also, given that we bill and collect a significant portion of premiums through credit cards, a substantial contraction in consumer credit could impact our ability to retain existing policies and sell new policies. A decline in customer retention would result in both a reduction of revenue and an acceleration of the amortization of acquisition-related costs. Changes in regulation for permitted distribution channels also may impact our business or results. 
 
  
Competition
-----------


We expect that the competitive environment for global supplemental benefits will continue to intensify as U.S., Europe and other regionally-based insurance and financial services providers more aggressively pursue expansion opportunities across geographies, especially in Asia. We believe competitive factors will include branding, product and distribution innovation and differentiation, efficient management of marketing processes and costs, commission levels paid to distribution partners, the quality of claims, local network coverage, customer services and talent acquisition and retention. Additionally, in most overseas markets, perception of financial strength also will likely continue to be an important competitive factor. 
 Our competitors are primarily locally-based insurance companies, including insurance subsidiaries of banks primarily in Asia and Europe and multi-national companies. Insurance company competitors in this segment primarily focus on traditional product distribution through captive agents, with direct marketing being secondary channels. We estimate that we have less than 3% market share of the total insurance premiums in any given market in which we operate. 
 In the Medicare supplement business, the principal competitive factors are underwriting and pricing, relative operating efficiency, broker relations, and the quality of claims and customer service. Our primary competitors in this business include U.S.-based health insurance companies. 
 
  
Industry Developments
---------------------


Pressure on social health care systems, a rapidly aging population and increased wealth and education in developing insurance markets are leading to higher demand for products providing health insurance and financial security. In the supplemental health, life and accident business, direct marketing channels continue to grow and attract new competitors with industry consolidation among financial institutions and other affinity partners. 
 Data privacy regulation has tightened in all markets in the wake of data privacy news scandals, impacting affinity partner and customer attitudes toward direct marketing of insurance and other financial services.

PART I ITEM 1. Business 
 
  
Products and Services
---------------------

  Group Disability 
 Long-term and short-term group disability insurance products generally provide a fixed level of income to replace a portion of wages lost because of disability. Group disability coverage is typically employer-paid or a combination of employer and employee-paid, but also may include coverage paid for entirely by employees. As part of our group disability insurance products, we also provide assistance to employees in returning to work and assistance to their employers in managing the cost of employee disability. We are an industry leader in helping employees return to work quickly, resulting in higher productivity and lower cost for employers and a better quality of life for their employees. 
 We seek to integrate the administration of our disability insurance products with other disability benefit programs, behavioral programs, medical programs, social security advocacy, and administration of federal and state Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") laws and other leave of absence programs. We believe this integration provides our customers with increased efficiency and effectiveness in disability claims management, enhances productivity and reduces overall costs to employers. This integration also provides early insight into employees at risk for future disability claims. Coordinating the administration of these disability programs with medical programs offered by our health care business provides enhanced opportunities to influence outcomes, reduce the cost of both medical and disability events and improve the return to work rate. The benefits of this integrated approach also include:
  
 using information from the health care and disability databases to help identify, treat and manage disabilities before they become longer in duration or chronic and more costly; and 

 proactively reaching out to assist employees suffering from a mental health or chronic condition, either as a primary condition or as a result of another condition. 

 Our disability products and services are offered on a fully insured, experience-rated and ASO basis, although most are fully insured. As measured by 2016 premiums and fees, disability constituted 50% of this segment's business. Approximately 15,300 insured disability policies covering approximately 8.5 million lives were in force as of December 31, 2016. 
   Group Life Insurance 
 Group life insurance products offered include term life and universal life. Group term life insurance may be employer-paid basic life insurance, employee-paid supplemental life insurance or a combination thereof. Group universal life insurance is an employee-paid, voluntary life insurance product in which the owner may accumulate a cash value. The cash value earns interest at rates declared from time to time, subject to a minimum guaranteed contracted rate, and may be borrowed, withdrawn, or, within certain limits, used to fund future life insurance coverage. 
 As measured by 2016 premiums and fees, group life insurance constituted approximately 44% of this segment's business. Approximately 10,800 group life insurance policies covering over 7 million lives were in force as of December 31, 2016. 
   Other Products and Services 
 We also offer personal accident insurance coverage, consisting primarily of accidental death and dismemberment and travel accident insurance to employers. Group accident insurance may be employer-paid or employee-paid. In addition, we offer specialty insurance services that consist primarily of disability and life, accident, and hospital indemnity products to professional or trade associations and financial institutions. 
 We also provide a number of voluntary products and services that are typically paid by the employee and offered at the employer's worksite. Our plans provide employers with administrative solutions designed to provide employers with a complete and simple way to manage their benefits program. In recent years, we have brought to market three additional voluntary offerings  accidental injury insurance, critical illness coverage and hospital care. These products provide additional dollar payouts to employees for unexpected accidents or more serious illnesses. 
 
  
Pricing and Reinsurance
-----------------------


Premiums charged for disability and term life insurance products are usually established in advance of the policy period and are generally guaranteed for one to three years and selectively guaranteed for up to five years; policies are generally subject to termination by the policyholder or by the insurance company annually. Premium rates reflect assumptions about future claims, expenses, credit risk, investment returns and profit margins. These assumptions may be based in whole or in part on prior experience of the account or on a pool of accounts, depending on the group size and the statistical credibility of the experience that varies by product. 
 Premiums for group universal life insurance products consist of mortality and administrative charges assessed against the policyholder's fund balance. Interest credited and mortality charges for group universal life may be adjusted prospectively to reflect expected interest and mortality experience. Mortality charges are subject to maximum guaranteed rates and interest credited on cash values is subject to minimum guaranteed rates as stated in the policy. 
 The premiums for these products are typically collected within the coverage year and then invested in assets that match the duration of the expected benefit payments that occur over many future years (primarily for disability benefits). With significant investments in longer-duration securities, net investment income is a critical element of profitability for this segment. 
 The effectiveness of return to work programs and morbidity levels will impact the profitability of disability insurance products. Our previous claim experience and industry data indicate a correlation between disability claim incidence levels and economic conditions, with submitted claims rising under adverse economic conditions, although this impact is not clear. For life insurance products, the degree to which future experience deviates from mortality and expense assumptions also affects profitability. 
 To reduce our exposure to large individual and catastrophic losses under group life, disability and accidental death policies, as well as our newer accidental injury and critical illness policies, we purchase reinsurance from a diverse group of unaffiliated reinsurers. Our comprehensive

 reinsurance program consists of excess of loss treaties and catastrophe coverage designed to mitigate earnings volatility and provide surplus protection. 
 
  
Markets and Distribution
------------------------


We market our group disability and life insurance products and services to employers, employees, professional and other associations and groups in the National, Middle Market and Select segments. In marketing these products, we primarily sell through insurance brokers and consultants and employ a direct sales force consisting of approximately 260 sales professionals in 27 office locations as of December 31, 2016. 
 
  
Competition
-----------


The principal competitive factors that affect the Group Disability and Life segment are underwriting and pricing, the quality and effectiveness of claims management, relative operating efficiency, investment and risk management, distribution methodologies and producer relations, the breadth and variety of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service. For certain products with longer-term liabilities, such as group long-term disability insurance, the financial strength of the insurer, as indicated by ratings issued by nationally recognized rating agencies, is also a competitive factor. 
 The principal competitors of our group disability, life and accident businesses are other large and regional insurance companies that market and distribute these or similar types of products and include Aetna, Unum, The Hartford, Prudential and MetLife. As of December 31, 2016, we are one of the top five providers of group disability, life and accident insurance in the United States, based on premiums. 
 
  
Industry Developments
---------------------


Employers are expressing a growing interest in employee wellness, absence management and productivity and likewise are recognizing a strong link between employee health, productivity and their profitability. As this interest grows, we believe our healthy lifestyle and return-to-work programs and integrated family medical leave, disability and health care programs position us to deliver integrated solutions for employers and employees. We also believe that our strong disability management portfolio and fully integrated programs provide tools for employers and employees to improve health status. This focus on managing the employee's total absence enables us to increase the number and effectiveness of interventions and minimize disabling events. 
 The group insurance market remains highly competitive as the rising cost of providing medical coverage to employees has forced companies to re-evaluate their overall employee benefit spending, resulting in lower volumes of group disability and life insurance business and more competitive pricing. Demographic shifts have further driven demand for products and services that are sufficiently flexible to meet the evolving needs of employers and employees who want innovative, cost-effective solutions to their insurance needs. Employers continue to shift towards greater employee participatory coverage and voluntary purchases. With our broad suite of voluntary offerings and continued focus on developing additional voluntary products and service capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to meet the needs of both employers and employees as the market shifts to become more retail-focused. 
 Over the past few years, there has been heightened review by state regulators of the claims handling practices within the disability and life insurance industry. This has resulted in an increase in coordinated, multi-state examinations that target specific market practices in addition to regularly recurring examinations of an insurer's overall operations conducted by an individual state's regulators. We have recently been subject to such an examination. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 The depressed level of interest rates in the United States over the last several years has constrained earnings growth in this segment due to lower yields on our fixed-income investments, and higher benefit expenses resulting from the discounting of future claim payments at lower interest rates. 

  
Other Operations
----------------


Other Operations includes the following four businesses: 
 
  
Corporate-owned Life Insurance
------------------------------


The principal products of the COLI business are permanent insurance contracts sold to corporations to provide coverage on the lives of certain employees for the purpose of financing employer-paid future benefit obligations. Permanent life insurance provides coverage that, when adequately funded, does not expire after a term of years. The contracts are primarily non-participating universal life policies. Fees for universal life insurance products consist primarily of mortality and administrative charges assessed against the policyholder's fund balance. Interest credited and mortality charges for universal life and mortality charges on variable universal life may be adjusted prospectively to reflect expected interest and mortality experience. To reduce our exposure to large individual and catastrophe losses, we purchase reinsurance from unaffiliated reinsurers. 
 
  
Run-off Settlement Annuity Business
-----------------------------------


Our settlement annuity business is a closed, run-off block of single premium annuity contracts. These contracts are primarily liability settlements with approximately 20% of the liabilities associated with payments that are guaranteed and not contingent on survivorship. For contracts that involve non-guaranteed payments, such payments are contingent on the survival of one or more parties involved in the settlement.

Run-off Reinsurance
-------------------


Our reinsurance operations are an inactive business in run-off mode. 
 In February 2013, we effectively exited the guaranteed minimum death benefit ("GMDB") and guaranteed minimum income benefit ("GMIB") business by reinsuring 100% of our future exposures, net of retrocessional arrangements in place at that time, up to a specified limit. For additional information regarding this reinsurance transaction and the arrangements that secure our reinsurance recoverables, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
  
Individual Life Insurance and Annuity and Retirement Benefits Businesses
------------------------------------------------------------------------


This business includes deferred gains recognized from the 1998 sale of the individual life insurance and annuity business and the 2004 sale of the retirement benefits business. For more information regarding the arrangements that secure our reinsurance recoverables for the retirement benefits business, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

  
Investments and Investment Income
---------------------------------


General Accounts
----------------


Our investment operations provide investment management and related services for our corporate invested assets and the insurance-related invested assets in our General Account ("General Account Invested Assets"). We acquire or originate, directly or through intermediaries, a broad range of investments including private placement and public securities, commercial mortgage loans, real estate, mezzanine, private equity partnerships and short-term investments. Invested assets also include policy loans that are fully collateralized by insurance policy cash values. Invested assets are managed primarily by our subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, external managers with whom our subsidiaries contract. Net investment income is included as a component of adjusted income from operations for each of our reporting segments and Corporate. Realized investment gains (losses) are reported by segment but excluded from adjusted income from operations. For additional information about invested assets, see the "Investment Assets" section of the MD&A beginning on page 53 and Notes 10 to 12 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We manage our investment portfolios to reflect the underlying characteristics of related insurance and contractholder liabilities and capital requirements, as well as regulatory and tax considerations pertaining to those liabilities and state investment laws. Insurance and contractholder liabilities range from short duration health care products to longer term obligations associated with disability and life insurance products and the run-off settlement annuity business. Assets supporting these liabilities are managed in segregated investment portfolios to facilitate matching of asset durations and cash flows to those of corresponding liabilities. Investment strategy and results are affected by the amount and timing of cash available for investment, competition for investments, economic conditions, interest rates and asset allocation decisions. We routinely monitor and evaluate the status of our investments, obtaining and analyzing relevant investment-specific information and assessing current economic conditions, trends in capital markets and other factors such as industry sector, geographic and property-specific information.

Our subsidiaries or external advisors manage Separate Account invested assets on behalf of contractholders; including the Cigna Pension Plan, variable universal life products sold through our corporate-owned life insurance business, and other disability and life products. These assets are legally segregated from our other businesses and are not included in General Account Invested Assets. Income, gains and losses generally accrue directly to the contractholders. 

  
Regulation
----------


The laws and regulations governing our business continue to increase each year and are subject to frequent change. We are regulated by state, federal and international regulatory agencies that generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. These regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact the health care system. 
 Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. These subsidiaries are subject to numerous state, federal and international regulations related to their business operations, including, but not limited to:
  
 the form and content of customer contracts including benefit mandates (including special requirements for small groups);  

 premium rates and medical loss ratios; 

 the content of agreements with participating providers of covered services; 

 producer appointment and compensation; 

 claims processing, payment and appeals; 

 underwriting practices; 

 reinsurance arrangements; 

 solvency and financial reporting; 

 unfair trade and claim practices; 

 market conduct; 

 protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the information received from customers;

 risk sharing arrangements with providers; 

 reimbursement or payment levels for Medicare services; 

 advertising; and 

 the operation of consumer-directed plans (including health savings accounts, health reimbursement accounts, flexible spending accounts and debit cards). 

 The business of administering and insuring employee benefit programs in the United States, particularly health care programs, is heavily regulated by state and federal laws and administrative agencies, such as state departments of insurance, and federal agencies including HHS, CMS, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and the Departments of Labor, Treasury and Justice, as well as the courts. Health savings accounts, health reimbursement accounts and flexible spending accounts also are regulated by the Department of the Treasury and the IRS. 
 Our operations, accounts and other books and records are subject to examination at regular intervals by regulatory agencies, including state insurance and health and welfare departments, state boards of pharmacy, CMS and comparable international regulators to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, our current and past business practices are subject to review by, and from time to time we receive subpoenas and other requests of information from various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities, attorneys general, the Office of Inspector General ("OIG"), the Department of Labor and other state, federal and international authorities, including inquiries by, and testimony before committees and subcommittees of the U.S. Congress regarding certain of our business practices. These examinations, reviews, subpoenas and requests may result in changes to or clarifications of our business practices, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions. 
 Our international subsidiaries are subject to regulations in international jurisdictions where foreign insurers may be faced with more onerous regulations than their domestic competitors. In addition, the expansion of our operations into foreign countries increases our exposure to certain U.S. laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA"). See page 19 for further discussion of international regulations. 
   The Health Care Reform Act 
 The Health Care Reform Act mandated broad changes affecting insured and self-insured health benefit plans that impact our current business model, including our relationship with current and future customers, producers and health care providers, products, services, processes and technology. As a result of the 2016 U.S. elections, the future of the Health Care Reform Act is uncertain. Certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Act are likely to be retained, while others are likely to be repealed or replaced. 
 Key Provisions of the Health Care Reform Act 
 Various fees, including the health insurance industry tax and the reinsurance fee, were assessed beginning in 2014. The health insurance industry assessment, totaling $11.3 billion for the industry in 2016 and increasing to $14.3 billion by 2018, is not tax deductible. In December 2015, the federal appropriations legislation imposed a one-year moratorium on the industry tax for 2017, with reinstatement expected in 2018. Our share of this industry tax is determined based on our proportion of premiums for both our commercial and government risk businesses to the industry total. The reinsurance fee is a temporary (2014-2016) fixed dollar per customer levy on all insurers, HMOs and self-insured group health plans and is tax deductible. 
 The health insurance exchange enrollment process began on October 1, 2013 with coverage first effective in 2014. Each state has a state-based, a state and federal partnership, or a federally-facilitated health insurance exchange for individuals and small employer groups to purchase insurance coverage. Because individuals seeking to purchase health insurance coverage either on or off the exchanges are guaranteed to be issued a policy, the Health Care Reform Act provided programs designed to reduce the risk for participating health insurance companies including: (1) a temporary (2014-2016) reinsurance program; and (2) a premium stabilization program comprised of two components: a temporary program (2014-2016) limiting insurer gains and losses ("risk corridor"), and a permanent program that adjusts premiums based on the relative health status of the customer base ("risk adjustment"). See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Introduction to the MD&A contained in this Form 10-K for additional information on these programs. 
 MLR requirements, as prescribed by HHS, require payment of premium rebates to group and individual policyholders if certain annual MLRs are not met in our commercial business. In December 2014, the federal government enacted legislation that provides permanent relief from certain Health Care Reform Act requirements for expatriate health coverage (including the MLR requirements). 
 Other provisions of the Health Care Reform Act in effect include reduced Medicare Advantage premium rates, the requirement to cover preventive services with no enrollee cost-sharing, banning the use of lifetime and annual limits on the dollar amount of essential health benefits, increasing restrictions on rescinding coverage and extending coverage of dependents to the age of 26. The employer mandate, the phase in of which was complete in 2016, requires employers with 50 or more full-time employees to offer affordable health insurance that provides minimum value (each as defined under the Health Care Reform Act) to full-time employees and dependent children up to age 26 or be subject to penalties based on employer size. The Health Care Reform Act also changed certain tax laws that effectively limit tax deductions for certain employee compensation paid by health insurers. 
 Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan businesses also have been impacted by the Health Care Reform Act in a variety of additional ways, including mandated minimum reductions to risk scores, transition of Medicare Advantage "benchmark" rates to Medicare fee-for-service parity, reduced enrollment periods and limitations on disenrollment, providing "quality bonuses" for Medicare Advantage plans with a rating of four or five stars from CMS and mandated consumer discounts on brand name and generic prescription drugs for Medicare Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. The Health Care Reform Act requires Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans to meet a minimum MLR of 85%. Under the finalized regulations promulgated by HHS, if the MLR for a CMS contract is less than 85%, we are required to pay a penalty to CMS and could be required to make additional payments if the MLR continues to be less than 85% for successive years. Through the Health Care Reform Act and other federal legislation, funding for Medicare Advantage plans has been and may continue to be altered. 
 We have implemented the provisions of the Health Care Reform Act currently in effect. Management continues to be actively engaged with regulators and policymakers with respect to rule-making. However, ongoing legislative and regulatory challenges to the Health Care Reform

 Act, pending litigation challenging aspects of the law, the change in administration and the Congress following the 2016 U.S. elections will continue to create uncertainty about the ultimate impact of the Health Care Reform Act. Additionally, the executive order signed by President Trump in January 2017, which instructs agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Health Care Reform Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, providers, insurers, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurers or makers of medical devices, products or medications, will create additional uncertainty. 
 For the financial effects of certain Health Care Reform Act provisions, see the "Executive Overview" section of our MD&A beginning on page 36 of this Form 10-K. In addition, accounting policies around the government's risk mitigation programs are further disclosed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
  
Regulation of Insurance Companies
---------------------------------

  Financial Reporting, Internal Control and Corporate Governance 
 Regulators closely monitor the financial condition of licensed insurance companies and HMOs. States regulate the form and content of statutory financial statements, the type and concentration of permitted investments, and corporate governance over financial reporting. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries are required to file periodic financial reports and schedules with regulators in most of the jurisdictions in which they do business as well as annual financial statements audited by independent registered public accounting firms. Certain insurance and HMO subsidiaries are required to file an annual report of internal control over financial reporting with most jurisdictions in which they do business. Insurance and HMO subsidiaries' operations and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies. Many states have expanded regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of insurance and HMO subsidiaries as a result of model regulations adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") with elements similar to corporate governance and risk oversight disclosure requirements under federal securities laws. 
 Guaranty Associations, Indemnity Funds, Risk Pools and Administrative Funds 
 Most states and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions require insurance companies to support guaranty associations or indemnity funds that are established to pay claims on behalf of insolvent insurance companies. In the United States, these associations levy assessments on member insurers licensed in a particular state to pay such claims. Certain states require HMOs to participate in guaranty funds, special risk pools and administrative funds. For additional information about guaranty fund and other assessments, see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Certain states continue to require health insurers and HMOs to participate in assigned risk plans, joint underwriting authorities, pools or other residual market mechanisms to cover risks not acceptable under normal underwriting standards, although some states have eliminated these requirements as a result of the Health Care Reform Act. 
   Solvency and Capital Requirements 
 Many states have adopted some form of the NAIC model solvency-related laws and risk-based capital rules ("RBC rules") for life and health insurance companies. The RBC rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments held, the types of business written and the types of liabilities incurred. If the ratio of the insurer's adjusted surplus to its risk-based capital falls below statutory required minimums, the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship. 
 In addition, various non-U.S. jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements that are based upon solvency, liquidity and reserve coverage measures. Our HMOs and life and health insurance subsidiaries, as well as non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries, are compliant with applicable RBC and non-U.S. surplus rules. 
 The Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act ("ORSA"), adopted by the NAIC, provides requirements and principles for maintaining a group solvency assessment and a risk management framework and reflects a broader approach to U.S. insurance regulation. ORSA includes a requirement to file an annual ORSA Summary Report in the lead state of domicile. To date, an overwhelming majority of the states have adopted the same or similar versions of ORSA. 
   Holding Company Laws 
 Our domestic insurance companies and certain of our HMOs are subject to state laws regulating subsidiaries of insurance holding companies. Under such laws, certain dividends, distributions and other transactions between an insurance company or an HMO subsidiary and its affiliates may require notification to, or approval by, one or more state insurance commissioners. In addition, the holding company acts of states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO subsidiary without prior regulatory approval. 
 Marketing, Advertising and Products 
 In most states, our insurance companies and HMO subsidiaries are required to certify compliance with applicable advertising regulations on an annual basis. Our insurance companies and HMO subsidiaries are also required by most states to file and secure regulatory approval of products prior to the marketing, advertising, and sale of such products. 
 Licensing Requirements 
 Certain of our subsidiaries are pharmacies that dispense prescription drugs to participants of benefit plans administered or insured by our HMO and insurance company subsidiaries. These pharmacy-subsidiaries are subject to state licensing requirements and regulation as well as U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency registration requirements, U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements and third party accreditation

 requirements. Other laws and regulations affecting our pharmacy-subsidiaries include federal and state laws concerning labeling, packaging, advertising, handling and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. 
 Certain subsidiaries contract to provide claim administration, utilization management and other related services for the administration of self-insured benefit plans. These subsidiaries may be subject to state third-party administration and other licensing requirements and regulation, as well as third party accreditation requirements. 
 Our international subsidiaries are often required to be licensed when entering new markets or starting new operations in certain jurisdictions. The licensure requirements for these subsidiaries vary by country and are subject to change. 
 
  
Other Federal and State Regulations
-----------------------------------

  Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Public Health Service Act 
 Our domestic subsidiaries sell most of their products and services to sponsors of employee benefit plans that are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). ERISA is a complex set of federal laws and regulations enforced by the IRS and the Department of Labor, as well as the courts. Our domestic subsidiaries are subject to requirements imposed by ERISA affecting claim payment and appeals procedures for individual health insurance and insured and self-insured group health plans and for the insured dental, disability, life and accident plans we administer. Our domestic subsidiaries also may contractually agree to comply with these requirements on behalf of the self-insured dental, disability, life and accident plans they administer. 
 Many provisions of the Health Care Reform Act impacting insured and self-insured group health plans were incorporated into ERISA. The health insurance reform provisions under ERISA were also incorporated into the Public Health Service Act and are directly applicable to health insurance issuers (i.e., health insurers and HMOs). 
 Plans subject to ERISA also can be subject to state laws and the legal question of whether and to what extent ERISA preempts a state law will continue to be subject to court interpretation. 
   Medicare and Medicaid Regulations 
 Several of our subsidiaries engage in businesses that are subject to federal Medicare regulations, such as:
  
 those offering individual and group Medicare Advantage coverage; and 

 those offering Medicare Pharmacy (Part D) products. 

 In our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D business, we contract with CMS to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries. As a result, our ability to obtain payment (and the determination of the amount of such payments), enroll and retain members and expand into new service areas is subject to compliance with CMS' numerous and complex regulations and requirements that are frequently modified and subject to administrative discretion. Marketing and sales activities (including those of third-party brokers and agents) are also heavily regulated by CMS and other governmental agencies, including applicable state departments of insurance. We will continue to allocate significant resources to our compliance, ethics and fraud and waste and abuse programs to comply with the laws and regulations governing Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D programs. 
 The Health Care Reform Act ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan's and Medicare Part D plan's reimbursement to the plan's "Star Rating" by CMS, with those plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for quality-based bonus payments. The Star Rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, for example, quality of care, preventative services, chronic illness management, coverage appeals and customer satisfaction. 
 Our Medicaid and dual eligible products are also regulated by CMS and state Medicaid agencies that audit our performance to determine compliance with contracts and regulations. We continue to work in collaboration with applicable state agencies regarding our Medicaid plans in Texas and Illinois to ensure ongoing compliance and sustainability. 
 Several of our subsidiaries are also subject to reporting requirements pursuant to Section 111 of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007, that requires us to report specific information regarding claimants and claim settlements involving Medicare participants so CMS can recover Medicare funds expended to provide healthcare treatment to the claimant. Strict sanctions, including fines and penalties, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with these reporting obligations. 
   Federal and State Audits of Government Sponsored Health Care Programs 
 Participation in government sponsored health care programs subjects us to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations and risks associated with audits conducted under these programs. These audits may occur in years subsequent to our providing the relevant services. These risks may include reimbursement claims as well as potential fines and penalties, such as restrictions on our ability to participate or expand our presence in certain programs. For example, with respect to our Medicare Advantage business, CMS and the OIG perform audits to determine a health plan's compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations, including compliance with proper coding practices (sometimes referred to as "Risk Adjustment Data Validation Audits" or "RADV audits") and compliance with fraud and abuse enforcement practices through Recovery Audit Contractor ("RAC") audits in which third-party contractors conduct post-payment reviews on a contingency fee basis to detect and correct improper payments. In addition, negative performance points may be accumulated if we do not perform satisfactorily during an audit that could restrict our ability to expand our Medicare Advantage business geographically. 
 In January 2016, following an audit, CMS issued a Notice of Imposition of Immediate Intermediate Sanctions (the "Notice") to the Company. The Notice required us to suspend certain enrollment and marketing activities for Medicare Advantage-Prescription Drug and Medicare Part D Plans. The sanctions do not impact the right of current enrollees to remain covered by our Medicare Advantage-Prescription Drug or Medicare Part D Plans. We are working with CMS to address the audit findings as quickly as possible. See "Business  Global Health Care" beginning on page 3 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our participation in government health-related programs.

 PART I ITEM 1. Business
 The federal government has made investigating and prosecuting health care fraud, waste and abuse a priority. Fraud, waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for inducement to refer customers, billing for unnecessary medical services, coding, network adequacy, improper marketing, and violation of patient privacy rights. The regulations and contractual requirements in this area are complex, are frequently modified, and are subject to administrative discretion and judicial interpretation. We expect to continue to allocate significant resources to comply with these regulations and requirements and to maintain audit readiness. 
 Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulations 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations ("HIPAA") imposes minimum standards on health insurers, HMOs, health plans, health care providers and clearinghouses for the privacy and security of protected health information. HIPAA also established rules that standardize the format and content of certain electronic transactions, including, but not limited to, eligibility and claims. 
 HIPAA's privacy and security requirements were expanded by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH") through additional contracting requirements for covered entities, the extension of privacy and security provisions to business associates, the requirement to provide notification to various parties in the event of a data breach of protected health information, and enhanced financial penalties for HIPAA violations, including potential criminal penalties for individuals. 
 The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally places restrictions on the disclosure of non-public information to non-affiliated third parties, and requires financial institutions, including insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal information is used, including an opportunity to "opt out" of certain disclosures. State departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted implementing regulations as required by federal law. 
 A number of states have adopted data security laws and regulations regulating data security and requiring security breach notification that may apply to us in certain circumstances. Neither HIPAA nor the Gramm-Leach-Bliley privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations. In addition, international laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of personal information are generally more stringent than in the United States, and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. 
   Consumer Protection Laws 
 We engage in direct-to-consumer activities and are increasingly offering mobile and web-based solutions to our customers. We are therefore subject to federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and other consumer protection laws and regulations, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the CAN-SPAM Act. In particular, the Federal Trade Commission is increasingly exercising its enforcement authority in the areas of consumer privacy and data security, with a focus on web-based, mobile data and "big data." 
   Dodd-Frank Act and Investment-Related Regulations 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") provides for a number of reforms and regulations in the corporate governance, financial reporting and disclosure, investments, tax and enforcement areas. The Dodd-Frank Act established a Federal Insurance Office (the "FIO") to develop federal policy on insurance matters. While the FIO does not have authority over health insurance, it may have authority over other parts of our business, such as life insurance. Additional rulemaking by the SEC and other regulatory authorities continues. In February 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a review of the Dodd-Frank Act. We continue to monitor how these regulations might impact us. 
 Depending upon their nature, our investment management activities are subject to U.S. federal securities laws, ERISA and other federal and state laws governing investment related activities. In many cases, the investment management activities and investments of individual insurance companies are subject to regulation by multiple jurisdictions. 
   Office of Foreign Assets Control Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering 
 We also are subject to regulation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes. 
 Certain of our products are subject to Department of the Treasury anti-money laundering regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act. 
 In addition, we may be subject to similar regulations in non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. 
   Antitrust Regulations 
 Federal and state antitrust regulators, such as the Department of Justice and certain state attorneys general, have opposed the proposed merger with Anthem. See Notes 3 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information about the proposed merger. In addition, our subsidiaries also engage in activities that may be scrutinized under federal and state antitrust laws and regulations. These activities include the administration of strategic alliances with competitors, information sharing with competitors and provider contracting. 

International Regulations
-------------------------


Our operations outside the United States expose us to laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies and regulators, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, data protection, data mining, data transfer, intellectual property, labor and employment, consumer protection, direct-to-consumer communications activities, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering. Foreign laws and rules may include requirements that are different from or more stringent than similar requirements in the United States.

 PART I ITEM 1. Business
 Our operations in countries outside the United States:
  
 are subject to local regulations of the jurisdictions where customers reside, 

 in some cases, are subject to regulations in the locations of customers, and 

 in all cases, are subject to the FCPA. 

 The FCPA prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official or employee to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Outside of the United States, we may interact with government officials in several different capacities: as regulators of our insurance business; as clients or partners who are state-owned or partially state-owned; as health care professionals who are employed by the government; and as hospitals that are state-owned. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to FCPA. The UK Bribery Act of 2010 applies to all companies with a nexus to the United Kingdom. Under this act, any voluntary disclosures of FCPA violations may be shared with United Kingdom authorities, thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions. 
 If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing our international operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions that could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. See the Risk Factors section beginning on page 21 for a discussion of risks related to our global operations. 

Miscellaneous
-------------


Premiums and fees from CMS represented 20% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 under a number of contracts. We are not dependent on business from one or a few customers. Other than CMS, no one customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in 2016. We are not dependent on business from one or a few brokers or agents. In addition, our insurance businesses are generally not committed to accept a fixed portion of the business submitted by independent brokers and agents, and generally all such business is subject to approval and acceptance. 
 We had approximately 41,000 employees as of December 31, 2016; 39,300 employees as of December 31, 2015; and 37,200 employees as of December 31, 2014.
