ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Currently, we are engaged in the manufacture and sales of textile dyeing and finishing machines and sharing economy businesses.
 
Through December 30, 2016, we operated in the forged rolled rings and related components segment, in which we manufactured and sold precision forged rolled rings, shafts, flanges, and other forged components for the energy industry including wind power and other industries. On December 30, 2016, we sold the stock in the entity that was engaged in the forged rolled rings and related components segment. Accordingly, the forged rolled rings and related components business is reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 
During 2016, we manufactured and sold petroleum and chemical equipment. We referred to this business as our petroleum and chemical equipment business. Because of a significant decline in revenues from this business, we determined that we would not continue to operate in this segment and accordingly, we reflect the operations of the petroleum and chemical equipment segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 
Through our dyeing and finishing equipment segment, we design, manufacture and distribute a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry. Our products feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are used in dyeing yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. We are continuing to seek to utilize our expertise in manufacturing precision products to meet demand in new and existing end markets.
 
We design and produce airflow dyeing machines, which use air instead of water. Water is used in the traditional dyeing process. We believe that our air-flow technology, which is designed to enable users to meet the stricter environmental standards, results in reduced input costs, fewer wrinkles, less damage to the textile, and reduced emissions. The Chinese government requires textile manufacturers to phase out older machinery that does not meet the new environmental standards, which, we believe will increase the need for equipment that complies there the Chinese government standards. Although our revenue from this segment declined in 2016, in the long-term we expect to increase our revenue from this segment. Our new after-treatment drying and compacting machine is used in the final finishing of knitted material, such as cotton, and is designed to improve the softness, reduce shrinkage and ensure better dimensional stability. We developed a new garment washing machine for denim. Made of stainless steel and customized for use by Chinese jeans manufacturers, the machine is capable of stone wash, enzyme wash and other water washing techniques.
 
In August 2016, we purchased a patent technology use right for a ten-year term from a third party. The patent covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. We believe this patent technology will allow us to develop next generation dyeing and finishing equipment that will appeal to textile manufacturers in China as well as Southeastern Asia, particularly Vietnam and Bangladesh. We have developed a few prototypes based on this patent technology and have begun taking orders in small quantities.
 
On December 26, 2016, Dyeing and an unrelated individual formed Wuxi Shengxin New Energy Engineering Co., Ltd. (“Shengxin”), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the PRC in which Dyeing has a 30% equity interest and the unrelated third party holds a 70% interest, pursuant to an agreement dated December 23, 2016. Shengxin intends to develop, construct and maintain photovoltaic power generation projects, known as solar farms, in China, mainly in the provinces of GuiZhou and YunNan. At December 31, 2016, Shengxin had not yet commenced operations. During the project construction period, we will have the priority to provide components and equipment such as: solar racking and mounting systems for the projects under the same conditions as the other vendors. During 2017, Shengxin has located a number of projects and also has discussions with various local government entities and incurred minor expenses in 2017 including due diligence expenses, land survey expenses and other miscellaneous expenses related to these potential projects. However, given the decrease in the Chinese government subsidies for utility scale solar projects in 2017 as well as the high cost of solar components, Shengxin has not been able to locate any project which it believes could yield an expected leveraged internal rate of return of higher than 12%. Accordingly, Shengxin has not invested into any solar projects.
 
Throughout 2017, we made significant changes in the overall direction of the Company. Given the headwinds affecting our manufacturing business, we are targeting high growth opportunities and have established new business divisions to focus on the development of sharing economy platforms and related rental businesses within the company. These initiatives are still in an early stage. We did not generate significant revenues from our sharing economy business initiatives in 2017.

Reverse Split; Change in Authorized Common Stock
 
On February 24, 2017, we filed a certificate of change which effected a one-for-four reverse split, which became effective in the marketplace on March 20, 2017, and a reduction in our authorized common stock from 50,000,000 shares to 12,500,000 shares. All share and per share information in this Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect this reverse split.
Organization
 
We are a Nevada corporation. We were incorporated in Delaware on June 24, 1987 under the name Malex, Inc. We changed our corporate name to China Wind Systems, Inc. on December 18, 2007. On June 13, 2011, we changed our corporate name to Cleantech Solutions International, Inc. On August 7, 2012, we were converted into a Nevada corporation. On January 8, 2018, Nasdaq approved our corporate name change to Sharing Economy International Inc. 
 
We are the sole stockholder of Fulland Limited, a Cayman Islands limited liability company organized on May 9, 2007. Fulland owns 100% of the capital stock of Green Power Environment Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (“Green Power”) and, until December 30, 2016, Fulland owned 100% of Wuxi Fulland Wind Energy Equipment Co., Ltd. (“Fulland Wind”). Green Power is and Fulland Wind was a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (“WFOE”) organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”).
 
Fulland Wind was formed on August 27, 2008. In 2009, the Company began to produce and sell forged products through Fulland Wind. Through Fulland Wind, we manufactured and sold forged products, including wind products such as shafts, rolled rings, gear rims, gearboxes, bearings and other components and finished products and assemblies for the wind power and other industries, including large-scale equipment used in the manufacturing process for the various industries. We referred to this segment of its business as the forged rolled rings and related components segment. On December 30, 2016, Fulland sold the stock of Fulland Wind and accordingly, the forged rolled rings and related components business is reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As of December 31, 2017, Fulland Wind had bank loans payable of RMB 4,500,000 (approximately $647,967) which were guaranteed by Dyeing and the Company’s chief executive officer and his wife. As of December 31, 2017, these loans had been paid in full by Fulland Wind. 
 
Green Power is a party to a series of contractual arrangements dated October 12, 2007 with Wuxi Huayang Heavy Industries, Co., Ltd. (“Heavy Industries”) and Wuxi Huayang Dyeing Machinery Co., Ltd. (“Dyeing”) which are sometimes collectively referred to as the “Huayang Companies.” The Huayang Companies, both of which are limited liability companies organized under the laws of, and based in, the PRC, and their stockholders, who are our chief executive officer, Jianhua Wu, and his wife, Lihua Tang. Our corporate organizational structure, including the contractual arrangements with the Huayang Companies, is designed to comply with certain laws and regulations of the PRC which restrict the manner in which Chinese companies, particularly companies owned by Chinese residents, may raise funds from non-Chinese sources.
 
The Company's latest business initiatives are focused on targeting the technology and global sharing economy markets, by developing online platforms and rental business partnerships that will drive the global development of sharing through economical rental business models.
 
The following table sets forth our relationship our subsidiaries and the variable interest entities whose financial statements are consolidated with ours.

Our relationships with the Huayang Companies and their stockholders are governed by a series of contractual arrangements between Green Power, our wholly foreign owned enterprise in the PRC, and each of the Huayang Companies, which are our operating companies in the PRC. Under PRC laws, each of Green Power, Dyeing and Heavy Industries is an independent legal person and none of them is exposed to liabilities incurred by the other parties. Other than pursuant to the contractual arrangements between Green Power and the Huayang Companies described below, generally, neither of the Huayang Companies transfers any other funds generated from its operations to the other Huayang Company. On October 12, 2007, we entered into the following contractual arrangements with each of the Huayang Companies.
 
Consulting Services Agreement. Pursuant to the exclusive consulting services agreements between Green Power and each of the Huayang Companies, Green Power has the exclusive right to provide to the Huayang Companies general business operation services, including advice and strategic planning, as well as consulting services related to the technological research and development of dye and finishing machines, electrical equipment and related products. Under this agreement, Green Power owns the intellectual property rights developed or discovered through research and development, in the course of providing its services under the agreement, or derived from the provision of the services. The Huayang Companies shall pay a quarterly consulting service fees to Green Power that is equal to all of the Huayang Companies’ profits for such quarter. The term of this agreement, as amended on November 1, 2008, is 20 years from October 12, 2007 and may be extended only upon Green Power’s written confirmation prior to the expiration of the agreement, with the extended term to be mutually agreed upon by the parties.

Pursuant to the operating agreement among Green Power, the Huayang Companies and all stockholders of the Huayang Companies, Green Power provides guidance and instruction on the Huayang Companies’ daily operations, financial management and employment issues. The Huayang Companies stockholders must designate the candidates recommended by Green Power as their representatives on the boards of directors of each of the Huayang Companies. Green Power has the right to appoint senior executives of the Huayang Companies. In addition, Green Power agrees to guarantee the Huayang Companies’ performance under any agreements or arrangements relating to the Huayang Companies’ business arrangements with any third party. The Huayang Companies, in return, agrees to pledge their accounts receivable and all of their assets to Green Power. Moreover, the Huayang Companies agree that without the prior consent of Green Power, the Huayang Companies will not engage in any transactions that could materially affect their respective assets, liabilities, rights or operations, including, without limitation, incurrence or assumption of any indebtedness, sale or purchase of any assets or rights, incurrence of any encumbrance on any of their assets or intellectual property rights in favor of a third party or transfer of any agreements relating to their business operation to any third party.

Green Power or its designated person has sole discretion to decide when to exercise the option, whether in part or in full. The term of this agreement, as amended, is 20 years from October 12, 2007 and may be extended prior to its expiration by written agreement of the parties.
 
Our Dyeing and Finishing Business
 
Historically, our primary operations involved the design, manufacture and distribution of a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry. Our products feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are used in dyeing yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. We are continuing to seek to utilize our expertise in manufacturing precision products to meet demand in new and existing end markets.
 
The textile industry in China has been facing significant headwinds recently. Difficult economic conditions, a continuing decline in oil prices and limited availability of credit in China, presented numerous challenges for our dyeing machine business. Additionally, apparel factories and other factories have been shut down throughout the last year by China’s environmental bureau, which has been cutting electricity and gas supply to determine compliance with China’s environmental laws. In the past year, reports estimate that China has dispatched inspectors in as many as 30 provinces around the country and 80,000 factories—roughly 40 percent of the factories in China—have been fined, charged or closed because of their emissions. This has caused softer demand for our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many of our potential customers have already upgraded to new models and the remaining potential customer base does not have the ability to make significant capital expenditures at this time. As a result, if we are to sell our products to the smaller textile manufacturers, it may be necessary for us to design and market a cheaper machine that meets the Chinese government requirements or reduce prices which would impact both revenues and gross margin.

We design, manufacture and distribute a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery. We believe that we are one of the leading domestic Chinese manufacturers of textile dyeing machines, and our Huayang brand is nationally recognized. We currently have the capacity to manufacture and assemble approximately 600 textile-dyeing machines annually. Our state-of-the-art and automated production line enables us to manufacture our products efficiently, with lower labor and energy costs compared to traditional manufacturing methods. As part of our manufacturing process, we make corrosion-resistant stainless steel pumps and pressure vessels, which are not only critical components for our dyeing and finishing products but have other industrial applications as well.
 
In 1999, we received the “Advanced Enterprise for Progress in Science and Technology Award” from Wuxi City and the “Star of Brilliance Medal” from the Wuxi City Bureau of Industrial and Commercial Administration. In 2002, we were recognized as an “Advanced Enterprise for Technical Reform Input” by Qianzhou, a municipality within Wuxi City for our dyeing products.
 
We hold 33 Chinese patents, of which eight are described under “Intellectual Property Rights.” These patents cover an innovative production technique enabling more-effective cloth washing in dyeing machines under high temperature and pressure, the dyeing liquid mixing device, dyeing liquid atomizing device, horizontal manipulated devices, mechanical seal and atomizer of its airflow dyeing machine and cover components of the hot air circulation system of low emission air flow dyeing machines.
 
Our dyeing and finishing products are generally compact in design compared with alternatives on the market and feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are used in dyeing a wide variety of yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. In 2010, we introduced an advanced dyeing technology enabling a quick, economic and environment-friendly operation designed for optimal performance. The liquid pressure and quantity are adjusted to the respective type and quantity of fabric. The special layout of the pressure pump circuit is designed to provide constant and safe operations of the machine reducing resources wastage and enhancing performance.
 
We developed a high (low) temperature airflow dyeing machine. We believe that this new model of dyeing machine is efficient and cost effective and meets the requisite Chinese environmental standards. In September 2014, we received two Chinese patents which cover components of the hot air circulation system of our low emission air flow dyeing machines. We believe that the hot air circulation system helps to enhance the machines’ ability to produce higher quality textiles with a better look and feel.
 
We have developed a new air-fluid, dual-use dyeing machine which uses both air flow and fluid flow in the dyeing process. It allows users to customize the dyeing process according to the specific type of textile. It is equipped with a series of specialized and patented components, including nozzles, cloth wheels and cloth spreaders, which are designed to permit greater color evenness and reduce defects. It can be used on a wider range of textiles and uses 60% to 70% less water, about 30% less power and 40% to 50% less steam than traditional models of high-temperature, high-pressure dyeing machines and reduces the use of additives by about 50% while shortening dyeing time by one to two hours.
 
In August 2016, we purchased a patent technology use right for a ten-year term from a third party. The patent covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment. We believe this patent technology will allow us to develop next generation dyeing and finishing equipment that will appeal to textile manufacturers in China as well as Southeastern Asia, particularly Vietnam and Bangladesh. We have developed a few prototypes based on this patent technology and have begun taking orders in small quantities.
 
Our Sharing Economy Business
 
Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, we established new business divisions to focus on the development of sharing economy platforms and related rental businesses. We believe a true peer-to-peer sharing economy based on rentals will take significant market share in both the business and consumer markets over the next few years. 
 
Sharing economy business models are hosted through digital platforms that enable more precise, real-time measurement of spare capacity and have the ability to dynamically connect that capacity with those who need it. These digital platforms handle transactions that offer access over ownership through renting, lending, subscribing, reselling, swapping or donating. Consumers who use sharing economy business models are often more comfortable with transactions that involve deeper social interactions than traditional methods of exchange.
 
We have been exploring possible merger and acquisition opportunities that can bring to market more user-friendly platforms and convenient channels that allow people to rent what they need and make their lives easier. We are currently emphasizing the following areas:
 
On Demand Services
 
The ways people work and how services are provided has been changing, and there is a growing need for short-term services and workforces in the market. In December 2017, we acquired a 51% interest in Inspirit Studio Limited, which is engaged in developing a mobile app platform which provides instant errand services in a peer to peer model. BuddiGo, is our new sharing platform that allows users to outsource daily chores and mundane tasks to “Buddies” who can spare idle time to run errands. According to iimediaResearch, the number of users participating in the peer-to-peer delivery sharing market in China has grown from 124 million in 2014 to 231 million in 2016, and experts expect it to grow to 353 million by the end of 2018. We expect to launch this service in mid-2018. We are also exploring other on-demand and referral recruitment services.

Coworking and Coliving Development
 
According to Small Business Labs, the number of coworking spaces globally will exceed 30,000 by 2022, with over 5.1 million people utilizing coworking spaces. We are entering this market through partnerships and affiliations with current coworking and coliving space operators, including our recent acquisition of Anyworkspace.com, an online, real-time marketplace that connects workspace providers with clients who need temporary office and meeting spaces. We are seeking additional alliances with other operators in the near future. Furthermore, the development of our item rental services within our EC Power subsidiary, will also support our coworking and coliving rental community development.
Technology Development
 
In January 2018, we acquired a 60% interest in 3D Discovery, an IT service provider that develops virtual tours for the real estate, hospitality and interior design industries. 3D Discovery’s space capturing and modeling technology is already used by some of Hong Kong's leading property agencies to provide their clients with a truly immersive, first-hand experience of a physical space while saving them time and money. According to Goldman Sachs, the Real Estate virtual reality ("VR") industry is predicted to reach US$2.6 billion in 2025, supported by a potential user base of over 1.4 million registered real estate agents in some of the world's largest markets. Apart from its existing profitable operations, 3D Discovery is developing a mobile app which allows users to create an interactive virtual tour of a physical space by using a mobile phone camera.
 
We have established both in-house engineering teams and engaged with external technology partners and advisors to develop a common underlying information and transaction platform which can be used by different sharing economy vertical applications. Our technical teams and partners include experts in blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, digital imaging and video technologies, eCommerce and UI/UX, among others. We are working with our partners to develop SEII’s “Sharing Blocks,” a blockchain-based platform which provides functions for secured user profile information and transaction records through a “Blockchain as a Service” (BaaS) model, allowing third-party sharing economy applications to utilize and build a global consolidated and trustworthy sharing economy ecosystem.
 
In August 2017, we signed an agreement with ECoin Global Limited ("ECoin") for the future purchase of ECoin redemption codes with an aggregate value of $50 million for total consideration of $20 million. We plan to resell the redemption codes in the form of ECrent gift cards at global locales through reseller channels, such as convenience stores. We are working with InComm, a global pre-payment network and solution provider, to sell the redemption codes with face values of HK$100, HK$300 and HK$500 at major convenience store networks in Hong Kong and Macau with other international locations to follow.
 
Sharing Communities
 
Because the sharing economy is predicated on the trust of all participants, we believe the best way to establish sharing behaviors is within communities. We are currently engaged in exclusive discussions with ECrent Capital Holdings Limited ("ECrent"), a private company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands focused on developing and operating a global rental platform to promote sharing economy across 30 countries and regions.
Solar Farm Joint Venture
 
On December 26, 2016, Dyeing and Xue Miao, an unrelated individual, formed Shengxin, in which Dyeing has a 30% equity interest and Mr. Xue holds a 70% interest, pursuant to an agreement dated December 23, 2016. The agreement sets forth general terms relating to the proposed business, but does not set forth specific funding obligations for either party. Dyeing has agreed to invest RMB 60,000,000 (approximately $9,200,000) and had invested RMB 59.8 million ($9,189,397 at December 31, 2017, for which it received a 30% interest, and Mr. Xue has a commitment to invest RMB 140,000,000 (approximately $21.5 million), of which Mr. Xue has contributed RMB 60,000,000 (approximately $9.2 million), for which Mr. Xue received a 70% interest in Shengxin. Shengxin’s registered capital is RMB 200 million (approximately $30.7 million). Mr. Xue has advised Dyeing that he anticipates that he will fund the remaining RMB 80,000,000 (approximately $12.2 million) of his commitment during 2018. Since Mr. Xue did not make this payment by the end of 2017, Dyeing has the right to amend the contract, and both parties may adjust each side’s equity interest to reflect the amount of capital each side has actually invested. As of December 31, 2017, no changes have been made to such contract.

Shengxin intends to develop, construct and maintain photovoltaic power generation projects, known as solar farms, in China, mainly in the provinces of GuiZhou and YunNan. During 2017, Shengxin has located a number of projects and also has discussions with various local government entities and incurred minor expenses in 2017 including due diligence expenses land survey expenses, and other miscellaneous expenses related to these potential projects. However, given the decrease in the Chinese government subsidies for utility scale solar projects in 2017 as well as the high cost of solar components, Shengxin was has not been able to locate any project which it believes could yield an expected leveraged internal rate of return of higher than 12%. Accordingly, Shengxin has not invested into any solar projects. There are no provisions for additional projects, and we cannot assure you that we would participate in any projects beyond the scope of the present agreement with Mr. Xue.
 
During the project construction period, we will have the priority to supply components and equipment such as: solar racking and mounting systems for the projects under the same conditions as the other vendors. However, we cannot assure you that we can develop a competitive product at a competitive price.
 
The solar farm industry is China is subject to significant government regulation. In order to construct and operate solar farms in China, it is necessary to obtain a permit for a specific location, to obtain leasehold rights to a significant amount of contiguous land parcels in provinces where there is sufficient sunlight for most of the year to support a solar farm and to have an agreement to connect with the local grid. The development of solar farms requires significant funding, which, if financing is not available, would have to be provided by Dyeing and Mr. Xue. There are no agreements relating to the funding obligations of either Dyeing or Mr. Xue with respect to any specific project. Shengxin anticipates that to the extent that it obtains permits for solar farms, it will form a new subsidiary for the sole purpose of obtaining the permit for a specific location and constructing the solar farm at that location. The nature of the parties’ respective investments and the respective equity interest in any solar farm project will be determined on a case-by-case basis. To the extent that Mr. Xue develops the project, he may receive an equity interest in the project greater than the percentage of his equity investment, with the specific amount being subject to mutual agreement of the parties.
 
Our investment in Shengxin is subject to a high degree of risk. We cannot give any assurance that Shengxin will be able to obtain any permits, raise any required funding, develop and operate or sell any solar farms or operate profitably or that Dyeing will have the resources to provide any funds that may be required in order to fund any solar farm projects for which Shengxin may obtain permits. There may be a significant delay between the time funds are advanced for any project and the realization of revenue or cash flow from any project.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
Substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of textile dyeing and finishing machines in China. We presently sell our products in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, both regions with significant textile production, as well as in many of the coastal regions of China such as Shandong and Guangdong provinces.
 
We market and sell our products through our internal sales force, which is based in our facilities in Wuxi. Our marketing programs include industrial conferences, trade fairs, sales training and advertising. Our sales and marketing groups work closely with our manufacturing groups to coordinate our product development activities, product launches and ongoing demand and supply planning. We sell our products directly to many of China’s largest textile producers. However, as the large textile producers purchase equipment that complies with the Chinese regulations, they have less of a need for new equipment and many of the smaller textile producers do not have the available funding or credit facilities to enable them to purchase capital equipment such as our dyeing and finishing equipment.
 
Our sharing economy businesses are still in a very early stage of development. We intend to market and sell our services for these businesses primarily through online media advertising. Online marketing consists of search engine marketing, display advertisements, referral programs and affiliate marketing. We have established a business unit, EC Advertising Limited, to support these endeavors. EC Advertising will provide resources to support the marketing needs of the sharing economy businesses via partnerships and acquisitions of advertising companies.
 
Growth Strategies
 
According to China’s National Development and Reform Commission, the main focus of the country’s textile industry has shifted from gaining competitive advantages based on labor costs toward the objectives of developing scientific and technological innovation as well as brand creation.
 
In support of this objective, we are continuing our efforts to develop and implement next-generation low energy consumption and high heating efficiency features to our machines. The current emphasis of our efforts continues to be on increasing automation features in our existing products and implementing power line communication technology throughout our production facilities to enable our customers to reduce their use of electricity and water. However, we experienced softer demand for our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many of our customers already upgraded to newer models and much of our remaining customer base does not have the ability to make significant capital expenditures at this time. As a result, our sales in this segment declined from $17.4 million in 2016 to $13.5 million in 2017, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase our sales to his market.

Given the headwinds affecting our manufacturing business, we have made the decision to focus on high growth opportunities and have added new sharing economy business units into the group. Our latest business initiatives are focused on targeting the technology and global sharing economy markets, by developing online platforms and rental business partnerships that will drive the global development of sharing through economical rental business models.
 
Today, the sharing economy is in the process of disrupting and transforming numerous industries, changing both business and consumer behavior. The sharing economy redefines how resources are being provided and utilizes them in a more efficient way. According to Juniper Research, total sharing economy revenue is predicted to reach $40.2 billion by 2022. PwC UK forecasts the five most prominent sharing economy sectors – collaborative finance, peer-to-peer accommodation, peer-to-peer transportation, on-demand household services and on-demand professional services, could see a 20-fold increase to €570 billion by 2025 in European markets, up from just €28 billion today. The sharing economy is spreading across different industries and regions, creating new market behavior.
 
In 2017, we began studying and acquiring sharing economy platforms in different market disciplines. Following these efforts, we are now grouping our sharing economy markets in the following verticals: coworking and coliving communities, community consumer resource sharing, collaborative transportation, on-demand peer-to-peer services, and social referral recruitment.
 
We believe further mergers and acquisitions have the potential to grow the Company rapidly and aggressively in new market opportunities, technology, products and platforms. We will continue targeting the technology and global sharing economy markets, by developing online platforms and rental business partnerships that will drive the global development of sharing through economical rental business models.
 
Competition
 
Because of the importance of the Chinese textile industry in the world market, our dyeing and finishing business faces competition from both domestic and foreign suppliers. However, we believe that, due to the high quality of our products, our principal competition is from suppliers based in foreign countries, including Japan, Germany, Italy and France. Domestically, our chief competitor is Fong’s National Engineering (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Fong’s Industries Company Ltd., a Hong-Kong based conglomerate.
 
We believe that we can effectively compete with these companies on the basis of the quality and performance of our products, our after-sales service, and cost. We provide one year of maintenance and repair services for all of our products and based on historical experience, maintenance and repair service calls have been minimal. Moreover, we provide customers in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, our top markets, with on-site support which is generally provided within 24 hours of receiving a request. However, many of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial or technological resources than we do and presently enjoy greater brand recognition.
 
However, in trying to market our equipment to smaller textile companies, competition may be based more on price than quality, and we may not be able to price competitively without seriously eroding our margins. It may be necessary for us to develop lower price machinery to meet the price needs of the smaller textile manufacturers.
 
Further, as Chinese textile companies face competition from countries with a lower labor cost, the Chinese market for our equipment may decrease and we may not be able to market successfully to textile manufacturers in other countries.
 
The global sharing economy continues to evolve, and we face competition from technology companies, both large and small, throughout the world. The Company aims to become a pioneer in the development of sharing economy solutions. The group is developing different sharing economy applications with a common user and transaction processing engine, which will become a sharing economy ecosystem for the convenience of users as well as allowing the group to effectively share technologies and business data. Our different sharing economy solutions will have the ability to collaborate with each other, allowing us to provide one-stop combined solutions to the market. We believe the ability to leverage and collaborate between our different sharing businesses will increase our market competitiveness.
 
Source of Supply
 
In our dyeing and finishing business, stainless steel and other metals are the principal raw material for the manufacture of all of our products. We purchase stainless steel tubes from Wuxi City Zhongtian Stainless Steel Co., Ltd. and stainless steel plates from Wuxi City Fanshun Materials Co., Ltd. While we do not have long-term contracts with these suppliers, we have long-term business relationship with them, and these companies have generally met our supply requirements. For the textile machinery business, the price of steel can have more significant impact. Any significant rise in the price of or demand for stainless steel could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Inflation has recently affected raw materials generally, and inflationary pressures could have a significant effect on our business. Other raw materials, such as stainless steel planks and transducers, are readily available from a number of suppliers on commercially reasonable terms.

In our sharing economy business, IT development resources are crucial for the near-term development of our sharing platforms. We are in the process of signing fixed man-day service contracts with our external development consultants to ensure the availability of IT development resources under a fixed pricing scheme for the near future. We will continue to expand our IT development support resources cross regionally to avoid the dependency on a single or small number of sources.
 
Research and Development
 
In our dyeing and finishing business, we incurred research and development expense in the amount of $420,000 and $304,000 related to the development and improvement of our new dyeing machinery in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We are continuing product development with respect to the new dyeing machinery. 
 
In our sharing economy business, we have established both in-house engineering teams and engaged with external technology partners and advisors to develop a common underlying information and transaction platform which can be used by different sharing economy vertical applications. Our technical teams and partners include experts in blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, digital imaging and video technologies, eCommerce and UI/UX, among others. Given the early stage of the sharing economy business, we did not incur any R&D expenses in 2017. We expect this to increase in 2018 as we work on building this business and the associated IT and transaction platforms.
 
Government Regulations
 
Environmental Regulations
 
Our manufacturing processes generate noise, waste water, gaseous and other industrial wastes, and we use, generate and discharge toxic, volatile and otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes in our operations. As a result, we are required to comply with all national and local regulations regarding protection of the environment. Our operations are subject to regulations promulgated by China’s Environmental Protection Administration, Jiangsu Province Environmental Protection Administration and the Wuxi City Environmental Administration. We are also subject to periodic monitoring by local environmental protection authorities in Wuxi. We have installed various types of anti-pollution equipment in our facilities to reduce, treat, and, where feasible, recycle the wastes generated in our manufacturing processes. We believe that our manufacturing facilities and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Based on the requirement of present law, we do not expect that any additional measures that may be required to maintain compliance will materially affect our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.
 
The Chinese government has expressed a concern about pollution and other environmental hazards. Although we believe that we comply with current national and local government regulations, if it is determined that we are in violation of these regulations, we can be subject to financial penalties as well as the loss of our business license, in which event we would be unable to continue in business. Further, if the national or local government adopts more stringent regulations, we may incur significant costs in complying with such regulations. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental regulations, we may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend production or cease operations. Any failure by us to control the use of or to restrict adequately the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspensions in our business operations.
 
Our products must also comply with applicable environmental regulations, and we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations applicable to our products.


Business Licenses
 
Dyeing has been issued a business license with the appropriate municipal and provincial government which specifically authorizes it to operate its business. The business license, which is subject to annual review by the issuing agency, is current as of the date of this annual report. No additional approval or license is required for the manufacturing and sale of the textile dyeing and finishing machines. 
 
We believe our sharing economy businesses are properly licensed with the appropriate government entities. However, because BuddiGo’s business model provides inner-city peer-to-peer delivery services, we could be identified as a member of the logistics industry by the governments of some countries where we conduct business. This could trigger additional licensing requirements.

ISO Certification
 
Our dyeing and finishing business received the certificate to manufacture D1 and D2 levels of pressure vessels, which includes our current line of dyeing machines, from the Quality and Technical Supervision Bureau of Jiangsu Province. We received the certificate on December 7, 2007 and renewed it on December 21, 2015. This certificate expires on December 20, 2019.
 
Circular 106 Compliance and Approval
 
On May 31, 2007, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, issued an official notice known as “Circular 106,” which requires the owners of any Chinese companies to obtain SAFE’s approval before establishing any offshore holding company structure for foreign financing as well as subsequent acquisition matters in China. Accordingly, in early September 2007, the owners of 100% of the equity in the Huayang Companies, namely Jianhua Wu and his wife, Lihua Tang, submitted their application to SAFE. On October 11, 2007, SAFE approved their application, permitting them to establish an offshore company, Fulland, as a “special purpose vehicle” for any foreign ownership and capital raising activities by the Huayang Companies. After SAFE’s approval, Mr. Wu and Ms. Tang became the majority owners of Fulland on October 11, 2007. Fulland was acquired by us in November 2007.
Draft Foreign Investment Law
 
On January 19, 2015, the Ministry of Commerce of China (“MOFCOM”) published a draft version of a proposed Foreign Investment Law with an explanatory note. The draft Foreign Investment Law, if and when promulgated, will replace and integrate the three existing laws over foreign investment, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and the Sino-foreign Cooperative Enterprise Law. The draft Foreign Investment Law was formulated with a view to opening wider to the outside, promoting and regulating foreign investment, protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors, safeguarding national security and public interests, and facilitating the healthy development of the socialist market economy. MOFCOM has requested comments from the public on the draft Law by February 17, 2015.
 
Some of the more significant concepts in the draft Foreign Investment Law include the following:
 
Actual Control
 
The proposed law has adopted the concept of actual control in the foreign investment area. The draft Foreign Investment Law notes that a company established in China but controlled by foreign investors shall be deemed a foreign investor while entities set up in foreign jurisdictions but controlled by Chinese investors can, in some circumstances, be deemed Chinese domestic investors. According to the draft Foreign Investment Law, “control” refers to several circumstances including the contractual control by imposing decisive influences on the operation, finance, personnel or technology of the enterprise by contract, trust or other means.
Special Administrative Measures
 
Most foreign investments will not need pre-approval as was previously required. It means that the Chinese market could be more open and efficient in some sectors to set up foreign invested companies. However, the draft Foreign Investment Law sets out a catalogue of special administrative measures, which is classified into a catalogue of prohibitions and a catalogue of restrictions. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in any sector set out in the catalogue of prohibitions. Further, a catalogue of restrictions will note those sectors with restrictions imposed on foreign investors. The use of catalogue of special administrative measures represents a method of management or administration of foreign investments.
 
How domestic VIEs, potentially deemed to be foreign enterprises under the draft Foreign Investment Law and currently operating in sectors in the catalogue of prohibitions, will be treated is unclear.
 
National Security Reviews
 
The draft Foreign Investment Law also establishes a united foreign investment national security review system which will conduct examinations on the foreign investments that endangers or may endanger the national security.
Information Reporting System
 
The draft Foreign Investment Law establishes a foreign investment information reporting system. The new rules include submission of a foreign investment report (such as when setting up a company), a report of any changes of foreign investment (any adjustments of investment) and an annual report. Generally, reporting obligations arise when a foreign investor purchases not less than 10% of the stock of a domestic listed company, or less than 10% but the purchase results in a change of control of the domestic listed company.

Supervision and Inspection
 
The draft Foreign Investment Law establishes a mechanism for the supervision and inspection of foreign investors and foreign invested enterprises from industrial and commercial, taxation, foreign exchange, auditing and other administrative departments. The government’s eye on foreign investments and foreign investment management has shifted from the approval prior to a foreign invested company being established to the supervision and inspection after it is set up.
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection laws in China and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and our brand. In addition to 24 other patents held by us, the eight Chinese patents, all of which relate to our dyeing products, are our principal patents. The patents were issued by the State Intellectual Property Office of the People’s Republic of China in November 2012, as to the first patent, and June 2013 as to the other five and September 2014 as to the last two.
 
The following table sets forth information concerning our eight principal patents.

ZL 2013 1 0004736.1 | hot air circulation system of air flow dyeing machines | September 2034 

 
In August 2016, we purchased a patent technology use right for a ten-year term from a third party. The patent covers ozone-ultrasonic textile dyeing equipment.
 
We intend to apply for more patents to protect our core technologies. We also have confidentiality and non-competition policies in place as part of our company employment guideline which is given to each employee, and we enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.
