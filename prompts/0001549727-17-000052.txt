 Item 1.  Business
   This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled Risk Factors, that may cause our or our industrys actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.   Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.   Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.    unless the context requires or is otherwise indicated, the terms we, us, our, the Registrant, the Company, our company only refer to Taxus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., a New York corporation, incorporated on January 02, 2002. Taxus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc.s former name is Little Neck Health Connection Inc and we still carry out business as Little Neck Health Connection Inc.  The Company was formed under the name of Little Neck Health Connection Inc in the state of New York on January 2, 2002. The Company is operating a retail store, located in Little Neck, New York, selling dietary supplement products such as vitamins, minerals, calcium, fibers, and proteins, etc.  On September 22, 2014, the Company filed the amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to change its name to Taxus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. and increased the number of authorized shares to 1,5000,000,000 and changed the par of each share to each share to $0.00001. The Company sold 80,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share on March 31, 2015 and sold 1,500,000 shares at $0.001 per share on October 14, 2014.  The Company filed a registration statement on form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration and resale of 1,500,000 shares at $0.10 per share. The proceeds from the sale of these shares will go to the selling shareholders. The Company will receive no proceeds.  Plan of Operation
  The Company plans to open more retail stores in the Borough of Queens, New York City, New York. The new stores will be selling the same dietary supplement products that the current store is selling, including vitamins, minerals, and proteins. In order to open new stores, the Company needs to find new locations appropriate for dietary supplement stores, negotiate leases with the potential landlords, hire additional managers to operate the new stores, and purchase more merchandise for the new stores inventory. So far the Company is still searching for a suitable new location. The Company has not been able to develop a time frame on when it will find the suitable new location. Besides, the Company has not made any plan to raise the funds necessary to expand the operations. Therefore, there is the possibility that the Company may not be able to open any new stores or at all if the Company cannot find the suitable new locations and cannot raise the necessary funds for the business expansion.   Products and Services
  We are a retail store that sells dietary supplement products such as vitamins, minerals, calcium, fibers, and proteins, etc.   4     Customers and Sales
  As a retail store, our customers are the individual shoppers. We dont rely on any particular customer. We do not derive any sales from mail order and internet sales.  Suppliers
  Our main suppliers are dietary supplement products wholesalers. There is not any material supplier other than dietary supplement products wholesalers.  We purchase merchandise from a number of wholesalers. We do not rely on any particular supplier.  Our Competitors
  The dietary supplements retail market in the U.S is highly competitive and fragmented. As a small retail store, our market share is very small and insignificant. There are thousands of stores national wide that are much larger than us.  According to our own internal research, the dietary supplement industry is very competitive and highly fragmented. Our Company will need to compete against many other companies. Bigger companies and established companies with more recognition in the market have more funds to invest for promotion and marketing. These competitors may be able to attract and retain a larger number of talents, which would negatively affect our business. Included in the dietary supplements retail industry in the United States are drugstores, specialty retailers, multi-level marketing companies, supermarkets, on-line entities, mass merchandisers, and a variety of other smaller participants. We compete for sales with all these participants. We compete for customers and revenue primarily on the basis of store location, merchandise selection, and services. We believe that the continued consolidation of the drugstore industry and continued new store openings by chain store operators will further increase competitive pressures in the industry. In addition, some of our larger competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater financial and other resources; larger variety of products; more extensive and advanced supply chain management systems; greater pricing flexibility; larger economies of scale and purchasing power; more extensive advertising and marketing efforts; greater knowledge of local market conditions; stronger brand recognition; and larger sales and distribution networks. As a result, we may be unable to offer products more desirable than those offered by our competitors, market our products as effectively as our competitors or otherwise respond successfully to competitive pressures. In addition, our competitors may be able to offer larger discounts on competing products, and we may not be able to profitably match those discounts. Furthermore, our competitors may offer products that are more attractive to our customers or that render our products uncompetitive. In addition, the timing of the introduction of competing products into the market could affect the market acceptance and market share of our products. Our failure to compete successfully could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects.  Research and Development
