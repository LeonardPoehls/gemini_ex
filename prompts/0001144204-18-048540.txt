Overview
 
On December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our content delivery and storage business (the “Content Delivery business”) and other related assets to Vecima Networks, Inc. (“Vecima”) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of October 13, 2017 (the “CDN APA”) between the Company and Vecima. Substantially all assets and liabilities associated with the Content Delivery business were assigned to Vecima as part of the transaction. The Content Delivery business provided advanced applications focused on storing, protecting, transforming, and delivering high value media assets and served industries and customers that demand uncompromising performance, reliability and flexibility to gain a competitive edge, drive meaningful growth and confidently deliver best-in-class solutions that enrich the lives of millions of people around the world every day. The Content Delivery business consisted of (1) software, hardware and services for intelligently streaming video content to a variety of consumer devices and storing and managing content in the network and (2) Aquari™ Storage, a unified scale-out storage solutions product that is ideally suited for a wide range of enterprise IT and video applications. Results of our Content Delivery business are retrospectively reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Unless otherwise noted, discussion of our business and results of operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing operations.
 
In May 2017, we sold our Real-Time business consisting of real-time Linux operating system versions, development and performance optimization tools, simulation software and other system software combined to Real-Time, Inc. (the “RT Purchaser”) pursuant to an Asset and Share Purchase Agreement (the “RT APA”). These real-time products were sold to a wide variety of companies seeking high performance, real-time computer solutions in the defense, aerospace, financial and automotive markets around the world. Results of our Real-Time business are retrospectively reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Unless otherwise noted, discussion of our business and results of operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing operations.
 
A special committee of the Board, the Investment Committee, was established upon the signing of the CDN APA for the purpose of considering alternative means to deploy the proceeds of the sale of the Content Delivery business and other corporate assets to maximize long-term value for our stockholders. Such alternatives include, but are not limited to, evaluating opportunities to acquire all or a controlling interest in one or more operating businesses or assets intended to provide attractive returns for our stockholders and that are intended to result in appreciation in value, a more liquid trading market for our stock, and enhance our ability to utilize our existing U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”). Other than the restrictions set forth in the relevant non-competition and non-solicitation agreement executed by the Company in connection with the disposition of our prior operations, there are no restrictions on the transactions that we can pursue, including with respect to industry sector and geographic location.
 
We are actively pursuing business opportunities, including the acquisition of new businesses or assets, as well as developing and managing our current business and assets. We continually identify and evaluate a wide range of opportunities in an effort to reinvest the proceeds of our 2017 business dispositions and maximize use of other assets such as our NOLs. We believe that these activities will enable us to identify, acquire and grow businesses and assets that will maximize value for all of our stockholders.
 
As part of this effort, our senior management spends a significant portion of its time evaluating potential acquisition and strategic opportunities. We have received referrals with respect to and have performed due diligence assessments on multiple target companies and strategic opportunities in a variety of industries.  We work with several financial advisors and consultants on a non-exclusive basis and have been able to filter leads and referrals through diverse channels enabling us to review a wide range of opportunities in a variety of industries. We have not focused our acquisition and strategic efforts on any specific industry, focusing instead on identifying well-priced businesses and assets that we believe have significant growth potential.
 
Our acquisition process is focused on identifying fairly- to under-valued businesses that have growth potential. Due to current market conditions, we have faced significant competition from strategic and, in particular, financial buyers which in many instances have raised seller valuation expectations above what we consider to be attractive levels for us and our stockholders. We continue to believe that fairly- and under-valued opportunities exist and are attainable and do not intend to pursue what we consider to be overvalued businesses and assets that we believe may not deliver the levels of returns that we target.

In addition to its pursuit of acquisition opportunities the Investment Committee is tasked with creating operating activities and businesses that will enhance stockholder value. To that end, during fiscal year 2018, the Company began developing a real estate operation initially through making a number of commercial loans secured by real property. Based on the success of these activities, including the yield characteristics of these loans, and management’s experience in the real estate area, the Company recently created Recur Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company wholly owned by the Company, through which the Company will hold and manage its existing and future real estate operations. At this time the Company does not expect any significant increase in expenses for its real estate operations as its existing management team has significant experience in this sector and believes they can manage the business without adding additional staffing resources. As these operations grow, we plan to leverage our contacts and potential strategic partnerships to help source continued opportunities for this business. As a part of its real estate operations, the Company plans to continue to assess opportunities to create value through real property ownership, financing and/or development, among other strategies. The Company intends to continue to build on its current operations through its newly formed subsidiary while it continues to evaluate acquisition and strategic opportunities (inside or outside the real estate sector).
