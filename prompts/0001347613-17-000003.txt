ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Unless the context requires otherwise, the words “Synergy,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” refer to Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. and, where appropriate, our subsidiaries. TRULANCE™ is a trademark of Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. Any other trademarks reference in this Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners. All rights reserved.
Business Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel gastrointestinal (GI) therapies. We have pioneered discovery, research and development efforts around analogs of uroguanylin, a naturally occurring and endogenous human GI peptide, for the treatment of GI diseases and disorders. We discovered, are developing and control 100% worldwide rights to our proprietary uroguanylin analog platform.
Our first and only commercial product, plecanatide, is approved in the United States (U.S.), under the trademark name TRULANCE™, for the treatment of adults with chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved TRULANCE on January 19, 2017. The recommended adult dosage of TRULANCE is 3 mg taken orally, once daily, with or without food. TRULANCE will be available in the U.S. the first quarter of 2017. In addition, we are developing TRULANCE for the treatment of adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and plan to file a new drug application supplement with clinical data (sNDA) for TRULANCE in IBS-C in the first quarter of 2017. We are also exploring opioid-induced constipation (OIC) as a potential lifecycle growth opportunity for TRULANCE.
Dolcanatide, our second product candidate, is being evaluated for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In January 2016, we announced positive proof-of-concept with dolcanatide in a phase 1b trial evaluating 28 patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. We plan to meet with regulatory agencies to discuss next steps in development for dolcanatide in mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. In November 2014, we reported successful proof-of-concept with dolcanatide in a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in 289 patients with OIC, demonstrating the utility of our uroguanylin analog platform in OIC.

 Uroguanylin Analog Platform
CIC and IBS-C
CIC and IBS-C are chronic, functional GI disorders that afflict millions of people worldwide. An estimated 33 million adults suffer from CIC and 12 million adults suffer from IBS-C in the U.S. alone. 
People with CIC have persistent symptoms of difficult-to-pass and infrequent bowel movements. In addition to physical symptoms including abdominal bloating and discomfort, CIC can adversely affect an individual’s quality of life, including increasing stress levels and anxiety. Many patients attempt to manage CIC symptoms with improved diet, fiber, and over-the-counter laxatives; however, these options can be ineffective or may not provide long-term relief. For those patients with persistent symptoms, prescription therapy is recommended. Many patients taking prescription medications fail to respond to therapy, or suffer from treatment-related adverse events, such as nausea and diarrhea.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with 2 or more of the following criteria: related to defecation, associated with a change in the frequency of stool, or associated with a change in the form (appearance) of the stool. IBS can be subtyped by the predominant stool form as measured by the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS): constipation (IBS-C), diarrhea (IBS-D), or mixed (IBS-M). Those within the IBS-C subtype experience Bristol types 1 or 2 (hard or lumpy) stools more than 25 percent of the time they have an abnormal bowel movement, and Bristol types 6 or 7 (loose or watery) stools less than 25 percent of the time they have an abnormal bowel movement. Some of the IBS treatment approaches recognized by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), including specialized diets, fiber, and psychological interventions, may not always effectively address abdominal pain and discomfort experienced by these patients. While there are prescription drug options, not all patients find complete relief, and many struggle with adverse events. 
TRULANCE 
TRULANCE is the first drug designed to replicate the function of uroguanylin. Uroguanylin, a guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) receptor agonist, is thought to work in a pH-sensitive manner primarily in the small intestine to stimulate fluid secretion. Uroguanylin stimulates fluid secretion into the lumen of the intestinal tract and maintains stool consistency that is necessary for normal bowel function. With the exception of a single amino acid, TRULANCE is structurally identical to uroguanylin and is the only treatment that is thought to replicate the pH-sensitive activity of human uroguanylin. The single amino acid substitution results in improved (8x) binding affinity and therefore increases the potency of TRULANCE over uroguanylin. 
TRULANCE for CIC
The FDA has approved TRULANCE for the treatment of adults with CIC. The efficacy and safety of TRULANCE was evaluated in the largest Phase 3 CIC clinical trials to date, which included more than 2,600 patients in two randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of TRULANCE.
Over 12 weeks, patients treated with TRULANCE achieved a significantly greater efficacy responder rate — the primary endpoint defined by the FDA for regulatory approval in CIC — in both studies compared to placebo (Study 1: 21% vs. 10%; Study 2: 21% vs. 13%, p<0.005 for both studies). Efficacy responders were defined as patients who had at least three complete 
4

spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) in a given week and an increase of at least one CSBM over baseline in the same week for at least nine weeks out of the 12-week period, including at least three of the last four weeks.
Over 12 weeks, patients who received TRULANCE in both studies also had improvements as compared to placebo in stool frequency (as measured by the number of spontaneous bowel movements per week), stool consistency (as measured by the Bristol Stool Form Scale) and straining with bowel movements.
In an integrated analysis of both studies, diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction, reported in 5% of patients treated with TRULANCE compared to 1% of patients treated with placebo. Overall discontinuation rates were low among patients treated with TRULANCE and placebo (4% vs. 2%, respectively) and the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was diarrhea (2% for TRULANCE compared to 0.5% in placebo).
The recommended adult dosage of TRULANCE is 3 mg taken orally, once daily, with or without food. TRULANCE can be swallowed whole or crushed in applesauce for those who are unable to swallow medication.
TRULANCE will be available in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2017.
TRULANCE for IBS-C
On December 9, 2016, we announced top-line results from the first of two pivotal phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of TRULANCE in 1,135 adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). Preliminary analysis of the data indicates that both TRULANCE 3 mg and 6 mg doses met the study's primary endpoint showing statistical significance in the percentage of patients who were Overall Responders compared to placebo during the 12-week treatment period (21.5% in 3 mg and 24.0% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 14.2% in placebo; p=0.009 for 3 mg and p<0.001 for 6 mg). 
The most common adverse event was diarrhea which occurred in 3.2% of patients in 3 mg and 3.7% of patients in 6 mg dose groups compared to 1.3% of placebo-treated patients. Four patients in the trial (0.4%) experienced serious adverse events but there was no imbalance across treatment groups in either incidences or individual serious adverse events. Overall, the rates of withdrawal from treatment because of an adverse event were low (1.9% in 3 mg and 1.8% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0 in placebo) and discontinuations due to diarrhea were infrequent (0.8% in 3 mg and 1.6% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0 in placebo).
On December 22, 2016, we announced top-line results from the second of two pivotal phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of TRULANCE in 1,054 adult patients with IBS-C. Preliminary analysis of the data indicates that both TRULANCE 3 mg and 6 mg doses met the study's primary endpoint showing statistical significance in the percentage of patients who were Overall Responders compared to placebo during the 12-week treatment period (30.2% in 3 mg and 29.5% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 17.8% in placebo; p<0.001 for 3 mg and p<0.001 for 6 mg). 
The most common adverse event was diarrhea which occurred in 5.4% of patients in 3 mg and 4.3% of patients in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0.6% of placebo-treated patients. Ten patients in the trial (<1.0%) experienced serious adverse events but there was no imbalance across treatment groups in either incidences or individual serious adverse events. Overall, the rates of withdrawal from treatment because of an adverse event were low (2.6% in 3 mg and 2.3% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0.8% in placebo) and discontinuations due to diarrhea were infrequent (1.7% in 3 mg and 1.2% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0 in placebo).
The IBS-C pre-NDA meeting with the FDA was completed in September 2016. We plan to file a New Drug Application Supplement with Clinical Data (sNDA) for TRULANCE in IBS-C in the first quarter of 2017 and we expect a 10-month review period from submission. We plan to present additional Phase 3 data from the two IBS-C trials at an appropriate scientific meeting later this year.

Dolcanatide (SP-333)
Dolcanatide, our second uroguanylin analog, is currently being explored for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Dolcanatide is designed to be an analog of uroguanylin with enhanced resistance to standard digestive breakdown by proteases in the intestine. We have demonstrated the potential anti-inflammatory role of uroguanylin and uroguanylin analogs in a number of preclinical colitis models. In these earlier animal studies, oral treatment with dolcanatide was shown to ameliorate DSS- and TNBS-induced acute colitis in murine models and ameliorate spontaneous colitis in T-cell receptor alpha knockout mice.
On January 11, 2016, we announced positive phase 1b data with dolcanatide in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-week study evaluating 28 patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. Analysis of the data indicates clear signals of improvement in dolcanatide-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients. Dolcanatide was also safe and well-tolerated. We plan to meet with regulatory agencies to discuss next steps in development for dolcanatide in mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. 
On November 19, 2014 we announced positive top-line results from a phase 2 trial assessing safety, efficacy and dose-response of three different once-daily oral dolcanatide tablets (1.0, 3.0 and 6.0 mg) compared with placebo in 289 patients with Opioid Induced Constipation (OIC). Analysis of the data indicates dolcanatide met the study’s primary endpoint and demonstrated statistically significant improvement in mean change from baseline in the number of spontaneous bowel 
6

movements (SBMs) during Week 4 of the treatment period. Dolcanatide was safe and well tolerated at all doses. We are exploring OIC as a potential lifecycle growth opportunity for TRULANCE.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies focusing on GI such as Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Allergan plc, Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AstraZeneca, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. and Shire, Plc. Most of our competitors have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than our resources. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures. We are aware of certain development projects for products to prevent or treat certain diseases targeted by us. The existence of these potential products or other products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect our ability to market the products we develop.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs include expenditures in connection with operating an in-house research and development laboratory, salaries and staff costs, application and filing for regulatory approval of proposed products, purchased in-process research and development, regulatory and scientific consulting fees, as well as contract research, patient costs, drug formulation and tableting, data collection, monitoring, clinical trial insurance. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were approximately $89.6 million, as compared to approximately $78 million and $83.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 730-10-55, Research and Development, we recorded prepaid research and development costs of approximately $0.5 million as of December 31, 2016 and $3.1 million as of December 31, 2015, for nonrefundable pre-payments for production of drug substance, analytical testing services and clinical trial costs for our drug candidates. In accordance with this guidance, we expense deferred research and development costs when drug compound is delivered or services are performed.
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently manage our global supply and distribution of TRULANCE through third party contract manufacturers. It is our objective to produce safe, pure and effective medicine. TRULANCE production consists of three phases-manufacture of (i) the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API (sometimes referred to as drug substance), (ii) manufacture of drug product and (iii) manufacture of packaged finished goods, as well as distribution agreements. We have entered into arrangements with third party manufacturers for the production of TRULANCE. We continue to pursue additional commercial supply agreements with additional manufacturers for TRULANCE for U.S. and worldwide use. We believe our commercial suppliers will have the capabilities to produce TRULANCE in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP, on a sufficient scale to meet our commercial needs.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We are able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as a trade secret or is protected by confidentiality agreements. Accordingly, patents or other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business.
As of December 31, 2016 we have 21 issued United States patents related to guanylate cyclase agonists. Two of these patents cover the composition-of-matter of TRULANCE and were issued on May 9, 2006 and September 21, 2010; they will expire in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The patent that issued on May 9, 2006 has claims directed to the species of TRULANCE, whereas the patent that issued on September 21, 2010 has claims directed to a genus of peptides that are identical in length to TRULANCE and is inclusive of TRULANCE. A third patent covers the composition-of-matter of dolcanatide issued on February 1, 2011 and expires in 2028.

We also have three patents related to gastrointestinal specific formulations of TRULANCE and dolcantide. These patents cover Australia, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. We also have one patent related to manufacture of TRULANCE. This patent covers Australia.
Additionally, as of the date of this report on Form 10-K, we have 17 pending United States utility patent applications; and 82 pending foreign patent applications relating to TRULANCE and dolcanatide, various derivatives and analogs of TRULANCE and dolcanatide, and their uses and manufacture.
In April 2010, two parties filed an opposition to one of our granted European patents with the European Patent Office. An opposition hearing was held December 14, 2011, which resulted in the European Patent Office issuing the following statement: “Account being taken of the amendments made by the patent proprietor during the opposition proceedings, the patent and the invention to which it relates are found to meet the requirements of the European Patent Convention (Art.101(3)(a)EPC).” In particular, the composition-of-matter claim covering TRULANCE was upheld.
On September 14, 2012 we entered into a binding letter of intent with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Ironwood”), pursuant to which we and Ironwood agreed to enter into a definitive license agreement giving us an exclusive worldwide license to Ironwood’s method of use patents on TRULANCE. The letter of intent contemplates a low single digit royalty on net sales of TRULANCE and both parties agreed not to challenge each other’s patents covering certain GC-C agonists, except that we retain the right to challenge Ironwood’s method of use patents on TRULANCE.
During 2013, we transferred ownership of all FV-100 intellectual property rights we acquired from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”), in August 2012, to ContraVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc., our former majority-owned subsidiary which we spun off to our shareholders on February 18, 2014. The FV-100 assets acquired by ContraVir from us were licensed from University College Cardiff Consultants Limited (“Cardiff”) pursuant to the terms of that certain Patent and Technology License Agreement, dated as of February 2, 2005, between Cardiff and Contravir Research Incorporated, an entity with no prior 
8

relationship with us (“CRI”), as amended March 27, 2007, which ContraVir assumed from us (the “Cardiff Agreement”). Cardiff and Rega Foundation (“Rega”) were originally the joint owners of the patent rights. Pursuant to the terms of an agreement, dated September 24, 1998, as amended December 23, 2004, Cardiff received from Rega an exclusive, irrevocable worldwide license to manufacture, use, sell, or otherwise deal in or with products utilizing the patent rights, including the right to grant sublicenses thereunder. We assumed the obligations under the Cardiff Agreement from BMS pursuant to the terms of the BMS Agreement. BMS assumed the obligations under the Cardiff Agreement from Inhibitex Inc. (“Inhibitex”) upon its acquisition of Inhibitex in January 2012. Inhibitex assumed the obligations under the Cardiff Agreement upon its acquisition of FermaVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“FermaVir”) in September 2010. FermaVir was the successor to CRI in a merger consummated in August 2005.
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
While trade secret protection is an essential element of our business and we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, we cannot give assurance that our unpatented proprietary technology will afford us significant commercial protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in intellectual property arising from their work for us. All employees sign an agreement not to engage in any conflicting employment or activity during their employment with us and not to disclose or misuse our confidential information. However, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated, and if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that employees, consultants or third parties will not breach the confidentiality provisions in our contracts, infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets and other proprietary rights or that measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate.
In the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. If we are forced to defend ourselves against such claims, whether they are with or without merit and whether they are resolved in favor of, or against, our licensors or us, we may face costly litigation and the diversion of management’s attention and resources. As a result of such disputes, we may have to develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
Government Regulation
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food and Drug Administration, and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and failure to abide by applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution, disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approval, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution.
FDA Approval Process
Our product candidates are regulated by the FDA as drugs. No manufacturer may market a new drug until it has submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA, and the FDA has approved it. The steps required before the FDA may approve an NDA generally include:

• | preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted in compliance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements;


• | development, manufacture and testing of active pharmaceutical product and dosage forms suitable for human use in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP;


• | the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its specific intended use(s);

9


• | the submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. We must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may commence human clinical trials. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after its receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions before that time about the conduct of the proposed trials. In such a case, we must work with the FDA to resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board for approval. An institutional review board may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the institutional review board’s requirements or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, though the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects, the drug is usually tested for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance and pharmacologic action, as well as to understand how the drug is taken up by and distributed within the body. Phase 2 usually involves studies in a limited patient population (individuals with the disease under study) to:

• | evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted conditions;


• | determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage as well as other important information about how to design larger Phase 3 trials; and


• | identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.

Phase 3 trials generally further evaluate clinical efficacy and test for safety within an expanded patient population. The conduct of the clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with good clinical practice regulations and guidance.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. We may also suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds.
The results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. If the NDA contains all pertinent information and data, the FDA will “file” the application and begin review. The FDA may “refuse to file” the NDA if it does not contain all pertinent information and data. In that case, the applicant may resubmit the NDA when it contains the missing information and data.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications. Most such applications for non-priority drug products are reviewed within 10 months. The review process, however, may be extended by FDA requests for additional information, preclinical or clinical studies, clarification regarding information already provided in the submission, or submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured and will not approve the product candidate unless GMP compliance is satisfactory. FDA also typically inspects facilities responsible for performing animal testing, as well as clinical investigators who participate in clinical trials. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information. The FDA may also limit the indications for use and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and our product candidates may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. The time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary to obtain FDA approval for regulated products can frequently exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product. The results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results from large-scale clinical trials, and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs, delays or modifications due to a number of factors, including difficulty in obtaining enough patients, investigators or product candidate supply. Failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals or in complying with requirements could adversely affect the commercialization of product candidates and our ability to receive product or royalty revenues.
Other Regulatory Requirements
After approval, drug products are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the FDA, which include company obligations to manufacture products in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, maintain and provide to the FDA updated safety and efficacy information, report adverse experiences with the product, keep certain records and submit periodic reports, obtain FDA approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, and comply with FDA promotion and advertising requirements and restrictions. Failure to meet these obligations can result in various adverse consequences, both voluntary and FDA-imposed, including product recalls, withdrawal of approval, restrictions on marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the NDA holder. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown safety or efficacy issues may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA holder.
We and any manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s GMP regulations. GMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation.  The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet GMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and any third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry- sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
Outside the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the European Union registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one European Union member state.
We are also subject to various environmental, health and safety regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials. From time to time, and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous materials.
