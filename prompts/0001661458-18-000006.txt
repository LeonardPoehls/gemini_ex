Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a self-advised and self-administered real estate investment trust (“REIT”) created to own and manage substantially all of the “non-core” assets previously owned and managed by our former parent, InvenTrust Properties Corp., a Maryland corporation (“InvenTrust”). On April 28, 2016, we were spun-off from InvenTrust through a pro rata distribution (the “Distribution”) by InvenTrust of 100% of the outstanding shares of our common stock to holders of InvenTrust’s common stock. Prior to or concurrent with the separation, we and InvenTrust engaged in certain reorganization transactions that were designed to consolidate substantially all of InvenTrust’s remaining “non-core” assets in Highlands REIT. 
This portfolio of “non-core” assets, which were acquired by InvenTrust between 2005 and 2008, included assets that are special use, single tenant or build to suit; face unresolved legal issues; are in undesirable locations or in weak markets or submarkets; are aging or functionally obsolete; and/or have sub-optimal leasing metrics. A number of our assets are retail properties located in tertiary markets, which are particularly susceptible to the negative trends affecting retail real estate. As a result of these characteristics, such assets are difficult to lease, finance and refinance and are relatively illiquid compared to other types of real estate assets. These factors also significantly limit our asset disposition options, impact the timing of such dispositions and restrict the viable options available to the Company for a future potential liquidity event.
Our strategy is focused on preserving, protecting and maximizing the total value of our portfolio with the long-term objective of providing stockholders with a return of their investment. We engage in rigorous asset management, and seek to sustain and enhance our portfolio, and improve the quality and income-producing ability of our portfolio, by engaging in selective dispositions, acquisitions, capital expenditures, financing, refinancing and enhanced leasing. We are also focused on cost containment efforts across our portfolio, improving our overall capital structure and making select investments in our existing “non-core” assets to maximize their disposition value. To the extent we are able to generate cash flows from operations or dispositions of assets, in addition to the cash uses outlined above, our Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to seek to reinvest in assets that are more likely to generate more reliable and stable cash flows, such as multi-family assets, as part of the Company’s overall strategy to optimize the value of the portfolio, enhance our options for a future potential liquidity event and maximize shareholder value. Given the nature and quality of the “non-core” assets in our portfolio as well as current market conditions, we expect this strategy will take multiple years to develop and execute. 
As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio consisted of two office assets, two industrial assets, six retail assets, two multi-family assets, two correctional facilities, two parcels of unimproved land and one bank branch. All of our assets are located in the United States, with little geographic concentration. We currently have three business segments, consisting of (i) net lease, (ii) retail and (iii) multi-tenant office. Our multi-family and unimproved land assets are presented in Other (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding segment reporting). We may have additional or fewer segments in the future to the extent we enter into additional real property sectors, dispose of property sectors, or change the character of assets. Highlands was incorporated in December 2015 as a Maryland corporation and operates in a manner that allows us to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal tax purposes.

Business Strategy
Our investment objectives are to preserve, protect and maximize the total value of our portfolio. Given the quality and nature of the assets in our portfolio, which are generally disjointed, non-institutional grade, relatively illiquid, require substantial time and investment to bring to market and are not positioned to protect capital or deliver an acceptable risk-adjusted return, as well as current market conditions, we expect that this strategy will take multiple years to develop and execute. In order to meet our investment objectives, we intend to continue to engage in rigorous asset management, seek to sustain and enhance our portfolio, and improve the quality and income-producing ability of our portfolio, by engaging in selective dispositions, acquisitions, capital expenditures, financing, refinancing and enhanced leasing. We are also focused on cost containment efforts across our portfolio, improving its overall capital structure and making select investments in our existing “non-core” assets to maximize their value. To the extent we are able to generate cash flows from operations or dispositions of assets, in addition to the cash uses outlined above, our Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to seek to reinvest in assets that are more likely to generate more reliable and stable cash flows, such as multi-family assets, as part of the Company's overall strategy to optimize the value of the portfolio, enhance our options for a future liquidity event and maximize shareholder value. We are currently exploring appropriate markets and evaluating potential acquisitions for our multi-family portfolio.
Disposition Policy 
 We evaluate each of our assets on a rigorous and ongoing basis in an effort to optimize and enhance the total value of our portfolio. In furtherance of this strategy, for the foreseeable future, we anticipate disposing of select “non-core” assets that are not generating income or have unfavorable risk-adjusted returns and generally, using the proceeds from such sales to prepare other “non-core” assets for sale or invest in assets that are more likely to generate more reliable and stable cash flows, such as multi-family assets.
The determination of when a particular asset should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of all of the relevant factors, including whether such disposition will better position the portfolio for a potential future liquidity event, prevailing and projected economic and market conditions, the cash flow being generated by a particular asset, tax implications of a disposition, investment opportunities for any cash proceeds, debt characteristics of the asset, and whether the value of the asset is anticipated to decline or increase. The timing of any disposition will depend upon then-prevailing economic and market conditions and the factors described above, which could result in differing holding periods among the assets. There can be no assurance that dispositions will occur as planned, on acceptable terms, or within our desired timing.
Foreclosure Proceedings
3

With respect to certain of our properties, once the leases for such properties expire, we may be unable to make mortgage payments and may default under the applicable loan agreement. This may force us to dispose of those assets on disadvantageous terms, or the lender under such mortgages may foreclose. Generally, a borrower in foreclosure proceedings has limited or no control over the timing and speed of such proceedings, and the ultimate resolution of such proceedings may take years. Our Dulles Executive Plaza, AT&T-Hoffman Estates and AT&T-St. Louis assets have all been conveyed to their respective lenders through various cooperative foreclosure proceedings. Such foreclosures have adversely impacted our revenues and cash flows from operations. See also “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Debt Financing-If we are unable to repay or refinance our existing debt as it comes due, we may need to sell the underlying asset sooner than anticipated or the lender may foreclose, in which case our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.”
Financing Strategy
Certain of our existing assets are currently encumbered by debt, and debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, tenant improvements, acquisition financing, leasing commissions, general corporate purposes and other working capital needs. The form of our indebtedness may vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes, but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risk on variable rate debt. For additional information regarding our existing debt, please refer to “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Borrowings.”
As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, no debt is recourse to the Company, although the Company or its subsidiaries may act as guarantor under customary, non-recourse carve-out clauses in our wholly owned property-owning subsidiaries' mortgage loans.
Customers
A significant portion of our revenue has historically been generated by AT&T, Inc. (“AT&T”). For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 19% and 41% of our total annualized rental income was generated by three single-tenant assets leased to affiliates of AT&T. One of those leases expired in 2016, and another expired in 2017, with both of the underlying assets being foreclosed upon. The property underlying the third lease was recently sold. The loss of revenue historically generated by those properties leased to AT&T will have an adverse impact on our future revenues. Approximately 18% of our current revenue derives from a net lease with The GEO Group, Inc. on our Hudson correctional facility asset. The lease on this property expires in January of 2020 and if we are unable to re-lease the property, or re-lease on similar terms, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations would be adversely affected.
Conflict of Interest Policy
We maintain policies designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. Any transaction between us and any director, officer or 5% stockholder must be approved pursuant to our related party transaction policy. In addition, we have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that seeks to identify and mitigate conflicts of interest between our employees, directors and officers and our company. However, we cannot assure you that these policies or provisions of law will always be successful in eliminating or minimizing the influence of such conflicts, and if they are not successful, decisions could be made that might fail to reflect fully the interests of stockholders.
Certain Other Policies
We intend to engage in future investment activities in a manner that is consistent with the requirements applicable to REITs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to so qualify as a REIT.
We may issue senior securities, purchase and sell investments, offer securities in exchange for property and repurchase or reacquire shares or other securities in the future. To the extent we engage in these activities, we will comply with applicable law.
We do not currently have policies in place with respect to making loans to other persons (other than our conflict of interest policies described above) or investing in securities.
Competition
4

We are subject to significant competition in seeking tenants for the leasing of our assets, buyers for the sale of assets and sellers for the acquisition of assets. We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investing banking firms, lenders, hedge funds, governmental bodies and other entities. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may have substantially more operating experience than us. We also face competition from other real estate investment programs for buyers, sellers and tenants that may be suitable for us. We perceive there to be a lower level of competition for certain assets in our portfolio based on, among other things, the characteristics of such assets, the number of willing buyers and the volume of transactions in their respective markets, which may make it challenging for us to sell these assets or attract tenants. Many of our retail tenants face intense competition from online retailers, which impacts demand for our brick-and-mortar retail real estate. A shift to e-commerce sales may adversely impact our retail tenants' sales thus causing those retailers to reduce the number of their retail locations in the future.
Regulations
Our assets are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our assets.
Environmental
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of U.S. federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on assets in which we hold an interest, or on assets that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, we had nine full-time employees, not including consultants and part time workers. Due to the nature of our portfolio and our business strategy, we rely on consultants and third parties, under our supervision, to perform many routine operations for us.
Insurance
We have insurance coverage for our properties which includes the type of coverage and limits we believe to be appropriate for each property and our business operations. Such coverage typically includes commercial general liability and property insurance which, includes property damage and loss of rental income resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood and extended coverage. Our management believes our insurance coverage contains policy terms and conditions and insured limits that are customary for similar properties and operations.
