Item 1.   Business
Overview
 
We use proprietary taste receptor technologies to discover, develop and commercialize innovative flavor ingredients and natural high intensity sweeteners, or HIS, primarily for the packaged food, beverage and ingredient supply industries. We consider flavor ingredients to include flavors that impart a taste, such as savory and cooling, and flavors with modifying properties, such as sweet and salt taste modifiers and bitter blockers. Flavors with modifying properties is a term used by the flavor industry to describe ingredients that function as part of a flavor system to enhance the taste profile in a variety of food and beverages. We sometimes refer to these flavors with modifying properties as “modifiers.” We believe our flavor ingredients and natural HIS will enable packaged food, beverage and ingredient supply companies to improve the nutritional profile (e.g., reduce calories) of their products while maintaining or improving taste and, in certain cases, generating cost of goods savings.
 
Historically, we have derived our revenues from collaborative agreements by licensing our flavor ingredients to our collaborators on an exclusive or co-exclusive basis. As our technology has evolved and as we have demonstrated our ability to discover and develop novel flavor ingredients and natural HIS, we have transitioned to primarily non-exclusive licensing arrangements. We expect most future licenses of our flavor ingredients and natural HIS to be licensed to third-party collaborators on a non-exclusive basis. Non-exclusive collaborations provide our collaborators with access to our proprietary technology and products while not encumbering the commercial potential of the products we develop. We currently have collaborative agreements with several of the world’s leading packaged food, beverage and ingredient companies, including Ajinomoto Co., Inc., or Ajinomoto, Firmenich SA, or Firmenich, and PepsiCo, Inc., or PepsiCo. Depending upon the collaboration, our collaboration agreements historically have provided license fees, research and development funding, reimbursement of certain costs, milestone payments based upon our achievement of research or development goals and, in the event of commercialization, commercial milestones, minimum periodic royalties and/or royalties on sales of products incorporating our flavor ingredients. 
 
In addition to revenues from collaborative agreements, we have a complementary commercialization strategy whereby we sell certain of our flavor ingredients directly to flavor companies for re-sale to their food and beverage company customers. The flavor companies add value by incorporating our ingredients into proprietary flavor systems, which include a combination or variety of flavor ingredients, for their customers. We also have the ability to sell certain of our flavor ingredients directly to food, beverage, consumer product and pharmaceutical customers. To support this direct sales program, we have established relationships with third party manufacturers. Our commercial revenues under the direct sales program are generated from sales of our flavor ingredients to flavor companies and other customers.

Individuals experience the sensation of taste when food and beverage products interact with taste receptors in the mouth. A taste receptor functions either by physically binding to a flavor ingredient in a process analogous to the way a key fits into a lock or by acting as a channel to allow ions to flow directly into a taste cell. As a result of these interactions, signals are sent to the brain where a specific taste sensation is registered. There are currently five recognized primary tastes: sweet, umami (which is the savory taste of glutamate), bitter, salt and sour. In addition, there are secondary taste sensations, such as cool, hot and fat.
 
We are currently pursuing the discovery, development and/or commercialization of our flavor ingredients through five programs focused on sweet, savory, bitter, cooling and salt taste areas. Currently, the primary goals of our sweet taste program are the discovery, development and/or commercialization of both natural HIS and flavor modifiers that allow our customers to maintain the desired sweet taste in consumer products that have a significant reduction in sweeteners. The current goals of our savory flavor program are to commercialize our portfolio of novel flavor ingredients that mimic the taste of naturally occurring glutamate to enable the reduction or replacement of added monosodium glutamate, or MSG, and to provide new savory tastes to foods by combining our savory flavor ingredients with other ingredients to create unique new flavors. The current goal of our bitter blocker program is to support commercialization of our bitter blocker BB68 for use in products that reduce or block bitter taste to improve the overall taste characteristics of packaged foods, beverages, over the counter, or OTC, health care products and pharmaceutical products. The goal of our cooling taste program is to support the commercialization of novel cooling flavor ingredients that have advantages over currently available flavor ingredients for a variety of applications. The goal of our salt taste program is to validate a taste-related protein as a screening target to identify flavor ingredients that allow a significant reduction of sodium in foods and beverages yet maintain the salty taste desirable to consumers.

Industry Background
 
High Intensity Sweetener Industry Overview
 
Natural and artificial HIS are used in a wide variety of packaged food, beverage and ingredient products throughout the world. In the United States, current artificial HIS approved for use include saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), sucralose, neotame, and advantame. The most widely used natural HIS products in the United States are derivatives of Stevia. Artificial HIS have fallen out of favor with many consumers. In light of this trend, along with the desire to reduce calories while maintaining great taste, efforts have increased in the pursuit of novel natural HIS. According to LMC International, in 2016, the annual worldwide consumption of HIS on a commercial basis was close to 127,500 metric tons at an estimated value of $1.38 billion. The only natural HIS included in this estimate were Stevia products with approximately 3,800 metric tons consumed at an estimated value of $332 million. Furthermore, the annual growth rate for HIS has exceeded that of both sucrose and high fructose corn syrup (6.1% growth for total HIS compared to 0.8% growth for sucrose and 0.5% for high fructose corn syrup). In the United States, HIS are regulated under the provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act. The regulatory approval process for HIS can vary significantly and is further described under Regulatory Process below. 
 
Flavor Industry Overview
 
Flavor ingredients are used in a variety of packaged food, beverage and ingredient products throughout the world. Flavor ingredients can be either natural or artificial compounds. Flavor ingredients are generally sold as part of a flavor system developed by a flavor company. Flavor systems are then sold for use by packaged food and beverage companies or companies that make pharmaceutical or OTC products.

While a few packaged food, beverage and ingredient companies have their own internal flavor research and development programs, most have traditionally relied on purchases of flavor systems from third parties. Historically, most third party flavor companies have purchased or manufactured flavor ingredients on a commodity basis and then used these to create flavor systems for their packaged food and beverage customers. The ability to incorporate unique flavors that deliver a great taste profile in end products is a key consideration for packaged food and beverage companies as they strive to differentiate their brands in the marketplace. As such, flavor companies are constantly looking to identify unique, value-added ingredients that will help to meet their customers’ needs for innovative flavor solutions. 
 
Traditionally, companies have discovered new flavor ingredients primarily by using inefficient, non-automated and labor-intensive trial and error processes involving a limited number of trained taste testers. Using this approach, taste testers must physically taste each potential flavor ingredient to assess the taste characteristics of the compound. Taste testers can assess only a limited number of potential flavor ingredients at one time due to the sensory fatigue that results from repeated tasting. As a result, only a small fraction of the available universe of ingredients can be tested economically.
 
Flavor ingredients are regulated in the United States under provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act. Flavor ingredients sold in countries and regions outside the United States are also subject to regulations imposed by national governments or regional regulatory authorities, as is the case in the European Union. The regulatory regime for flavor ingredients is further described under Regulatory Process below.
 
Packaged Food and Beverage Industry
 
Packaged food and beverage products include carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, baked goods, dairy products, frozen foods, snack foods, main meal and side dish mixes, canned soup and numerous other products. According to recent data from Euromonitor International, an independent research organization, over 762 million metric tons of packaged food were sold worldwide in 2016. This figure is comprised of the weight of ready-to-eat finished food products (e.g., yogurt) and the weight of the concentrated forms of products before adding water or other components required for reconstitution (e.g., condensed soup). The worldwide sales of packaged food and beverage products in 2016 were approximately $3.0 trillion, of which over $578 billion were generated in the United States. These figures represent annual growth rates of approximately 4.5% and 1.9%, respectively, over 2011 amounts. Based on these estimates, of the worldwide total, sales of packaged foods were approximately $2.08 trillion and sales of non-alcoholic beverages were approximately $913.6 billion.1Flavor Ingredients as a Source of Competitive Advantage
 
The packaged food, beverage and ingredient industries are comprised of a number of large and highly competitive market segments. Small market share gains in specific large market segments can translate into significant additional revenue for packaged food, beverage and ingredient companies. As a result of these market opportunities, packaged food, beverage and ingredient companies are constantly seeking ways to differentiate their products, as consumer demand can be greatly affected by very small actual or perceived improvements in flavor or health profiles. Flavor ingredients can potentially provide an important way to differentiate a particular product through improvements in nutritional profile, flavor innovation and cost of goods savings while delivering great taste.
Our Solution
 
We use our proprietary taste receptor-based assays and screening technologies to discover and develop novel flavor ingredients and natural HIS. We have developed proprietary taste receptor-based assays for use in our high-throughput screening systems to rapidly and efficiently screen our sample libraries and identify large numbers of novel potential flavor ingredients and natural HIS. We believe our approach improves the likelihood that ingredients with the desired characteristics can be discovered and then optimized into novel flavor ingredients.

We believe our process will result in the discovery and development of flavor ingredients that will address the following key challenges faced by the packaged food, beverage, ingredient supply and consumer goods industries:
 

• | Identifying Natural Ingredients. We are using our technologies to screen libraries of natural samples isolated from plants and other natural sources to discover new natural HIS and flavor ingredients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving or Maintaining Taste. Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize flavor ingredients that will enable food and beverage manufacturers to improve or maintain the taste of their offerings while also enhancing the nutritional profile of packaged food, beverage and ingredient products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reducing Sweeteners, MSG and Salt in Packaged Food and Beverage Products. Our resources are focused on discovering, developing and/or commercializing natural HIS and flavor ingredients that, when added as part of a flavor system, will enable food and beverage manufacturers to significantly reduce the levels of sugar, fructose, artificial sweeteners, MSG and salt in packaged food and beverage products while maintaining or improving taste. We believe reducing the levels of such ingredients will help to improve the nutritional profile of packaged food and beverage products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Blocking Undesirable Tastes. We have developed flavor ingredients that we believe will be useful in blocking bitter and other unwanted tastes associated with certain packaged food and beverage products. Our technology may also be used to improve the taste of products outside of food and beverages, such as OTC health care products and pharmaceutical products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Delivering Proprietary Flavor Ingredients. Through our direct sales program, we are able to offer flavor companies our proprietary flavor ingredients for incorporation into their flavor systems for re-sale to food and beverage manufacturers. We believe this approach will allow numerous food and beverage manufacturers to improve or maintain the taste of their offerings while improving the nutritional profile of packaged food, beverage and ingredient products. We are also able to offer our future collaborators and customers non-exclusive use of certain proprietary flavor ingredients in defined packaged food, beverage and ingredient product categories and geographies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reducing Cost of Goods. We believe our proprietary flavor ingredients will enable food and beverage manufacturers to reduce overall raw material ingredient costs in certain cases, particularly for those products containing high levels of carbohydrate sweeteners and MSG.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reducing Environmental Impact. Flavor ingredients such as our sweet taste modifiers can be used as part of a flavor system to reduce the use of sweeteners such as sucrose, or common table sugar, and high fructose corn syrup. This can reduce the cost and environmental impact of transporting the goods, as well as the use of water and fertilizers to grow the associated crops. In addition, in the case of powdered or concentrated products, a reduction in the use of added sweeteners may allow manufacturers to reduce package sizes and therefore use less packaging materials without impacting serving sizes or the number of servings in a single package.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to become the leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of new natural HIS and proprietary flavor ingredients that are commercialized either through collaborations with leading companies or through direct sales by us. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Maintaining and Expanding Our Technology Position. We believe our proprietary taste receptor-based technologies, including our receptor discovery, assay development and high-throughput screening technologies, and our natural and artificial sample libraries provide us and our collaborators with significant competitive advantages. Our scientific staff continues to explore new assay conditions as a method to identify potential new lead HIS and flavor ingredient candidates. We intend to continue to add to our sample libraries and develop and acquire proprietary technologies and related intellectual property rights to expand and enhance our ability to discover, develop and commercialize new HIS and proprietary flavor ingredients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Developing Natural HIS. We have discovered nearly 300 natural sweeteners since 2010 through our proprietary taste science technologies. After conducting a comprehensive analysis of the taste and physical properties, we have advanced our lead novel sweetener, siratose, a minor component of Luo Han Guo (also known as monk fruit), into the development phase. In addition, we continue to acquire and screen libraries of natural products for potential future product candidates.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing Flavor Ingredients that are Eligible for Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association, or FEMA, Generally Recognized as Safe, or GRAS, Determination. Historically, a primary focus has been on the development of flavors and flavors with modifying properties that will qualify for a FEMA GRAS determination. Sixteen flavor ingredients developed as part of our savory, sweet, bitter and cool programs have received FEMA GRAS determination. Upon receipt of GRAS determination, our collaborators and customers can begin to test market and commercialize retail products or flavor systems incorporating our flavor ingredients in several key markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collaborating With Leading Packaged Food, Beverage and Ingredient Companies. We are collaborating with leading packaged food, beverage, flavor and ingredient companies to develop and commercialize certain of our product candidates. Under our legacy license agreements, our collaborators are allowed exclusive use, co-exclusive use, or a limited period of exclusive use of certain of our proprietary flavor ingredients in defined packaged food, beverage and ingredient product categories and geographies. In general, our collaborators are responsible for manufacturing, marketing, selling and distributing their products incorporating flavor ingredients discovered and developed by us. In addition, our collaborators are responsible for all costs of manufacturing our flavor ingredients for their own use. As a result, we expect that certain of our flavor ingredients will be commercialized without incurring significant sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution costs. We seek to establish additional natural HIS program collaborations with leading companies on a non-exclusive basis.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing Market Opportunities through Direct Sales. We seek to optimize the value of our flavor ingredients by creating new opportunities to increase their usage by food, beverage and other consumer product companies. Our direct sales efforts are focused on selling certain of our flavor ingredients directly to flavor companies. We also have the ability to sell certain of our flavor ingredients directly to food, beverage, consumer product and pharmaceutical customers. We expect flavor companies to add value by incorporating our ingredients into proprietary flavor systems for re-sale to their consumer product company customers. Our sales team also reaches out directly to these consumer product companies to conduct introductory presentations and taste tests of our portfolio flavor ingredients. This effort has been effective in generating awareness of our direct sales program by these end users, which in turn is leading them to contact their preferred flavor company suppliers for additional information and to request samples. We believe the direct sales program enables a deeper and broader penetration of the food and beverage industry and accelerates commercialization by expanding the market for our products.

Our Discovery and Development Process and Programs
 
The following diagram summarizes our discovery and development process.

The key elements of our Discovery and Development process are:
 

• | Identification of Relevant Taste Receptors and Proprietary Taste Receptor-Based Assay Development. The first steps in our discovery and development process are to identify the relevant taste receptors and to develop proprietary assays based on the identified receptors. Our assays are tests that measure interactions between the taste receptors and potential flavor ingredients or natural HIS. To date, we have developed assays to test for compounds that interact with receptors associated with savory, sweet, bitter and cooling tastes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High-Throughput Screening and Identification of Potential HIS and Flavor Ingredients. The next step in our discovery and development process is to use our proprietary taste receptor-based assays to identify compounds that bind to taste receptors, known as hits. We use automated high-throughput screening to rapidly evaluate our diverse natural and artificial libraries. The libraries are primarily comprised of compounds we have purchased from third party vendors, compounds we have developed in-house and plant sources we have acquired and fractionated into smaller components. A panel of taste testers then evaluates the taste effect of the most potent hits. Based on this evaluation, we designate hits that exhibit a positive taste effect as proof-of-concept compounds. We then select the most promising of those proof-of-concept compounds, which we call lead compounds, for optimization.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimization of Lead Compounds and Selection of Product Candidates. The next step in our discovery and development process is to modify our lead compounds to allow lower amounts of the compound to be used in the finished product and/or improve the activity to meet the taste attribute goals of our collaborators. Optimization may also be required to improve the physical properties of a compound so that it is stable under manufacturing, storage and food preparation conditions. We refer to optimized compounds that provide desirable attributes in product prototypes as product candidates. When screening libraries from natural sources, optimization involves selecting the appropriate source and developing the most efficient process, such as fermentation, to obtain the active compound.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety Studies and Regulatory Approval of Product Candidates. The next step in our discovery and development process is to select one or more product candidates for development and potential commercialization. We then evaluate the selected product candidate for safety in accordance with industry standards, including preliminary in-vitro evaluation and additional in-vivo studies to confirm an acceptable safety profile. Following this evaluation, we submit the safety data along with the physical and chemical properties of the flavor ingredient product candidate and a description of manufacturing and conditions of intended use to FEMA for review. The FEMA review is conducted by an independent Expert Panel identified and convened by FEMA. If the Expert Panel determines the product candidate to be GRAS, data from the safety studies supporting the GRAS determination are provided to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and published in the journal Food Technology. The FEMA GRAS determination allows the flavor ingredients to be commercialized in the United States and several other countries and regions. The FEMA GRAS determination also facilitates regulatory determinations in a number of additional countries.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Sixteen flavor ingredients developed as part of our savory, sweet, bitter and cool programs have received FEMA GRAS determinations. In our experience, the process from selection for development until receipt of that determination has historically ranged from 12 to 18 months. Costs associated with the FEMA GRAS process, including external third-party safety studies and preparation of the application, have been approximately $1.5 million per flavor ingredient. Product candidates that we develop in the future may require a similar amount of time and cost. However, the length of time and cost may vary depending on the properties of the product candidate. In addition, regulatory approval of the product candidates in other jurisdictions may require that we conduct additional studies or incur additional expenses. Furthermore, the United States regulatory approval of natural HIS will likely require submission through the Food Additive Petition or FDA GRAS notification process, as described further under Regulatory Process below.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The goal of the natural HIS component of our sweet taste program is to discover and develop novel no- or low-calorie natural HIS. We continue to make progress in our efforts to discover and develop natural HIS, including the discovery of nearly 300 natural sweeteners since 2010 through our proprietary taste science technologies. After conducting a comprehensive analysis of the taste and physical properties, we have advanced our lead novel sweetener, siratose, into the development phase. Siratose has demonstrated greater potency and a better taste profile than rebaudioside-A, the most used sweetener from stevia plants, in sensory evaluations. In addition, siratose has shown improved stability in low pH products, such as carbonated beverages, and increased solubility, making it easier to work with compared to all known stevia plant based sweeteners. Importantly, siratose has also demonstrated potency and overall taste quality superior to existing monk fruit sweeteners and superior to over 50 other minor sweetener components found in both monk fruit and the monk fruit plant that we have evaluated.

The goal of the sweet taste modifier component of our sweet taste program is to restore the desired taste profile of products in which natural and artificial sweeteners have been reduced. We completed development activities and received FEMA GRAS determination for sucrose and high fructose corn syrup sweet taste modifier Sweetmyx® FS22 during 2017. We continue our efforts to discover and develop natural sweet taste modifiers, and we have achieved a taste proof-of-concept for a natural sweet taste modifier. The next step is the identification of a natural sweet taste modifier which meets the potency and physical property requirements to be commercially viable. 
 
The goal of our savory taste program is to discover and develop novel savory flavor ingredients that mimic the taste of naturally occurring glutamate to enable the reduction or replacement of added monosodium glutamate, or MSG, and to provide new savory tastes to foods by combining our savory flavor ingredients with other ingredients to create unique new flavors. Our efforts are focused on the discovery and development of natural savory flavor ingredients to optimize the value of our large natural sample library.
 
The goal of our bitter blocker program is to discover and develop novel bitter blockers that reduce or block bitter taste ingredients found in many products thereby improving the overall taste characteristics. Our efforts are focused on bitter blockers for over the counter, or OTC, health care products and pharmaceutical products since these products typically do not desire a natural flavor solution.
 
The goal of our cooling taste program is to support the commercialization of novel cooling flavor ingredients that have advantages over currently available flavor ingredients for a variety of applications.  Our efforts are focused on screening samples from our proprietary library to discover novel cooling taste ingredients intended to improve upon the properties of existing cooling ingredients such as menthol with benefits which may include reduced odor, greater potency or improved temporal sensory profiles. 
 

The goal of the salt taste program is to identify flavor ingredients that allow a significant reduction of sodium in foods and beverages yet maintain the salty taste desirable to consumers. We are using analytical approaches to evaluate a large proprietary database of proteins found in taste buds in order to prioritize and find the specific protein or group of proteins that function to detect salt in foods. We are currently screening target proteins with a goal of validating the protein(s) that function in human salty taste perception, supporting our use of the protein(s) as research targets to discover new salt flavor modifiers using our novel flavor technology. Our current efforts include optimizing our assay hits to improve the potency and solubility for further sensory evaluations.
 


Regulatory Process
 
In the United States, flavoring substances, including flavor ingredients intended for use in foods and beverages, and HIS are regulated under provisions of the FD&C Act. Flavor ingredients sold in countries and regions outside of the United States are also subject to regulations imposed by national governments or regional regulatory authorities, as is the case in the European Union. These regulations are subject to frequent revisions and interpretation.
 
Regulation of Flavor Ingredients and Natural HIS in the United States. In the United States, flavor ingredients and natural HIS may be regulated as approved food additives, but more typically as GRAS substances under the FD&C Act. The Food Additive Amendments of 1958 prompted the flavor industry to establish in 1960 the FEMA Expert Panel. FEMA has administered a GRAS program for flavor ingredients on behalf of the industry for nearly 60 years. Several countries outside of the United States, including Canada, Brazil, Argentina and the Philippines, allow flavor use in food based on GRAS determination by the FEMA Expert Panel. Several other countries either add new FEMA GRAS ingredients to their positive lists of approved flavoring agents or add the new FEMA GRAS lists to their flavor regulations by specific reference. The other possible route for approval of a flavor-modifying ingredient is a GRAS self-determination (independent of FEMA) with or without FDA notification. Our goal is that the flavor ingredients we discover will achieve GRAS determination by the independent FEMA Expert Panel.
 
GRAS Review Process. Flavor ingredients that qualify for the GRAS review process are generally intended to be consumed in small quantities and have data supporting their safety under conditions of intended use. An independent Expert Panel, convened to undertake a GRAS review, determines whether an ingredient is generally recognized as safe under the conditions of its intended use. These experts are qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of certain new ingredients used in food. Under the GRAS process, manufacturers are required to obtain safety data from the scientific literature or through the conduct of safety studies, determine the estimated daily intake of the flavor ingredient per person and submit a report to the GRAS review panel describing the physical, structural, safety, and metabolic properties of the flavor ingredient.

The most common types of GRAS reviews are:
 

• | FEMA Expert Panel. The FEMA Expert Panel is an independent panel of experts for which FEMA provides administrative assistance. The FEMA Expert Panel, which may be used by FEMA members and certain other parties, meets up to three times per year. If the FEMA Expert Panel determines a flavor ingredient to be GRAS, information about the GRAS determination is published in the journal Food Technology and all of the data is provided to the FDA. To our knowledge, the FDA has not challenged the FEMA Expert Panel’s conclusion that the use of a flavoring substance is GRAS. Sixteen of our flavor ingredients have been determined to be GRAS by the FEMA Expert Panel.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Specifically Convened Independent Panel. An independent, qualified panel of experts in pertinent scientific disciplines may be formed by the manufacturer to evaluate the safety of a specific ingredient for GRAS status. This process is known as “self-determination of GRAS status.” The basis for the GRAS self-determination is not required to be submitted to the FDA. However, the FDA may request information on ingredients that have been self-determined to be GRAS.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
United States FDA GRAS Notification Process.  With respect to certain natural HIS, a summary of the GRAS determination may be submitted to the FDA for evaluation. If the FDA is satisfied with the data, it may issue a “letter of no objection”. The current commercialized forms of Stevia have gone through this process. Our goal is to attain regulatory approval through this FDA GRAS notification process for our lead novel sweetener, siratose, a minor component of Luo Han Guo (also known as monk fruit) and any future natural HIS candidates that we discover.
 
Food Additive Petition Process.  Food ingredients may be evaluated through a food additive petition. If there is insufficient general knowledge or for a variety of other reasons, including unusual conditions of intended use, it may be necessary to file a food additive petition with the FDA. Food additive petitions contain information on the structural nature of the ingredient, the manufacturing process, information on use in food, estimates of human exposure from use of the ingredient in food and all known information related to the safety of the ingredient. The FDA reviews the petition content, requests additional information if necessary, publishes a proposed rule for use in food, reviews comments on the proposed rule and publishes a final rule, if the use is determined to be acceptable. The safety data requirements for food additives are the same as for GRAS substances, although high use substances may require additional safety data. We estimate that a food additive petition could cost up to $10 million and may take up to four years to complete for submission. Furthermore, additional studies adding cost and time to approval may be required depending on the results of the initial safety studies. Examples of ingredients that have gone through a food additive petition process include the artificial sweeteners aspartame, acesulfame K and sucralose. It may be necessary for certain natural HIS that we may discover or develop to follow this regulatory route.
 
Regulation of Flavor Ingredients and Natural HIS outside of the United States. Outside of the United States, flavor approvals vary by country. There is, however, some commonality in approach in many countries. As explained above, several countries either accept GRAS determination by the FEMA Expert Panel as the basis for approval or GRAS determination facilitates country approval. Many countries, particularly developing countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, accept favorable review by the WHO/FAO Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, or JECFA, as the basis for approval or to facilitate approval. The International Organization of the Flavour Industry (IOFI) automatically submits new GRAS ingredients to the Codex Alimentarius through the FDA for JECFA review. Some other countries have their own unique approval processes. The European Union, or EU, has established EU-wide regulations for flavor ingredient use based on safety evaluations by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and risk management (i.e., regulation development) by the Directorate General for Health (DG Sante). A number of countries in eastern Europe or in Africa accept EU approval as the basis for approved use. China, Japan and Indonesia also have independent regulatory review processes for flavors. We have received regulatory approvals for several of our flavor ingredients from JECFA, EFSA, the Chinese Ministry of Health and other authorities outside of the United States.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
Our policy is to file patent applications and to protect technologies, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. For example, we may seek patent protection for receptors and nucleic acid sequences encoding receptors that are involved in taste and the use of such receptors to identify ingredients that modulate taste. As of December 31, 2017 we are the owner or the exclusive licensee of 233 issued United States patents, 35 pending United States patent applications, 422 issued foreign patents and 187 pending foreign applications covering various aspects of our proprietary technology. Our issued patents have terms that expire between 2019 and 2036. The earliest patent expiration for our approved flavor ingredients is in 2024 for certain savory flavor ingredients. We also rely on trademarks to protect our proprietary technology. Generally, United States patents have a term of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from the earliest claimed priority date, whichever is later, for patents issued from applications filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office prior to June 8, 1995 or 20 years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date in the case of patents issued from applications filed on or after June 8, 1995. Patents in most other countries have a term of 20 years from the date of filing the patent application. We intend to continue to file patent applications as we discover and develop new flavor ingredients, HIS and technologies.
Commercialization
 
Following regulatory approval in a given country, foods and beverages containing our proprietary flavor ingredients can be commercialized immediately. Our collaborators and direct sales customers have ultimate responsibility for the commercialization of our flavor ingredients in their end product and flavor system offerings, respectively. Prior to commercialization, collaborators and customers complete extensive product formulation work on their targeted product and flavor system offerings. Food and beverage manufacturers may validate final formulations for products through in-house sensory evaluation as well as external taste tests by target consumers. Upon confirming consumer acceptance of new or reformulated products that include a Senomyx ingredient, the companies complete activities such as the development of packaging and sales materials, and initial manufacturing scale-up of the products, enabling their market launch.
Market Overview
 
Each of our programs focuses on flavor ingredients that address large, potentially overlapping markets. Our sweet taste program is aimed at discovering and developing natural HIS or flavor ingredients that could be used in product categories such as beverages, dairy products and baked goods. Our savory flavor program is aimed at commercialization of flavor ingredients that could be used in product categories such as ready-to-eat meals, sauces, soups, pastas, dried foods and snack foods. Our bitter blocker program is focused on commercialization of flavor ingredients that could be used in food and beverage products that contain bitter tasting ingredients, such as rebaudioside A, hydrolyzed whey and soy proteins, caffeine and menthol. Our cooling taste program is aimed at commercialization of flavor ingredients that could be used in products that incorporate cooling agents, such as cough medicines, confectionaries and OTC oral hygiene products. Our salt taste program is aimed at developing flavor ingredients that could be used in virtually all food product categories.
 
Our commercial revenues to date are primarily based on royalties under a retail or ingredient supply based collaboration agreements and direct sales to flavor houses. In our retail-based agreements, royalties are calculated as a percentage of the net sales price of a manufacturer’s finished products or are based on the volume of a manufacturer’s finished product that it sells. In our ingredient supply-based agreements, royalties are calculated as a percentage of the sales price of either our flavor ingredient itself or the flavor system in which our flavor ingredient is contained or are based on the volume of the flavor ingredient itself used by a manufacturer in a finished product. We also sell certain novel flavor ingredients to targeted flavor companies for their use in proprietary flavor systems. 
 
The market potential, partners and licenses for our key programs are described below.
 
Sweet Taste Program
 
Current products from our sweet taste program are intended to maintain or improve the sweet taste of consumer products that have reduced levels of certain sweeteners such as sucralose, sucrose and high fructose corn syrup. To-date, we have four commercialized products: S2383, a novel sucralose modifier; S6973 (SR69) and S9632 (SR96), two novel sucrose modifiers; and S617, a sucrose and HFCS modifier. 
 
 11


The annual worldwide consumption of sucrose, fructose and high fructose corn syrup is estimated to be $92 billion at a volume of 193 million metric tons. The annual sucralose market is approximately $433 million at a commercial basis volume of 6,436 metric tons. These estimates are based on 2016 data from LMC International, Milling & Baking News and the USDA Economic Research Service.
 
The most compelling product category for products from our sweet taste program is the non-alcoholic beverage market. According to Beverage Digest, 2016 global volume exceeded 142 billion unit cases (each unit case is 192 ounces). The second largest segment of this market is carbonated soft drinks with global volume of just over 36 billion unit cases. The following table provides additional detail for 2016 on the key segments of the global non-alcoholic beverage market.
 

Beverage Type | Unit Cases (billions & %) | | Vol. +/-
-----------------------+---------------------------+-------+---------
Bottled Water | | 67.2 | | 47.3 | % | 6.4 | %

We have two collaborations for our sweet taste program in the commercialization phase. PepsiCo has been licensed rights in the non-alcoholic beverage product categories on a worldwide basis. PepsiCo selected Sweetmyx S617 during the research funding collaborative period and will pay Senomyx royalties for the use of this fructose/sucrose modifier in PepsiCo products during the life of the patent. We have no control over our collaborators’ commercialization decisions regarding new or reformulated products incorporating our flavor ingredients.
 
In addition, Firmenich has rights to use four sweet taste modifiers in food and alcoholic beverage product categories on a worldwide basis. Firmenich has been granted a limited period of exclusivity for three to four years, as determined by the agreement, for selected artificial sweet taste modifiers. Firmenich has selected sucrose modifiers S6973 and S9632 and sucrose/fructose modifier Sweetmyx S617 during the research funding period of our collaboration and they will pay us royalties for the use of these modifiers in Firmenich products during the life of the applicable patents. Additionally, Firmenich has exclusive rights to Sucralose modifier S2383 for use in all product categories. We have no control over our collaborators’ commercialization decisions regarding new or reformulated products incorporating our flavor ingredients.
 
Following the period of exclusivity, we may add sweet taste modifiers to our direct sales portfolio. Because the period of exclusivity has expired for S6973 and S9632, we have added both products to our direct sales portfolio and are currently marketing these sucrose modifiers as Sweetmyx SR69 and Sweetmyx SR96 respectively. 
 
Savory Flavor Program
 
Products from our savory flavor program are designed to enable the reduction or removal of added MSG and/or provide new savory tastes to foods by combining our savory flavor ingredients with other ingredients to create unique new flavors. We have received FEMA GRAS determinations for several of our savory flavor ingredients, including S336 and S807. The Chinese Ministry of Health has granted official regulatory approval in China for S336 and S807, and these flavor ingredients have also received positive reviews by JECFA and regulatory approval in the EU.
 

1 “Other” includes dilutables, other functional beverages and other still beverages.

Our savory flavor program is aimed at flavor ingredients that address a worldwide market for monosodium glutamate (MSG) with a value of $5.1 billion and estimated global demand of 3.16 million metric tons, based on 2016 data.. Additionally, these flavor ingredients may be used to create unique savory flavor systems. The incremental opportunity for the entire savory flavors market segment is projected at $2.4 billion in 2017 global sales. These estimates are based on data from Foodtrending and Ajinomoto Co.
 
We currently have one partner for this program with exclusive rights to our S336 flavor ingredient for virtually all product categories in Asia (except Japan), operating under a retail and ingredient supply-based agreement. This partner also has non-exclusive rights to our S807 flavor ingredient for all food and beverage categories in Asia (except Japan). Outside of the rights exclusively licensed to this partner, we retain the rights for direct sales of all savory flavor ingredients for use in all product categories worldwide.
 
Bitter Blocker Program
 
Our bitter taste blockers are intended to reduce the bitterness associated with certain bitter tastants such as those associated with certain HIS, hydrolyzed proteins, cocoa, caffeine and menthol. These bitter taste blockers may be used in a wide variety of products including tea, nutritional beverages, protein bars, confectionary, ice cream, yogurt, desserts and baked goods. One of our bitter blockers, S6821, has received FEMA GRAS determination and is being commercialized through our direct sales efforts. S6821 has demonstrated activity against bitter tasting foods and beverages that include soy and whey proteins, menthol, caffeine, cocoa, rebaudioside A (component of Stevia) and select actives used in various OTC products. 
 
Cooling Taste Program
 
Our cooling taste agents are intended to improve upon the properties of existing cooling agents with benefits which may include odorless compared to menthol, greater potency or improved temporal sensory profiles. Existing cooling agents include menthol, WS-3, Frescolat ML & MGA, Cooler 1 & 2, and Evercool. These cooling agents may be used in a wide variety of products including tea, flavored waters, confectionary products such as chewing gum and mints, toothpaste and mouthwash. Two cooling ingredients, S2227 and Coolmyx®CL19, have received GRAS determination by the FEMA Expert Panel. We currently have one exclusive partner, Firmenich, operating under an ingredient supply-based agreement with certain royalty payments based on their flavor system sales incorporating these cool flavor ingredients.
Salt Taste Program
 
Our salt taste modifier program is intended to reduce the level of salt contained in packaged food and beverage products. High salt levels are used in a wide variety of products including ready meals, sauces, soups, snack foods, frozen foods, canned foods, dried foods, processed meats and certain baked goods. The cost of salt (sodium chloride) is extremely low but the annual usage of salt in consumer products segment is estimated at 1.6 million metric tons (per K+S Group Financial Report 2016). 
 
We have identified a small group of proteins that meet certain criteria for potentially being involved in salt taste, and we have begun more advanced tests to determine if they function to detect salt. We are currently working with protein candidate targets which are being further evaluated to see if either protein modulates salty taste, which would provide a taste proof-of-concept.

Commercialization Status
 
Through December 31, 2017, eight of our flavor ingredients have been commercialized through one of our collaborators or direct sales customers. This total includes two of our savory flavors, four products from our sweet taste program and a bitter blocker that have been incorporated into packaged food or beverage products. Additionally, a cooling agent has been commercialized in an oral care product. Precise information is limited, primarily due to confidentiality agreements. Based on market intelligence, including the royalty reports we receive from our collaborators and the estimated use level of our flavor ingredients, we estimate that finished products of 26.4 billion eight fluid ounce servings or 1.1 million unit cases of beverages, and 10.2 million metric tons of food products, have been manufactured or prepared using Senomyx’s novel flavor ingredients since inception of commercialization. Our estimates are based on the volume or weight of finished products, which include ready-to-drink beverages and ready-to-eat food products along with the volume of finished beverages and weight of food products which are sold as concentrates and require reconstitution prior to consumption. Historically, these products have been marketed in North America, Latin America, Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia and the Middle East.
Royalty-based Collaborations
 
Our collaborators have commercialized products containing flavor ingredients from four of our programs: sweet taste, savory taste, bitter blocker and cooling taste.
 
Firmenich has exclusive worldwide rights to market S2383, our sucralose modifier, in all food and beverage product categories. Retail products incorporating S2383 are currently being marketed in North America, Latin America, Asia and Europe. Firmenich continues to work with other clients evaluating S2383 in a variety of products.
 
Firmenich has non-exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize our S6973 sucrose modifier for virtually all food and specified beverage categories. Retail products incorporating S6973 are being marketed in the United States, Latin America, Asia, Australia and Africa. These products span a variety of categories including ready-to-drink and powdered beverages, dairy products and baked goods.
 
Firmenich has non-exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize our S9632 sucrose modifier in virtually all food categories and alcoholic beverages. Firmenich has not commercialized S9632 and future commercialization of this sucrose modifier is unlikely based on their focus on other Senomyx sweet taste modifiers
 
Firmenich also has exclusive worldwide rights for a specified period to commercialize our Sweetmyx S617 sucrose and high fructose corn syrup sweet taste modifier in virtually all food categories and alcoholic beverages. Effective in the first quarter of 2018, Firmenich rights to Sweetmyx S617 will become non-exclusive. Firmenich will maintain rights to commercialize the product and will have an obligation to pay royalties for use of the product through the life of the patents. 
 
PepsiCo has exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize Sweetmyx S617 in non-alcoholic beverages during specified periods of time. Effective in the first quarter of 2018, PepsiCo rights to Sweetmyx S617 will become non-exclusive. PepsiCo will maintain rights to commercialize the product and will have an obligation to pay royalties for use of the product through the life of the patents. 
 
Ajinomoto has been introducing products that contain one of our flavor ingredients in several Asian countries including China. Ajinomoto has continued to explore additional opportunities to expand their customer base and the number of product offerings within Asia.
 
Firmenich has exclusive, worldwide rights to S2227 and Coolmyx CL19, our novel cooling ingredients, for use in all product categories. Firmenich has commercialized S2227 in oral care products.
 
Sales and Marketing under Royalty-based Collaborations
 
Under our current collaboration agreements, our collaborators are responsible for sales, marketing, and distribution of any packaged food or beverage product incorporating our flavor ingredients for their own use. As a result, in the past, our flavor ingredients were commercialized without our incurring significant sales, marketing and distribution costs and we expect our collaborators to continue to assume those same responsibilities for the use of any flavor ingredients in fields of use that they have licensed from us. Our current collaborators, Ajinomoto, Firmenich and PepsiCo, are recognized leaders in the sales, marketing and distribution of packaged food, beverage and ingredient products.

Manufacturing under Royalty-based Collaborations
 
Under the majority of our existing collaborative agreements, our collaborator may, in its sole discretion, manufacture directly or through a third party manufacturer the flavor ingredients it licenses from us.
Direct Sales to Flavor Companies
 
Rather than relying solely on royalty-based collaborations for commercialization, we also have a direct sales program to sell certain of our flavor ingredients to flavor companies for their use in the development of proprietary flavor systems for their customers. We also have the ability to sell certain of our flavor ingredients directly to food, beverage, consumer product and pharmaceutical customers. We are marketing these flavor ingredients under the Complimyx® umbrella brand, which we selected to connote the benefits of using these offerings to add value to flavor systems. Additionally, we have developed sub-brands to identify each taste area separately, such as Sweetmyx for our sweet taste modifiers, Savorymyx® for our savory flavors and Bittermyx® for our bitter blocker. Specific ingredients within a taste category are referenced using a category code, such as Sweetmyx SR69 which is also known as the sucrose modifier S6973.
 
Our Complimyx product portfolio currently includes five flavor ingredients, all of which are currently being evaluated and sampled to consumer products companies. All five ingredients have been purchased by our flavor company customers for use in consumer products currently on the market. 
 
Sweetmyx SR69 (S6973) and Sweetmyx SR96, sucrose modifiers, amplify the sweetness of sugar-reduced foods and beverage products. . According to Euromonitor, global use of sucrose across all food categories is approximately 28.6 million metric tons on an annual basis. Key targeted food categories for using Sweetmyx SR69, including baked goods, confectionary, dairy products and sweet sauces and condiments, represent around 65% of this volume. The average sucrose content of targeted food products, anticipated use level of Sweetmyx SR69 and the potential sucrose reduction level vary considerably by product category, making it difficult to calculate a generalized dollar value of direct sales revenue for each global market share point achieved. We estimate that our current regulatory approvals allow for the commercialization of Sweetmyx SR69 in over 90% of the target market opportunity.
 
Primary market potential for Sweetmyx SR96 includes a number of targeted non-alcoholic beverage product categories, including ready-to-drink and powdered forms of coffee and tea, powdered soft drinks, flavored milk and dairy beverages. According to Euromonitor, these target product categories utilize over 5.0 million metric tons of sucrose on an annual basis. Based on our assumptions for average sucrose content of the targeted beverages, the anticipated use level of Sweetmyx SR96 and our anticipated selling price to flavor companies, we estimate that each global market share point is worth over $7.7 million to us in direct sales revenues. Furthermore, based on Euromonitor data, we estimate that our current regulatory approvals allow for the commercialization of Sweetmyx SR96 in approximately 77% of the target market opportunity at this time.
 
Sweetmyx FS22, a fructose and sucrose modifier, allows for a significant reduction of both sucrose and high fructose corn syrup while still maintaining great taste. In addition, it has improved physical properties over our existing sweet taste boosters, making it easier to use in end consumer products. Sweetmyx FS22 received FEMA GRAS determination in 2017, enabling commercialization in the U.S. and a number of other countries. Third parties are currently evaluating this novel flavor for potential use in non-alcoholic beverages and other product categories. 
 
Savorymyx UM80 (S807) provides a well-rounded, clean upfront umami or savory note and has been incorporated into a variety of products including sauces, snack foods, soups, frozen foods and beverages. Savorymyx UM33 (S336), a flavor that offers intense slightly delayed savory taste while heightening peppery and earthy notes, is included in our direct sales portfolio for sales outside of Asia (except Japan).
 
 15


We estimate the direct sales potential of Savorymyx UM80 based on the global MSG market. According to Ajinomoto Co. estimates, 2016 MSG global demand was 3.16 million metric tons. Based on our assumptions for average MSG content, the anticipated use level of Savorymyx UM80 and our anticipated selling price to flavor companies, we estimate that each global market share point is worth over $2.5 million to us in direct sales revenues. Our estimate does not include direct sales revenues from the $2.4 billion global savory flavors market. We estimate that our current regulatory approvals allow for the commercialization of Savorymyx UM80 in over 90% of the target market opportunity.
 
Bittermyx BB68 (S6821), a bitter blocker, reduces or blocks bitter taste of numerous ingredients such as hydrolyzed soy and whey proteins, menthol, caffeine, cocoa, and rebaudioside A (component of Stevia) and can improve the overall flavor of foods and beverages. Product applications for Bittermyx BB68 include various food and beverages, over-the-counter medications, pharmaceuticals and oral care products.
 
Sales and Marketing under Direct Sales Program
 
We have developed sales and marketing capabilities within our internal organization to support our direct sales program. Our initial focus is directed toward global flavor companies with operations in the United States and other U.S. based flavor companies. Flavor companies commercialize our flavor ingredients in the United States. Additionally, global flavor companies commercialize our flavor ingredients outside the United States in geographies where we have appropriate regulatory authorization, and in the future we may also market our flavor ingredients directly to more region specific flavor companies outside the United States. In 2017, we established a an agreement with a third party to market and sell certain of our flavor ingredients to flavor companies in the Asia Pacific region.
Manufacturing under Direct Sales Program
 
We utilize third party manufacturers to produce our flavor ingredients. These third parties are responsible for the purchase of raw materials and manufacture of finished products. We may also utilize third parties to provide inventory warehousing, distribution, importation, and other supply chain support.
Our Collaborative Agreements
 
We have established collaborations with leaders in the packaged food, beverage and ingredient supply markets. Under each of our current collaborative agreements, we have agreed to conduct research and develop flavor ingredients in one or more specified taste areas, such as sweet, savory, bitter, cool or salt. These collaborations are generally focused on one or more specific product categories, such as non-alcoholic beverages, confectionary products or frozen foods. We currently have collaborative agreements with Ajinomoto, Firmenich and PepsiCo.
 
Our current collaboration agreements generally provide for royalty payments in the event the collaborator commercializes a product incorporating our flavor ingredients. The specific type of royalty and method for calculating royalty payments varies by agreement and many factors may affect the potential royalty payments under our agreements. In addition, royalty rates under some of our agreements may vary from period to period. Accordingly, any estimates of future royalties are uncertain and difficult to predict. We generally describe our collaborative agreements as retail-based agreements or ingredient supply-based agreements. Under our retail-based royalty agreements, any potential royalty payable to us is calculated as a percentage of the net sales price of a manufacturer’s finished products at the distribution level or is based on the volume of a manufacturer’s finished product that it sells. Our retail-based royalty agreements generally provide for an effective royalty of up to 4%. Our agreements with PepsiCo (Sweet) and Ajinomoto are partially retail-based royalty agreements. Under our ingredient supply-based agreements, any potential royalty payable to us is calculated as a percentage of the sales price of either our flavor ingredient itself or the flavor system in which our flavor ingredient is contained or is based on the volume of the flavor ingredient itself used by a manufacturer in a finished product. Our ingredient supply royalty agreements specify royalty rates that are typically greater than the rates specified by our retail-based agreements. Our agreements with Ajinomoto, Firmenich and PepsiCo (Sweet) are either exclusively or partially ingredient supply-based royalty agreements.
 
 16


Most of our collaboration agreements provide for research and development funding, milestone payments upon achievement of pre-defined research or development targets and cost reimbursement. Certain of our collaboration agreements also provided for license fees and minimum periodic royalties. The research and development funding under each of these agreements is typically paid according to a fixed payment schedule, but may vary from period to period upon mutual agreement of the parties. Each of these collaborations provides us with a portion of the funding we require to pursue the discovery and development of flavor ingredients for the applicable program. Under each of these agreements, we are primarily responsible for the discovery and development phases and any associated expenses, while our collaborator is primarily responsible for selecting the products that may incorporate our flavor ingredients. Under most of our agreements, our collaborator is also responsible for manufacturing, marketing, selling and distributing any of these products for their own use, and any associated expenses. Under our agreements, we are primarily responsible for the development and regulatory approval phase for flavor ingredients, as well as the prosecution and maintenance of the underlying intellectual property for our flavor ingredients, and a portion of the associated expenses for all of those activities.
 
We believe our collaborations will allow us to benefit from our collaborators’ well-established brand recognition, global market presence, established sales and distribution channels and other industry-specific expertise. Each of our collaborations is governed by a joint steering committee, consisting of an equal number of representatives of the collaborator and us. The steering committees provide strategic direction and establish performance criteria for the research, development and commercialization of our flavor ingredients. In most instances, decisions of the steering committees must be unanimous.
 
Our current collaborative agreements provide that we will conduct research and development relating to HIS and/or flavor ingredients for use within clearly defined packaged food, beverage and ingredient product fields, historically on an exclusive or co-exclusive basis for the collaborator during the collaborative period specified in each of the agreements. Collaborations we have established since 2013 have been for non-exclusive rights or with a first mover advantage which provides the collaborator with a limited period of exclusivity. We anticipate that future collaborative agreements we establish will be on a non-exclusive or limited first mover advantage basis. Our current product discovery and development collaborators are not prohibited from entering into research and development collaboration agreements with third parties in any product field. Under the terms of each agreement, we will retain rights to flavor ingredients that we discover during the collaboration for use with the collaborator, or for our use with other collaborators and direct sales customers outside of the defined product fields of that agreement. We will also generally retain rights to any flavor ingredients that we discover after the respective collaborative period. However, in some instances we have agreed to arrangements where we would not launch competing products that one of our collaborators has selected for development and commercialization. We have also agreed under the terms of two of our collaboration agreements that we would not license similar flavor ingredients to the collaborator’s competitor for the same intended uses and product categories that we have licensed to our collaborator. In addition to the collaborative agreements, we have a commercialization and license agreement with Firmenich regarding our S2383 sucralose modifier. In the case of certain of our agreements, if the collaborator terminates the agreement or fails after a reasonable time following regulatory authorization or FEMA GRAS determination to incorporate one or more of our flavor ingredients into a product, such collaborator will no longer be entitled to use the flavor ingredient and we will have the right to sell or license the flavor ingredient to other packaged food, beverage and ingredient companies for use in any product field covered in the agreement.
 
Most of our agreements expire when we are no longer entitled to royalty payments under the agreement. We are typically entitled to royalty payments during the patent life associated with our product. In addition, each agreement may be terminated earlier by mutual agreement or by either party in the event of a breach by the other party of its obligations under the agreement. Furthermore, following the collaborative research period under a given agreement, our collaborators may elect to discontinue the commercialization of one of our flavor ingredients and unilaterally terminate the agreement. In the event of termination of an agreement prior to expiration, rights to sell or license flavor ingredients generally revert to us.

Key Collaborative Agreements
 
Firmenich (Sweet)
 
In July 2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Firmenich to work for a minimum two-year collaborative period to discover novel flavor ingredients intended to modify the sweet taste of sucrose, fructose, or various forms of rebaudioside (components of Stevia). The agreement included three consecutive options to extend the collaborative research funding period by one year each. Under the agreement, Firmenich agreed to pay a license fee in three installments, research and development fees, cost reimbursements and specified payments upon the achievement of milestones. In January 2010, Firmenich elected to proceed with commercial development of S6973. In October 2010, we amended the agreement with Firmenich to include commercial development of S6973 for specific beverage applications in exchange for an incremental license fee, additional milestones and minimum annual royalties, in addition to royalties on sales of products containing S6973. In February 2011, Firmenich elected to exercise their first one-year option to extend the collaborative research funding period through July 2012. In April 2012, Firmenich elected to exercise their second one-year option to extend the collaborative research funding period through July 2013. In April 2013, we amended and restated the collaboration agreement with Firmenich to extend the collaborative research period through July 2016. Firmenich agreed to pay an additional non-refundable license fee of $5 million, of which $4 million was paid in 2013 and $1 million was paid in 2016.
 
Under this agreement, through December 31, 2017, we have received $58.6 million in license fees, research and development funding, cost reimbursements and milestones. We are entitled to receive royalties on future net sales of products containing a discovered flavor ingredient from the date of introduction of each product in each country until the expiration of relevant patents. Any future royalties under this collaboration are uncertain and difficult to predict. 
 
PepsiCo (Sweet)
 
In August 2010, we entered into a collaboration agreement with PepsiCo. The agreement relates to a four-year research program to discover and develop (i) novel natural and artificial flavor ingredients intended to modify the sweet taste of sucrose and fructose, including high fructose corn syrup, and (ii) natural HIS, in each case for use in non-alcoholic beverage product categories on a worldwide basis. Under the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $30.0 million from PepsiCo, $7.5 million of which was paid in the second quarter of 2010 in connection with the signing of a letter agreement between the parties and $22.5 million of which was paid in the third quarter of 2010. We received $32.0 million in research and development payments over the initial four-year research period, which ended in August 2014. In May 2014, PepsiCo exercised its option to extend the research period for an additional two years through August 2016. We received $17.6 million in research and development payments over the two-year research period extension. 
 
In August 2015, we announced that the first commercialization of our flavor ingredient Sweetmyx S617 was achieved, triggering a $1.5 million commercial milestone under our collaboration with PepsiCo. Following commercialization, we are entitled to receive minimum annual royalties into the first quarter of 2018 and/or royalty payments on products that incorporate selected flavor ingredients and/or natural HIS. Royalties on products sold by PepsiCo or its affiliates that incorporate a selected flavor ingredient will be equal to a base amount plus a portion of the cost savings, if any, derived from the use of the flavor ingredient in the applicable product. PepsiCo or its affiliates will also pay royalties on products which incorporate a selected natural HIS. PepsiCo has the unilateral right to terminate the agreement in the event that a direct competitor of PepsiCo acquires more than 30% of our outstanding voting securities.
 
In July 2016, the research period under the agreement was extended by mutual consent for an additional 45 days through September 2016 at the then-current research funding rate, whereby we received $1.1 million in research and development payments.
 
In September 2016, we announced that we entered into an Amended and Restated Collaborative Research, Development, Commercialization and License Agreement with PepsiCo, Inc. effective as of September 30, 2016. The agreement extends PepsiCo’s research funding for our natural sweet taste program for an additional three years, through September 2019. The research program has been broadened to include the screening and evaluation of plant extracts and plant fractionations owned by PepsiCo in addition to our own natural botanical library. 
 
Research and Development Funding: Under the agreement, we will receive $18.0 million in research and development payments, payable in equal quarterly installments over the three year research period. In addition, PepsiCo has also agreed to reimburse us for certain specified out-of-pocket expenses that we may incur during the course of the research program.
 
 18


Extension Option and Termination Rights: PepsiCo has the option to extend the natural sweet taste research program for two additional years, which would result in additional research funding commitments and payments during the extension of the research program.  Quarterly research and development funding will increase by 10% during the period of extension. Both parties have the right to terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach and PepsiCo also has the unilateral right to terminate the agreement in the event that a direct competitor of PepsiCo acquires more than 30% of our outstanding voting securities.
 
Rights: PepsiCo will have non-exclusive rights for commercial development of natural sweeteners and natural sweet enhancers discovered, developed and selected under the collaboration for use in all non-alcoholic beverage categories on a worldwide basis. We will have the right to collaborate with any third party concerning the research, development and commercialization of its natural sweet taste program, except with respect to a key competitor of PepsiCo. We may also not license any selected natural sweet enhancer or natural sweeteners to such key competitor for a period of two years following the receipt of U.S. regulatory approval. We have immediate rights to collaborate with any third party concerning the research, development and commercialization of its synthetic sweet taste program. PepsiCo will maintain their existing rights to any sweet enhancer selected prior to the Amended and Restated Collaborative Agreement effective date. 
 
Milestones/Royalties: We will also be eligible for milestone payments based on the achievement of predetermined goals as well as royalty payments upon the sale of products containing natural sweeteners or natural sweet enhancers selected under the collaboration. If a selected natural sweetener or natural sweet enhancer is discovered solely through PepsiCo’s natural library, PepsiCo will be entitled to a reduction in the royalty payable to us and to receive a royalty on our commercial revenues generated by such selected ingredient.
 
Under this agreement, through December 31, 2017, we have received $95.7 million in upfront fees, research and development funding, cost reimbursements and milestones. We are entitled to receive an additional $10.5 million for the remaining research and development funding under the agreement. There is no guarantee that we will receive any additional milestone payments under this collaboration. We are entitled to receive royalties on future net sales of products containing a discovered flavor ingredient from the date of introduction of each product in each country until the expiration of relevant patents. Any future royalties under this collaboration are uncertain and difficult to predict. If our collaborative agreement with PepsiCo were to terminate earlier than currently anticipated, we may experience a material decline in our revenues.
 
Firmenich (Cool)
 
In December 2007, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Firmenich to work for a three-year collaborative period to discover and develop novel flavor ingredients that may be used by Firmenich on an exclusive basis worldwide to impart a cool taste in flavor systems. In November 2010, we amended the agreement to extend the collaborative period until December 2012. In December 2012, we amended the agreement to extend the collaborative period until June 2013, which marked the end of the collaborative period. Under the agreement, Firmenich agreed to pay research fees and specified payments upon the achievement of milestones. Firmenich also agreed to reimburse us for a portion of the costs associated with the development and regulatory approval process of flavor ingredients that it selects for development, as well as a portion of certain expenses that we incur related to the research program. In addition, based on the regulatory approval in 2014 of a discovered flavor ingredient, we are entitled to minimum periodic royalties and royalties on sales of products containing the discovered flavor ingredient until the expiration of relevant patents. In November 2017, we amended the agreement to grant Firmenich an exclusive license to an additional approved flavor ingredient (Coolmyx CL19) and related analogs, as well as an expansion of product categories to include all applications in the flavor, oral care and consumer product markets. In addition, Firmenich’s royalty obligations were suspended from 2018 through 2020 and will resume on January 1, 2021. In exchange for the exclusive license, expansion of rights and suspension of royalty obligations, we received a cash payment of $10.0 million.
 
Under this agreement, through December 31, 2017, we have received $19.5 million in research and development funding, cost reimbursements, milestones, license fees and royalty pre-payments. We are entitled to receive royalties on future net sales of products containing a discovered flavor ingredient beginning in 2021 until the expiration of relevant patents. Any future royalties under this collaboration are uncertain and difficult to predict.

Other Collaborative Agreements
 Ajinomoto
 
In March 2006, we entered into a collaborative research, development, commercialization and license agreement with Ajinomoto for the discovery and commercialization of novel flavor ingredients on an exclusive basis in the soup, sauce and culinary aids, and noodle product categories, and on a co-exclusive basis in the bouillon product category within certain Asian markets. Under the terms of the initial collaboration, Ajinomoto agreed to pay us an upfront license fee and research and development funding for up to three years. In addition, we are eligible to receive milestone payments upon achievement of specific product discovery and development goals and reimbursement for certain expenses that we incur. In April 2007, we amended the agreement to expand Ajinomoto’s rights into North America. In August 2007, we further amended the agreement to expand Ajinomoto’s rights into additional product categories and geographies that were not previously licensed by us. In January 2013, Ajinomoto relinquished and returned to us the rights to the previously licensed flavor ingredients in North America and in the other geographies granted in the August 2007 amendment. Ajinomoto is continuing to commercialize products that include one of our flavor ingredients in Asia. We received research and development funding through March 2010. In addition, we have received milestone payments, cost reimbursements and minimum periodic royalty payments from Ajinomoto. Any future royalties under this collaboration are uncertain and difficult to predict.
Firmenich (Sucralose)
 
In November 2008, we entered into a second collaboration agreement with Firmenich for S2383, our novel modifier of the high intensity sweetener sucralose. Under the agreement, Firmenich has agreed to pay to us royalty payments based on sales of S2383 when it is sold on either a stand-alone basis or within a flavor system. We have received royalty payments under this collaboration. Any future royalties under this collaboration are uncertain and difficult to predict.
Competition
 
Our goal is to be the leader in discovering novel flavor ingredients for use in a wide range of packaged food, beverage and ingredient products. Other companies are possibly pursuing similar technologies and the commercialization of products and services relevant to flavor ingredients. Although we are not aware of any other companies that have the scope of proprietary technologies and processes that we have developed in our field, there are a number of competitors who possess capabilities relevant to the flavor ingredient field.
 
In particular, we face substantial competition from companies pursuing the commercialization of products and services relevant to taste using more traditional methods for the discovery of flavor ingredients, or for the reduction of salt, sugar, monosodium glutamate, or MSG, or bitter taste. These competitors include leading flavor companies, such as Firmenich, Givaudan SA, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Symrise and Takasago. These companies provide flavors and other products, such as oils, extracts and distillates, to consumer products companies for use in a wide variety of products including foods, beverages, confectionaries, dairy products and pharmaceuticals. Competitors currently developing or marketing HIS include Ajinomoto, BRAIN, AnalytiCon and Roquette: consortium Dolce AG, Cargill, DSM, Evolva, GLG Life Tech, Natur Research Ingredients, Nutrasweet, Nutrinova GMBH, PureCircle Limited, Symrise and Tate & Lyle. Competitors currently developing or marketing menthol or cooling agents include International Flavors and Fragrances, Givaudan, Jindal Drugs, Mentha & Allied, Sharp Menthol, Symrise, Takasago and BASF. We will continue to compete in the future with these companies in collaborating with and selling flavor ingredients and technologies to manufacturers of food, beverage and ingredient products. Many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources, research and development resources and experience, manufacturing capabilities, regulatory expertise, sales and marketing resources, and more established relationships with consumer products companies than we do.

We may in the future face competition from life sciences and other technology companies and other commercial enterprises. These entities engage as we do in biotechnology, biology or chemistry and could apply this technology to the discovery and development of flavor ingredients. We are aware of another company, Chromocell, Inc., that is involved in research for the discovery and development of sweet enhancers and salt substitutes. Products developed as a result of our competitors’ existing or future collaborations may compete with our flavor ingredients.
 
Universities and public and private research institutions are also potential competitors. While these organizations primarily have educational objectives, they may develop proprietary technologies related to the sense of taste or secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products. We may attempt to license these proprietary technologies, but these licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
Methods for reducing sodium include the use of potassium chloride in combination with flavors and masking agents. Although savory flavor enhancers are commercially available, they are not very potent, are not patent protected and are sold as a commodity. The blocking of bitter taste is typically accomplished by attempting to mask the bitter taste with a sweetener or another flavor ingredient. Existing cooling agents, such as menthol and WS-3, are currently in use. However, our competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing technologies or discovering flavor ingredients that are similar or preferable in the areas of, among others, effectiveness, safety, cost and ease of commercialization, and our competitors may obtain intellectual property protection or commercialize such products sooner than we do. Developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete. In addition, our current product discovery and development collaborators are not prohibited from entering into research and development agreements with third parties in any particular field.
