Item 1. Corporate History 
 
Source Financial, Inc. (the “Company”), formerly known as Wiki Group, Inc., was incorporated on June 24, 1988 under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name Windsor Capital Corp.
 
In February 2008, we became an internet person-to-person lending service as a result of our acquisition from Spider Investments, LLC, of all right, title and interest in and to www.swapadebt.com, a person-to-person lending website, in consideration for shares of our common stock.   
 
On May 4, 2011, we authorized a 10- for-1 forward split of our common stock and increased the number of our authorized shares of common stock to 750,000,000.  On July 31, 2011, we authorized a 1-for-10 reverse stock split and reduced the number of our authorized shares of common stock to 150,000,000.
 
On February 6, 2012, we increased the number of our authorized shares of common stock to 250,000,000.
 
On February 10, 2012, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of WikiPay, Inc., in exchange for shares of our Series A Preferred Stock convertible into sixty percent (60%) of our then outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis.
 
On December 7, 2012, we increased the number of our authorized shares of common stock to 500,000,000. 
 
On March 21, 2013, we effected a 1-for-100 reverse split of our authorized and issued common stock and changed our corporate name to Source Financial, Inc.
 
On June 30, 2013, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Moneytech Limited, an Australian company (“Moneytech”) pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement dated May 30, 2013 (the “Exchange Agreement”) in exchange, for 5,300,000 shares of our common stock (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Moneytech became a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company, with the Moneytech shareholders owning in excess of 50% of our outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis.
 
In connection with our acquisition of Moneytech, we issued 5,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock to Hugh Evans, the Chairman and Managing Director of Moneytech. The holder of the Series B Shares has the right, until June 30, 2018, to (A) elect the majority of our Board of Directors and (B) vote on all other matters presented to the holders of common stock (the “Common Shareholders”), with each Series B Share having a number of votes equal to 1,000 shares of common stock. After June 30, 2018, the Series B Shares will have no voting rights and we will have the right to purchase the Series B Shares at a per share price equal to one tenth of a cent ($0.001).  As the holder of the Series B Shares, Mr. Evans will be able to elect a majority of our Board of Directors until June 30, 2018, and as the holder of a majority of our outstanding voting shares, Mr. Evans has effective control over our business, including matters requiring the approval of our stockholders, such as the approval of significant corporate transactions.
 
In connection with the Share Exchange, our two principal stockholders prior to consummation of the share exchange deposited in escrow an aggregate of 2,240,000 shares of our common stock , and we deposited in escrow all outstanding shares of the common stock of WikiTechnologies, Inc. (“WTI”) our only operating subsidiary prior to the Share Exchange. The terms of the escrow arrangement were such that if WikiTechnologies failed to achieve certain financial benchmarks we could elect to retain the Escrow Shares by delivering the WTI Escrow Shares to the two stockholders.
 
On October 3, 2013, we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to decrease the number of our authorized shares of common stock and preferred stock to 50,000,000 and 1,000,000, respectively.

Our Business
 
A serial entrepreneur and venture investor, Edward C. DeFeudis, with more than twenty years of experience, founded Venture Track. Since 1995, he has helped launch numerous private and public companies, including Wiki Technologies, Inc., and has received major financing commitments to help fund companies, startups and product launches. Throughout his career, Mr. DeFeudis has primarily been engaged in the development of strategic partnerships and financial strategies.
 
Through Venture Track, Mr. DeFeudis is leveraging his experience and resources in capital markets and Internet marketing to provide an innovative accelerator program and crowdfunding platform for early-stage disruptive technology companies.
 
Headquartered in Santa Monica, CA, we operate throughout key markets in the United States. Our corporate office is located at 604 Arizona Ave, Santa Monica, CA 90401, and our telephone is (424) 322-2201.
 
Business Overview
 
Upon completion of the merger with CSES, the business overview is highly probably to change.
 
The Company focuses on identifying, financing, developing, and deploying technology. We own www.scoocher.com, an online content monetization engine and we have a definitive agreement in place to merge with CSES Group, Inc., owner and producer of Alltemp®, an eco-friendly refrigerant replacement for R-22, 410a and others. The Company’s initial focus is to finalize the merger with CSES Group, and continue to develop and deploy the Scoocher app as an in-house project (“Phase 1”).
 
The Company recognizes the unique opportunity that exists in today’s app market. There are thousands of apps that have been financed, built and deployed, but the founders of these apps do not possess the wherewithal to market the apps successfully. In many cases, the apps are available for sale at a fraction of the development cost. It is the Company’s intention to identify, purchase and deploy select apps with the greatest market potential (“Phase 2”).
 
The Venture Track Program first aims to fund the launch of revenue ready apps and start-ups (“Innovators”) through bridge loans. Then the Venture Track Program aims to market the apps, determine the true customer acquisition cost, fine-tune their projections and use of proceeds, and set them on a track for a public offering facilitated through equity crowdfunding (“Phase 3”).

The Venture Track Program 
 
The Company intends on offering a three-phase, two-year program, for revenue ready Innovators. The three stages are: 1) Market Preparation, 2) Public Crowdfunding, and 3) Graduation.
 
In order for Innovators to be accepted into the program, each must: 1) solve an obvious problem or make an existing solution much more efficient; 2) be scalable; 3) have a focused team; and 4) be ready to generate revenue with a small capital infusion.
 
We are seeking to accept 29 Innovators into the program over the course of our first three (3) years: five (5) Innovators in year one (1), eight (8) in year two (2), and sixteen (16) in year three (3).
 
We will receive approximately 10-30% seed-stage sweat-equity in each Innovator, a portion of which may be distributed as dividends to shareholders based upon rules to be determined by the Board of Directors.
 
Investment capital offered by the Company in the Market Preparation stage may be in the form of a 506c Regulation A+ offering and bridge loan. The bridge loan amount is expected average $200,000, which shall be used by Innovators for general operating, legal, accounting, advertising, marketing expenses related to filing a Regulation A+ offering.
 
Upon approval of the Regulation A+ offering, the Innovator shall move to the Public Crowdfunding stage. We will advertise and market the offering to the public through equity crowdfunding, primarily to accredited investors, angels, venture capital firms, and broker dealers. The Regulation A+ registration statement will offer a maximum of $50,000,000 in equity to investors. We will retain the first right to sell its holdings in the Regulation A+ offering.
 
Upon the completion of the Regulation A+ offering, the Innovator will move to the Graduation stage. In this stage, we will continue to mentor the Innovator to manage its growth and begin the process of introducing the company to 1) registered broker dealers with the intent of uplisting the Innovator to a national exchange, 2) strategic acquirers and/or merger candidates, and 3) strategic buyers.
 
Target Market
 
Our target market is focused on early-stage technology companies that are seeking funding, business development, and access to equity crowdfunding as designated under the JOBS Act.
Revenue Sources 
 
We plan on generating most of our revenue from the Venture Track Program as set forth above.
 
We plan on revamping the Venturetrack.net website within the next few months.
 
Competition
 
Today, incubators and accelerators are a fixture in the tech community and there are more than 200 programs across the US. We are unique, and are keenly focused on leveraging the opportunities offered under the JOBS Act to bring Innovators to market as fast as possible.
 
The incubators and accelerators industry is highly competitive, and continues to evolve as a result of changes in regulation, technology, product delivery systems, and the general market and economic climate. Our competitors include other incubators and accelerators, banks, debt funds and specialty and diversified financial services intermediaries that offer lending, leasing, payments, investment, foreign currency exchange, advisory and other financial products and services to our target client base. We also compete with other lenders, such as “marketplace” lenders, peer-to-peer lenders and other non-traditional lenders that have merged in recent years. In addition, we compete with hedge funds and private equity funds. The principal competitive factors in our markets include product offerings, service, pricing, and transaction size and structure.

There are many companies who compete directly with our products and services, for example, AngelPad, MuckerLab, TechStars and StartX, etc. These companies may already have an established market in our industry. Most of these companies have significantly greater financial and other resources than us and have been developing their products and services longer than we have been developing ours. Additionally, there are no significant barriers to entry in our industry and new companies may be created that will compete with us and other, more established companies who do not now directly compete with us, may choose to enter our markets and compete with us in the future.
