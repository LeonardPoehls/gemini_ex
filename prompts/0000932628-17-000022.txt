ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General
AmeriGas Partners, L.P. is a publicly traded limited partnership formed under Delaware law on November 2, 1994. We are the largest retail propane distributor in the United States based on the volume of propane gallons distributed annually. The Partnership serves over 1.8 million residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, wholesale and motor fuel customers in all 50 states from approximately 1,900 propane distribution locations.
We are a holding company and we conduct our business principally through our subsidiary, AmeriGas Propane, L.P. (“AmeriGas OLP”), a Delaware limited partnership. AmeriGas OLP is referred to herein as “the Operating Partnership.” Our common units (“Common Units”), which represent limited partner interests, are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “APU.” Our executive offices are located at 460 North Gulph Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, and our telephone number is (610) 337-7000. In this Report, the terms “Partnership” and “AmeriGas Partners,” as well as the terms “our,” “we,” and “its,” are used sometimes as abbreviated references to AmeriGas Partners, L.P. itself or collectively, AmeriGas Partners, L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. The terms “Fiscal 2017,” “Fiscal 2016,” and “Fiscal 2015” refer to the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, respectively.
AmeriGas Propane, Inc. is our general partner (the “General Partner”) and is responsible for managing our operations. The General Partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of UGI Corporation (“UGI”), a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The General Partner has an approximate 26% effective ownership interest in the Partnership.

Business Strategy
Our strategy is to grow by (i) developing internal sales and marketing programs to improve customer service and attract and retain customers, (ii) leveraging our scale and driving productivity, and (iii) pursuing opportunistic acquisitions. We regularly consider and evaluate opportunities for growth through the acquisition of local, regional, and national propane distributors. We compete for acquisitions with others engaged in the propane distribution business. During Fiscal 2017, we completed the acquisition of five propane distribution businesses. We expect that internal growth will be provided in part from the continued expansion of our AmeriGas Cylinder Exchange (“ACE”) program, through which consumers can purchase propane cylinders or exchange propane cylinders at various retail locations, and our National Accounts program, through which we encourage multi-location propane users to enter into a supply agreement with us rather than with multiple suppliers. During Fiscal 2017, we continued to make significant investments in technology to reduce operational costs while improving our customers’ experience. For example, (i) we rolled out the AmeriMobile distribution platform to all district locations, increasing the use of technology to more efficiently deploy our drivers in making deliveries to customers and (ii) we continue to promote a customer service culture through the development of our on-line customer experience, which enables customers to transact with us after hours, to seek customer support through live on-line chat, and to receive delivery confirmations by text.

Products, Services and Marketing
The Partnership serves over 1.8 million customers in all 50 states from approximately 1,900 propane distribution locations. In addition to distributing propane, the Partnership also sells, installs and services propane appliances, including heating systems, and operates a residential heating, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, and related services business in certain counties of Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. Typically, the Partnership’s propane distribution locations are in suburban and rural areas where natural gas is not readily available. Our local offices generally consist of a business office and propane storage. As part of its overall transportation and distribution infrastructure, the Partnership operates as an interstate carrier throughout the continental U.S. 
The Partnership sells propane primarily to residential, commercial/industrial, motor fuel, agricultural and wholesale customers. The Partnership distributed approximately 1.1 billion gallons of propane in Fiscal 2017. Approximately 96% of the Partnership’s Fiscal 2017 sales (based on gallons sold) were to retail accounts and approximately 4% were to wholesale and supply customers. Sales to residential customers in Fiscal 2017 represented approximately 37% of retail gallons sold; commercial/industrial customers 38%; motor fuel customers 17%; and agricultural customers 4%. Transport gallons, which are large-scale deliveries to retail customers other than residential, accounted for 4% of Fiscal 2017 retail gallons. No single customer represents, or is anticipated to represent, more than 5% of the Partnership’s consolidated revenues.
The Partnership continues to expand its AmeriGas Cylinder Exchange (“ACE”) program. At September 30, 2017, ACE cylinders were available at over 50,000 retail locations throughout the U.S. Sales of our ACE cylinders to retailers are included in commercial/industrial sales. The ACE program enables consumers to purchase or exchange propane cylinders at various retail locations such as home centers, gas stations, mass merchandisers and grocery and convenience stores. We also supply retailers with large propane tanks to enable retailers to replenish customers’ propane cylinders directly at the retailer’s location.
Residential and commercial customers use propane primarily for home heating, water heating and cooking purposes. Commercial users include hotels, restaurants, churches, warehouses, and retail stores. Industrial customers use propane to fire furnaces, as a cutting gas and in other process applications. Other industrial customers are large-scale heating accounts and local gas utility customers who use propane as a supplemental fuel to meet peak load deliverability requirements. As a motor fuel, propane is burned in internal combustion engines that power school buses and other over-the-road vehicles, forklifts, and stationary engines. Agricultural uses include tobacco curing, chicken brooding, crop drying, and orchard heating. In its wholesale operations, the Partnership principally sells propane to large industrial end-users and other propane distributors.

Retail deliveries of propane are usually made to customers by means of bobtail and rack trucks. Propane is pumped from the bobtail truck, which generally holds 2,400 to 3,000 gallons of propane, into a stationary storage tank on the customer’s premises. The Partnership owns most of these storage tanks and leases them to its customers. The capacity of these tanks ranges from approximately 120 gallons to approximately 1,200 gallons. The Partnership also delivers propane in portable cylinders, including ACE and motor fuel cylinders. Some of these deliveries are made to the customer’s location, where cylinders are either picked up or replenished in place.
Propane Supply and Storage
The United States propane market has over 250 domestic and international sources of supply, including the spot market. Supplies of propane from the Partnership’s sources historically have been readily available. Volatility in the U.S. propane market stabilized in Fiscal 2017 and the propane industry experienced normal inventory levels, following record high levels reached in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. The availability and pricing of propane supply is dependent upon, among other things, the severity of winter weather, the price and availability of competing fuels such as natural gas and crude oil, and the amount and availability of exported supply and, to a much lesser extent, imported supply. In recent years, there has been an increase in overseas demand for U.S. propane exports as the U.S. continues to have low cost reliable sources of propane. We utilized our extensive distribution and logistics channels to minimize disruption to our customers due to supply chain interruptions resulting from the natural disasters in Fiscal 2017, including Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the wildfires in California.

During Fiscal 2017, approximately 95% of the Partnership’s propane supply was purchased under supply agreements with terms of 1 to 3 years. Although no assurance can be given that supplies of propane will be readily available in the future, management currently expects to be able to secure adequate supplies during Fiscal 2018. If supply from major sources were interrupted, however, the cost of procuring replacement supplies and transporting those supplies from alternative locations might be materially higher and, at least on a short-term basis, margins could be adversely affected. Plains Marketing, L.P. and Targa Liquids Marketing & Trade LLC supplied approximately 28% of the Partnership’s Fiscal 2017 propane supply. No other single supplier provided more than 10% of the Partnership’s total propane supply in Fiscal 2017. In certain geographic areas, however, a single supplier provides more than 50% of the Partnership’s requirements. Disruptions in supply in these areas could also have an adverse impact on the Partnership’s margins.
The Partnership’s supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon (i) index formulas using the current prices established at a major storage point such as Mont Belvieu, Texas, or Conway, Kansas, or (ii) posted prices at the time of delivery. In addition, some agreements provide maximum and minimum seasonal purchase volume guidelines. The percentage of contract purchases, and the amount of supply contracted for at fixed prices, will vary from year to year as determined by the General Partner. The Partnership uses a number of interstate pipelines, as well as railroad tank cars, delivery trucks, and barges, to transport propane from suppliers to storage and distribution facilities. The Partnership stores propane at various storage facilities and terminals located in strategic areas across the U.S.
Because the Partnership’s profitability is sensitive to changes in wholesale propane costs, the Partnership generally seeks to pass on increases in the cost of propane to customers. There is no assurance, however, that the Partnership will always be able to pass on product cost increases fully, or keep pace with such increases, particularly when product costs rise rapidly. Product cost increases can be triggered by periods of severe cold weather, supply interruptions, increases in the prices of base commodities such as crude oil and natural gas, or other unforeseen events. The General Partner has adopted supply acquisition and product cost risk management practices to reduce the effect of volatility on selling prices. These practices currently include the use of summer storage, forward purchases and derivative commodity instruments, such as options and propane price swaps. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Market Risk Disclosures.”
The following graph shows the average prices of propane on the propane spot market during the last five fiscal years at Mont Belvieu, Texas and Conway, Kansas, both major storage areas.

Average Propane Spot Market Prices
General Industry Information
Propane is separated from crude oil during the refining process and also extracted from natural gas or oil wellhead gas at processing plants. Propane is normally transported and stored in a liquid state under moderate pressure or refrigeration for economy and ease of handling in shipping and distribution. When the pressure is released or the temperature is increased, it is usable as a flammable gas. Propane is colorless and odorless; an odorant is added to allow for its detection. Propane is considered a clean alternative fuel under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, producing negligible amounts of pollutants when properly consumed.
Competition
Propane competes with other sources of energy, some of which are less costly for equivalent energy value. Propane distributors compete for customers with suppliers of electricity, fuel oil and natural gas, principally on the basis of price, service, availability and portability. Electricity is generally more expensive than propane on a British thermal unit (“Btu”) equivalent basis, but the convenience and efficiency of electricity make it an attractive energy source for consumers and developers of new homes. Fuel oil is also a major competitor of propane but is currently more expensive than propane as well as a less environmentally attractive energy source. Historically, however, fuel oil is less expensive than propane. Furnaces and appliances that burn propane will not operate on fuel oil, and vice versa, and, therefore, a conversion from one fuel to the other requires the installation of new equipment. Propane serves as an alternative to natural gas in rural and suburban areas where natural gas is unavailable or portability of product is required. Natural gas is generally a significantly less expensive source of energy than propane, although in areas where natural gas is available, propane is used for certain industrial and commercial applications and as a fuel during interruptions in natural gas service. The gradual expansion of the nation’s natural gas distribution systems has resulted in the availability of natural gas in some areas that previously depended upon propane. However, natural gas pipelines are not present in many areas of the country where propane is sold for heating and cooking purposes.
For motor fuel customers, propane competes with gasoline, diesel fuel, electric batteries, fuel cells, and, in certain applications, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas. Wholesale propane distribution is a highly competitive, low margin business. Propane sales to other retail distributors and large-volume, direct-shipment industrial end-users are price sensitive and frequently involve a competitive bidding process.
Retail propane industry volumes have been declining for several years and no or modest growth in total demand is foreseen in the next several years. Therefore, the Partnership’s ability to grow within the industry is dependent on its ability to acquire other retail distributors and to achieve internal growth, which includes expansion of the ACE program and the National Accounts program (through which the Partnership encourages multi-location propane users to enter into a single AmeriGas Propane supply agreement rather than agreements with multiple suppliers), as well as the success of its sales and marketing programs designed to attract and retain customers. The failure of the Partnership to retain and grow its customer base would have an adverse effect on its long-term results.

The domestic propane retail distribution business is highly competitive. The Partnership competes in this business with other large propane marketers, including other full-service marketers, and thousands of small independent operators. Some farm cooperatives, rural electric cooperatives, and fuel oil distributors include propane distribution in their businesses and the Partnership competes with them as well. The ability to compete effectively depends on providing high quality customer service, maintaining competitive retail prices and controlling operating expenses. The Partnership also offers customers various payment and service options, including guaranteed price programs, fixed price arrangements and pricing arrangements based on published propane prices at specified terminals.
In Fiscal 2017, the Partnership’s retail propane sales totaled more than 1.0 billion gallons. Based on the most recent annual survey by the American Petroleum Institute, 2015 domestic retail propane sales (annual sales for other than chemical uses) in the U.S. totaled approximately 8.5 billion gallons. Based on LP-GAS magazine rankings, 2015 sales volume of the ten largest propane distribution companies (including AmeriGas Partners) represented approximately 40% of domestic retail sales.
Trade Names, Trade and Service Marks
The Partnership markets propane and other services principally under the “AmeriGas®”, “America’s Propane Company®”, “Heritage Propane®”, “Relationships Matter®”, “Metro Lawn®” and “ServiceMark®” trade names and related service marks. The Partnership also markets propane under various other trade names throughout the United States. UGI owns, directly or indirectly, all the right, title and interest in the “AmeriGas” name and related trade and service marks. The General Partner owns all right, title and interest in the “America’s Propane Company” trade name and related service marks. The Partnership has an exclusive (except for use by UGI, AmeriGas, Inc., AmeriGas Polska Sp. z.o.o. and the General Partner), royalty-free license to use these trade names and related service marks. UGI and the General Partner each have the option to terminate its respective license agreement (except its licenses with permitted transferees and on 12 months prior notice in the case of UGI), without penalty, if the General Partner is removed as general partner of the Partnership for cause. If the General Partner ceases to serve as the general partner of the Partnership other than for cause, the General Partner has the option to terminate its license agreement upon payment of a fee to AmeriGas Propane, L.P. equal to the fair market value of the licensed trade names. UGI has a similar termination option; however, UGI must provide 12 months prior notice in addition to paying the fee to AmeriGas Propane, L.P. UGI and the General Partner each also have the right to terminate its respective license agreement in order to settle any claim of infringement, unfair competition or similar claim or if the agreement has been materially breached without appropriate cure.
Seasonality
Because many customers use propane for heating purposes, the Partnership’s retail sales volume is seasonal. During Fiscal 2017, approximately 64% of the Partnership’s retail sales volume occurred, and substantially all of the Partnership’s operating income was earned, during the peak heating season from October through March. As a result of this seasonality, sales are typically higher in the Partnership’s first and second fiscal quarters (October 1 through March 31). Cash receipts are generally greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the winter heating season.
Sales volume for the Partnership traditionally fluctuates from year-to-year in response to variations in weather, prices, competition, customer mix and other factors, such as conservation efforts and general economic conditions. For information on national weather statistics, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Government Regulation
The Partnership is subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations governing the storage, distribution and transportation of propane and the operation of bulk storage propane terminals. Generally, these laws impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants, establish standards for the handling of solid and hazardous substances, and require the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination. These laws include, among others, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Clean Air Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Clean Water Act, and comparable state statutes. The Partnership incurs expenses associated with compliance with its obligations under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, and we believe that the Partnership is in material compliance with all of its obligations. The Partnership maintains various permits that are necessary to operate its facilities, some of which may be material to its operations. The Partnership continually monitors its operations with respect to potential environmental issues, including changes in legal requirements.
7

Hazardous Substances and Wastes
The Partnership is investigating and remediating contamination at a number of present and former operating sites in the United States, including former sites where it or its former subsidiaries operated manufactured gas plants. CERCLA and similar state laws impose joint and several liability on certain classes of persons considered to have contributed to the release or threatened release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Propane is not a hazardous substance within the meaning of CERCLA.
Health and Safety
The Partnership is subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of its workers.  These laws require the Partnership, among other things, to maintain information about materials, some of which may be hazardous or toxic, that are used, released, or produced in the course of its operations. Certain portions of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and responders, commercial and industrial customers, and local citizens in accordance with applicable federal and state Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requirements. The Partnership’s operations are also subject to the safety hazard communication requirements and reporting obligations set forth in federal workplace standards.
All states in which the Partnership operates have adopted fire safety codes that regulate the storage, distribution, and use of propane. In some states, these laws are administered by state agencies, and in others they are administered on a municipal level. The Partnership conducts training programs to help ensure that its operations are in compliance with applicable governmental regulations. With respect to general operations, the Partnership is subject in all jurisdictions in which it operates to rules and procedures governing the safe handling of propane, including those established by National Fire Protection Association Pamphlets No. 54 and No. 58 and various state, local and international codes (including international fire, building and fuel gas codes). Management believes that the policies and procedures currently in effect at all of its facilities for the handling, storage and distribution, and use of propane are consistent with industry standards and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental, health and safety laws.
With respect to the transportation of propane by truck, the Partnership is subject to regulations promulgated under federal legislation, including the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act, the Hazardous Materials & Transportation Act, and the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Regulations under these statutes cover the security and transportation of hazardous materials, including propane for purposes of these regulations, and are administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). The Natural Gas Safety Act of 1968 required the DOT to develop and enforce minimum safety regulations for the transportation of gases by pipeline. The DOT's pipeline safety regulations apply to, among other things, a propane gas system which supplies 10 or more residential customers or two or more commercial customers from a single source and to a propane gas system any portion of which is located in a public place. The DOT’s pipeline safety regulations require operators of all gas systems to provide operator qualification standards and training and written instructions for employees and third party contractors working on covered pipelines and facilities, establish written procedures to minimize the hazards resulting from gas pipeline emergencies, and conduct and keep records of inspections and testing. Operators are subject to the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. Management believes that the procedures currently in effect at all of the Partnership’s facilities for the handling, storage, transportation and distribution of propane are consistent with industry standards and are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations.
Climate Change
There continues to be concern, both nationally and internationally, about climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, most notably carbon dioxide, to global warming. Because propane is considered a clean alternative fuel under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Partnership anticipates that this will provide it with a competitive advantage over other sources of energy, such as fuel oil and coal, to the extent new climate change regulations become effective. At the same time, increased regulation of GHG emissions, especially in the transportation sector, could impose significant additional costs on the Partnership, its suppliers and its customers. In recent years, there has been an increase in state initiatives aimed at regulating GHG emissions. For example, the California Environmental Protection Agency established a Cap & Trade program that requires certain covered entities, including propane distribution companies, to purchase allowances to compensate for the GHG emissions created by their business operations. The impact of new legislation and regulations will depend on a number of factors, including (i) which industry sectors would be impacted, (ii) the timing of required compliance, (iii) the overall GHG emissions cap level, (iv) the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, and (v) the costs and opportunities associated with compliance.
8

Employees
The Partnership does not directly employ any persons responsible for managing or operating the Partnership. The General Partner provides these services and is reimbursed for its direct and indirect costs and expenses, including all compensation and benefit costs. At September 30, 2017, the General Partner had approximately 8,100 employees, including over 350 part-time, seasonal and temporary employees, working on behalf of the Partnership. UGI also performs certain financial and administrative services for the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership and is reimbursed by the Partnership.
