Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Misonix, Inc. is a New York corporation which, through its predecessors, was first organized in 1959. We design, manufacture, develop and market minimally invasive therapeutic ultrasonic medical devices. Our products enhance clinical outcomes and provide value to the overall healthcare system. Since we commercialized our ultrasonic vessel sealing system with US Surgical in 1996, we have helped create a multi-billion dollar segment within the overall general surgical and gynecological arena. We believe that our current focus products have the ability to become standard of care and provide the Company with a steady recurring revenue stream. 

● | BoneScalpel ® surgical system (“BoneScalpel”), which is used mainly for surgical procedures involving the precise cutting and sculpting of bone while sparing soft tissue. BoneScapel is now recognized by surgeons globally as one of the most important surgical devices enabling improved patient outcomes in the spinal arena.

● | SonaStar ® Surgical Aspirator (“SonaStar”), which is used to emulsify and remove soft and hard tumors, primarily in the neuro and general surgery field.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SonicOne® Wound Cleansing and Debridement System (“SonicOne”), which offers tissue specific debridement and cleansing of wounds and burns for effective removal of devitalized tissue and fibrin deposits while sparing viable cells.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These devices primarily serve the following clinical specialties: neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, wounds and maxillo-facial.
 
In the United States, our products are marketed primarily through a hybrid sales approach. This includes direct sales representatives, managed by regional sales managers and supported by company application specialists, along with independent distributors.
 
Outside the United States, we sell BoneScalpel and SonaStar to specialty distributors who purchase products from us to resell to their clinical customer bases. We sell to all major markets in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Africa and we plan to sell SonicOne into select international markets.
 
Products
 
All Misonix disposables function with proprietary consoles which essentially convert electrical current into ultrasonic energy via piezo electric crystals in order for the relevant device to produce a therapeutic effect.
 
BoneScalpel
 
The BoneScalpel is a state of the art, ultrasonic bone cutting and sculpting system capable of making precise cuts with minimal necrosis, minimal burn artifact, minimal inflammation and minimal bone loss. The device is also capable of preserving surrounding soft tissue structures because of its unique ability to differentiate soft tissue from rigid bone. This device can make precise linear or curved cuts, on any plane, with precision not normally associated with powered instrumentation. The BoneScalpel offers the speed and convenience of a powered instrument without the dangers associated with conventional rotary devices. The effect on surrounding soft tissue is minimal due to the elastic and flexible structure of healthy tissue. This is a significant advantage in anatomical regions like the spine where patient safety is of primary concern. In addition, the linear motion of the blunt, tissue-impacting tips avoids accidental ‘trapping’ of soft tissue while largely eliminating the high speed spinning and tearing associated with rotary power instruments. The BoneScalpel allows surgeons to improve on existing surgical techniques by creating new approaches to bone cutting and sculpting, leading to substantial time savings and increased operation efficiencies.

The expanded BoneScalpel product platform will allow entry into dynamic market segments like MIS spine surgery. In the future, additional market niche opportunities may exist in small bone surgery of the hand, foot or ankle.
 
SonaStar
 
The SonaStar system provides powerful precise aspiration following the ultrasonic ablation of hard or soft tissue. The SonaStar has been used for a wide variety of surgical procedures applying both open and minimally invasive approaches, including neurosurgery and liver surgery. The SonaStar may also be used with OsteoSculpt ® probe tips, which enable the precise shaping or shaving of bony structures that prevent open access to partially or completely hidden soft tissue masses.
 
SonicOne
 
The SonicOne Ultrasonic Cleansing and Debridement System is a highly innovative, tissue specific approach for the effective removal of devitalized or necrotic tissue and fibrin deposits while sparing viable, surrounding cellular structures. The tissue specific capability is, in part, due to the fact that healthy and viable tissue structures have a higher elasticity and flexibility than necrotic tissue and are more resistant to destruction from the impact effects of ultrasound. The ultrasonic debridement process separates devitalized tissue from viable tissue layers, allowing for a more defined treatment and, usually, a reduced pain sensation. We believe SonicOne establishes a new standard in wound and burn bed preparation, the essential first step in the healing process, while contributing to a faster patient healing.
 
Other Business and Medical Devices
 
In October 1996, we entered into a license agreement with Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies (“MMIT”). The MMIT license covers the further development of our medical technology relating to vessel sealing products, which uses high frequency sound waves to coagulate and divide tissue for both open and laparoscopic surgery. We developed the AutoSonix product with MMIT under the agreement. As a result of this joint development, we co-own certain patents with MMIT and MMIT paid us a 5% royalty on end user sales. The MMIT license gives MMIT exclusive worldwide marketing and sales rights for this technology and device. Total royalties from sales of this device worldwide were approximately $3,764,000, $3,903,000 and $4,162,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The royalty is recorded as “other income” in our financial statements. Our license agreement with MMIT expired in August 2017 and no further payments are due thereafter.
High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Technology
 
We sold our rights to the high intensity focused ultrasound technology to SonaCare Medical, LLC (“SonaCare”) in May 2010. We may receive up to approximately $5.8 million in payment for the sale. SonaCare will pay us 7% of the gross revenues received from its sales of the (i) prostate product in Europe and (ii) kidney and liver products worldwide, until we have received payments of $3 million, and thereafter 5% of the gross revenues, up to an aggregate payment of $5.8 million, all subject to a minimum annual royalty of $250,000. Cumulative payments through June 30, 2017 were $1,504,788.
Other
 
The Company’s distribution agreement with Mentor Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, for the sale, marketing and distribution of the Lysonix soft tissue aspirator used for cosmetic surgery has terminated. Sales continue on a limited non-contractual purchase order basis. Total sales of this device, which includes parts and service, were approximately $48,000, $45,000 and $264,000 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
