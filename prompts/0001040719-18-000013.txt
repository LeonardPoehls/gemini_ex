ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
We are an independent servicer and originator of mortgage loans and servicer of reverse mortgage loans. We service a wide array of loans across the credit spectrum for our own portfolio and for GSEs, government agencies, third-party securitization trusts and other credit owners. Through our consumer, correspondent and wholesale lending channels, we originate and purchase residential mortgage loans that we predominantly sell to GSEs and government agencies. We also operate two complementary businesses: asset receivables management and real estate owned property management and disposition. Our goal is to become a partner with our customers; assisting them with the originations process and through the life of their loan, with a highly regarded originations and servicing platform and quality customer service in an open, honest and straightforward manner.
We are a Maryland corporation incorporated in 1997 and operate throughout the U.S. In April 2009, we were spun off from Walter Energy. Since then, we have grown our servicing and originations businesses both organically and through a number of acquisitions. On February 9, 2018 we changed our name to Ditech Holding Corporation.
The terms “Ditech Holding,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” as used throughout this report refer to Ditech Holding Corporation (successor) and its consolidated subsidiaries after the Effective Date, and/or Walter Investment Management Corp. (predecessor) and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Effective Date.
Emergence from Reorganization Proceedings
On November 30, 2017, Walter Investment Management Corp. filed a Bankruptcy Petition under the Bankruptcy Code to pursue the Prepackaged Plan announced on November 6, 2017. On January 17, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court approved the amended Prepackaged Plan and on January 18, 2018, entered a confirmation order approving the Prepackaged Plan. On February 9, 2018, the Prepackaged Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and Walter Investment Management Corp. emerged from the Chapter 11 Case. The Company continued to operate throughout the Chapter 11 Case and upon emergence changed its name to Ditech Holding Corporation. From and after effectiveness of the Prepackaged Plan, the Company has continued, in its previous organizational form, to carry out its business.
On the Effective Date, all of our previously existing equity interests, including our predecessor common stock, were canceled. Our obligations under our previously outstanding Convertible Notes and Senior Notes, except to the limited extent set forth in the Prepackaged Plan, were also extinguished. Previously outstanding equity and debt interests were exchanged as follows:

• | Senior Notes were exchanged at a rate of 464.11293167 Second Lien Notes and 0.18564517 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Senior Notes;


• | Convertible Notes were exchanged at a rate of 8.76919841 shares of successor common stock, 14.94011581 Series A Warrants and 11.85465711 Series B Warrants per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes; and


• | shares of common stock were exchanged at a rate of 0.05689208 shares of successor common stock, 0.09692659 Series A Warrants and 0.07690920 Series B Warrants per share of predecessor common stock.

Accordingly, we issued:

• | to the holders of predecessor shares of common stock, an aggregate of 2,126,250 shares of successor common stock, 3,622,500 Series A Warrants and 2,874,375 Series B Warrants;


• | to the holders of Senior Notes claims (as defined in the Prepackaged Plan), $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes and $100 million aggregate initial liquidation preference of Convertible Preferred Stock, convertible into common stock at a ratio of 114.9750 per share of preferred stock; and


• | to the holders of Convertible Notes claims (as defined in the Prepackaged Plan), an aggregate of 2,126,250 shares of successor common stock, 3,622,500 Series A Warrants and 2,874,375 Series B Warrants.

In addition, we authorized and reserved for future issuance:

• | 3,193,750 shares of successor common stock for issuance under an equity incentive plan;


• | 7,245,000 shares of successor common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Series A Warrants;


• | 5,748,750 shares of successor common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Series B Warrants; and


• | 11,497,500 shares of successor common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock.

As of February 12, 2018, our newly issued common stock commenced trading on the NYSE under the symbol “DHCP.” 
Pursuant to the terms of the Prepackaged Plan, we entered into the 2018 Credit Agreement, providing for the 2018 Term Loan in the amount of $1.2 billion. For a period of approximately one year following the Effective Date, we will continue to receive financing through a master repurchase agreement for a maximum committed purchase price of $1.0 billion used principally to fund Ditech Financial’s mortgage loan origination business, and a master repurchase agreement providing for a maximum committed purchase price of $800.0 million used principally to fund RMS’s purchase of home equity conversion mortgage loans and foreclosed real estate from certain securitization pools. We also issued variable funding notes under the DAAT Facility and the DPATII Facility for advances made in connection with certain mortgage loan servicing operations. These facilities have aggregate capacities of $475.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively. In addition to the foregoing facility sub-limits, the DAAT Facility, the DPATII Facility, Ditech Financial’s master repurchase agreement and RMS’s master repurchase agreement are subject, collectively, to a combined maximum outstanding amount of $1.9 billion.
For a more detailed discussion of our emergence, refer to the Emergence from Reorganization Proceedings section under Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Analysis.
We believe that we will meet the conditions to qualify under GAAP for fresh start accounting, and accordingly expect to adopt fresh start accounting effective February 10, 2018. The financial statements for the periods prior to such date do not include the effect of any changes in our capital structure or changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities as a result of fresh start accounting. The actual impact at emergence from reorganization and anticipated fresh start accounting will be reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on fresh start accounting.
Beginning in 2016, we have been pursuing various strategies intended to improve our financial and operating performance. These strategies include shifting our servicing business towards subservicing, reducing our investment in mortgage servicing rights, exiting the reverse mortgage originations business, and implementing various measures designed to result in operating improvements. Further detail on our efforts to improve our financial performance and ensure our compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations can be found under the Strategy section of Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Analysis.
Business Segments
We manage our Company in three reportable segments: Servicing; Originations; and Reverse Mortgage. At December 31, 2017, we serviced 1.7 million residential loans with an unpaid principal balance of $207.9 billion. We originated $15.6 billion in unpaid principal balance of mortgage loan volume in 2017. A description of the business conducted by each of these segments is provided below.
Servicing
Our Servicing segment performs servicing for our own mortgage loan portfolio, on behalf of third-party credit owners of mortgage loans for a fee and on behalf of third-party owners of MSR for a fee, which we refer to as subservicing. The Servicing segment also operates complementary businesses including asset receivables management that performs collections of post charge-off deficiency balances for third parties and us. In addition, the Servicing segment holds the assets and mortgage-backed debt of the Residual Trusts.
Our servicing and subservicing activities relating to our mortgage loan portfolio involve the management (e.g., calculation, collection and remittance) of mortgage payments, escrow accounts, insurance claims and customer service. For certain accounts, we perform specialty servicing activities utilizing a “high-touch” model to establish and maintain borrower contact and facilitate loss-mitigation strategies in an attempt to keep defaulted borrowers in their homes. Borrower interactions rely on loss mitigation strategies that apply predictive analytics to identify risk factors and severity grades to determine appropriate loss mitigation options and strategies. We assign a single point of contact to accounts experiencing difficulties in order to make collection calls and coordinate loss mitigation efforts. The single point of contact allows us to build one-on-one relationships with our consumers. We generally follow GSE and agency servicing guidelines (as well as other credit-owner guidelines) to implement a standardized loss mitigation process, which may include loan modification programs for borrowers experiencing temporary hardships. Our loan modification offerings include short-term interest rate reductions and/or payment deferrals and, until recently, also included loan modifications through HAMP, a federally sponsored loan modification program established to assist eligible home owners with loan modifications on their home mortgage debt. When loan modification and other efforts are unable to cure a default, we pursue alternative property resolutions prior to pursuing foreclosure, including short sales (in which the borrower agrees to sell the property for less than the loan balance and the difference is forgiven) and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure (in which the borrower agrees to convey the property deed outside of foreclosure proceedings).
7

With respect to mortgage loans for which we own the MSR, we perform mortgage servicing primarily in accordance with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae servicing guidelines, as applicable. In 2017, we earned approximately 37%, 8% and 12% of our total revenues from servicing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae residential loans, respectively. Under our numerous master servicing agreements and subservicing contracts, we agree to service loans in accordance with servicing standards that the credit owners and/or subservicing clients may change from time to time. These agreements and contracts can typically be terminated by the counterparties thereto, with or without cause. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of certain risks relating to our master servicing agreements and subservicing contracts.
We have acquired servicing rights in bulk transactions, pursuant to co-issue arrangements and in connection with business acquisitions, and by retaining servicing rights relating to mortgage loans we originate. As the owner of servicing rights, we act on behalf of loan owners and have the contractual right to receive a stream of cash flows (expressed as a percentage of unpaid principal balance) in exchange for performing specified servicing functions and temporarily advancing funds to meet contractual payment requirements for loan owners and to pay taxes, insurance and foreclosure costs on delinquent or defaulted mortgages. As a subservicer, we earn a contractual fee on a per-loan basis and we are reimbursed for servicing advances we make on delinquent or defaulted mortgages, generally in the following month. We can earn incentive fees based on the performance of certain loan pools serviced by us and also have the ability, under certain circumstances, to earn modification fees and other program-specific incentives, and ancillary fees, such as late fees. Our specialty servicing fees typically include a base servicing fee and activity-based fees for the successful completion of default-related services.
The value of a servicing right asset is based on the present value of the stream of expected servicing-related cash flows from a loan and is largely dependent on market interest rates, prepayment speeds and delinquency performance. Generally, a rising interest rate environment drives a decline in prepayment speeds and thus increases the value of servicing rights, while a declining interest rate environment drives increases in prepayment speeds and thus reduces the value of servicing rights.
Our Servicing segment procured voluntary insurance for residential loan borrowers, lender-placed hazard insurance for residential loan borrowers and credit owners and other ancillary products through our principal insurance agency until the sale of such agency and substantially all of our insurance agency business on February 1, 2017. This agency earned commissions on insurance sales, and commissions were earned on lender-placed insurance in certain circumstances and if permitted under applicable laws and regulations. Mortgage loans require borrowers to maintain insurance coverage to protect the collateral securing the loan. To the extent a borrower fails to maintain the necessary coverage, we are generally contractually required to add the borrower’s property to our own hazard insurance policy and charge the borrower his/her allocated premium amount. Though we are licensed nationwide to sell insurance products on behalf of third-party insurance carriers, we neither underwrote insurance policies nor adjudicated claims.
Insurance revenues were historically aligned with the size of our servicing portfolio. However, due to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac restrictions that became effective on June 1, 2014, as well as other regulatory and litigation developments with respect to lender-placed insurance, our insurance commissions related to lender-placed insurance policies began to decrease materially beginning in 2014. On February 1, 2017, we completed the sale of our principal insurance agency and substantially all of our insurance agency business. As a result of this sale, we no longer receive any insurance commissions on lender-placed insurance policies. Commencing February 1, 2017, another insurance agency owned by us (and retained by us following the aforementioned sale) began to provide insurance marketing services to third-party insurance agencies and carriers with respect to voluntary insurance policies, including hazard insurance. This insurance agency receives premium-based commissions for its insurance marketing services.
Our Servicing segment performs collections of post charge-off or foreclosure deficiency balances for itself and on behalf of third-party securitization trusts and other asset owners. The third-party fee we earn is based on a percentage of our collections or a percentage of the unpaid principal balance. We recognize revenues associated with our on-balance sheet charged-off loan portfolio through its change in fair value.
Subservicing
As of December 31, 2017, we were the subservicer for approximately 0.7 million accounts with an unpaid principal loan balance of approximately $102.7 billion. These subserviced accounts represented approximately 49% of our total servicing portfolio based on unpaid principal loan balance at that date. Our largest subservicing customer, NRM, represented approximately 69% of our total subservicing portfolio based on unpaid principal loan balance on December 31, 2017. Our next largest subservicing customer represented approximately 21% of our total subservicing portfolio based on unpaid principal loan balance on December 31, 2017.
8

The subservicing contracts pursuant to which we are retained to subservice mortgage loans generally provide that our customer, the owner of the MSR that we subservice on behalf of, can terminate us as subservicer with or without cause, and each such contract has unique terms establishing the fees we will be paid for our work under the contract or upon the termination of the contract, if any, and the standards of performance we are required to meet in servicing the relevant mortgage loans, such that the profitability of our subservicing activity may vary among different contracts. We believe that our subservicing customers consider various factors from time to time in determining whether to retain or change subservicers, including the financial strength and servicer ratings of the subservicer, the subservicer's record of compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations (including any enhanced, "high touch" processes required by the contract) and the success of the subservicer in limiting the delinquency rate of the relevant portfolio. The termination of one or more of our subservicing contracts could have a material adverse effect on us, including on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of certain additional risks and uncertainties relating to our subservicing contracts.
In April 2017, during discussions with a subservicing counterparty regarding our business relationship and our review of our portfolios, this counterparty indicated it was exploring alternatives for certain portfolios we subserviced for such counterparty. At this counterparty's request, we transferred subservicing on mortgage loans with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $7.1 billion to other subservicers or counterparties during 2017.
Originations
Our Originations segment originates and purchases mortgage loans through the following channels:

• | consumer originations, which is comprised of:


◦ | consumer retention - originates mortgage loans primarily through the use of a centralized call center that utilizes leads generated through solicitations of consumers in our existing servicing portfolio and through referrals from our servicing call centers; and


◦ | consumer direct - originates mortgage loans primarily through the use of a centralized call center that utilizes origination leads generated through direct mail, internet, telephone and general advertising campaign solicitations of consumers, some of whom who are not currently in our existing servicing portfolio;


• | correspondent lending - purchases closed mortgage loans from a network of lenders in the marketplace; and


• | wholesale lending - originates mortgage loans through a network of approved brokers.

Beginning in 2016, we combined our consumer retention and consumer direct call centers to pursue a more streamlined consumer lending process. In January 2016, we exited activities associated with our consumer retail channel, which originated mortgage loans through loan officers. Our consumer retail channel originated $14.9 million in mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, we re-entered the wholesale channel in an effort to expand our customer base, after we had initially exited the wholesale channel in the first quarter of 2014.
Our consumer originations operations offer a range of home purchase and refinance mortgage loan options, including fixed and adjustable rate conventional conforming, Ginnie Mae, FHA, VA, USDA and jumbo products. A conventional conforming loan is a mortgage loan that conforms to GSE guidelines, which include, but are not limited to, limits on loan amount, loan-to-value ratios, debt-to-income ratios, and minimum credit scores. Our product offerings include special financing programs such as HARP, which has expanded loan-to-value limits for qualified applicants as compared to conventional conforming loans. The mortgage loans we fund are generally eligible for sale to GSEs or insured by government agencies.
We underwrite the mortgage loans we originate generally to secondary market standards, including the standards set by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the FHA, the USDA, the VA, and jumbo loan investor programs. Loans are reviewed by our underwriters in an attempt to ensure each mortgage loan is documented according to, and its terms comply with, the applicable secondary market standard. Our underwriters determine loan eligibility based on specific loan product requirements, such as loan-to-value, FICO, or maximum loan amount. Third-party diligence tools are utilized by our underwriters to validate data supplied by the potential borrower and to uncover potential discrepancies. We conduct audits on our underwriters to confirm proper adherence to our internal guidelines and polices, which audits are in addition to our standard quality control review. These audits are designed to provide an additional layer of internal review in an attempt to further mitigate quality defects and repurchase risk in the originations process.

Within our correspondent lending channel, we generally purchase the same types of loans that we originate in our consumer originations channel, although the mix varies among these channels. Correspondent lenders with which we do business agree to comply with our client guide, which sets forth the terms and conditions for selling loans to us and generally governs the business relationship. We monitor and attempt to mitigate counterparty risk related to loans that we acquire through our correspondent lending channel by conducting quality control reviews of correspondent lenders, reviewing compliance by correspondent lenders with applicable underwriting standards and our client guide, and evaluating the credit worthiness of correspondent lenders on a periodic basis. In 2017, our correspondent lending channel purchased loans from 488 lenders in the marketplace, of which 39 were associated with approximately half of our purchases.
Within our wholesale lending channel, we originate loans through mortgage brokers. Loans sourced by mortgage brokers are underwritten and funded by us and generally close in our name. Through the wholesale channel, we generally originate the same types of loans that we originate in our consumer originations channel, although the mix varies among these channels. We underwrite and process all loan applications submitted by the mortgage brokers in a manner consistent with that described above for the consumer originations channel. Mortgage brokers with whom we do business agree to comply with our client guide, which sets forth the terms and conditions for brokering loans to us and generally governs the business relationship. We monitor and attempt to mitigate counterparty risk related to loans that we originate through our wholesale lending channel by conducting quality control reviews of mortgage brokers, reviewing compliance by brokers with applicable underwriting standards and our client guide, and evaluating the credit worthiness of brokers on a periodic basis.
Our capital markets group is responsible for pricing loans and managing the interest rate risk through the time a loan is sold to third parties and managing the risk (which we call the “pull-through risk”) that loans we have locked will not be closed and funded in an attempt to maximize loan sale profitability through our various originations channels. The capital markets group uses models and hedging analysis in an attempt to maximize profitability while minimizing the risks inherent in the originations business.
In 2017, the mix of mortgage loans originated by our Originations segment, based on unpaid principal balance, consisted of (i) 50% Fannie Mae conventional conforming loans, (ii) 41% Ginnie Mae loans and (iii) 9% Freddie Mac conventional conforming loans.
Our Originations segment revenue, which is primarily net gains on sales of loans, is impacted by interest rates and the volume of loans locked. The margins earned by our Originations segment are impacted by our cost to originate the loans including underwriting, fulfillment and lead costs. We have historically sold our originated and purchased mortgage loans to third parties while retaining the servicing rights. During 2017, our strategy shifted from retaining servicing rights to subservicing as part of our initiative to generate liquidity and reduce our debt. Going forward, we expect to sell servicing rights to third parties on a more selective basis while continuing to grow our subservicing business with third-party servicing rights owners. 
Reverse Mortgage
Our Reverse Mortgage segment primarily focuses on the servicing of reverse loans. Effective January 2017, we exited the reverse mortgage originations business. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any reverse loans remaining in the originations pipeline and have finalized the shutdown of the reverse mortgage originations business. We will continue to fund undrawn amounts available to borrowers under their loans and, from time to time, securitize these amounts.
As a prior originator of reverse mortgages, this segment received cash proceeds at the time reverse loans were securitized and continues to receive cash proceeds at the time tails are securitized. We securitized substantially all our reverse loans and continue to securitize tails through the Ginnie Mae II MBS program into HMBS. Based upon the structure of the Ginnie Mae II MBS program, we determined that these securitizations do not meet all of the requirements for sale accounting, and as such, we account for these transfers as secured borrowings. Under this accounting treatment, the reverse loans remain on our consolidated balance sheets as residential loans. The segment earns net revenue on the net fair value gains on reverse loans and the related HMBS obligations.
This segment also performs subservicing for third-party credit owners of reverse loans, similar to our Servicing segment, and provides other complementary services for the reverse mortgage market, such as real estate owned property management and disposition, for a fee.
We have been evaluating options for our reverse mortgage business, including the possibility of selling some or all of its assets or pursuing alternative solutions for the business in collaboration with other parties. We cannot be certain whether or on what terms we will be able to consummate any transaction involving our reverse mortgage business or whether any such transaction would reduce our expected reverse mortgage losses. As of December 31, 2017, the net carrying value of our Reverse Mortgage segment securitized loan book was a net liability of approximately $84.2 million.
10

Other
As of December 31, 2017, our Other non-reportable segment holds the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts and corporate debt. 
Competition 
We compete with a great number of institutions in the mortgage banking market for both the servicing and originations businesses as well as in our reverse mortgage servicing and complementary businesses. In the servicing area, we compete with other servicers to acquire MSR and for the right to subservice mortgages for others. Competitive factors in the servicing business include: a servicer’s scale of operations and financial strength; a servicer’s access to capital to fund acquisitions of MSR; a servicer’s ability to meet contractual and regulatory obligations and to achieve favorable performance (e.g., in default management activity) relative to other servicers; a servicer’s ability to provide a favorable experience for the borrower; a servicer's ability to recapture borrowers as they refinance; and a servicer’s cost to service or subservice. 
In the mortgage originations area, we compete to refinance or provide new mortgages to borrowers whose mortgages are in our existing servicing portfolio. In this area, the price and variety of our mortgage products are important factors of competition, as is the reputation of our servicing business and the quality of the experience the borrower may have had with our servicing business. Since mid-2015, our loan origination and servicing businesses have operated under a single “Ditech” brand. We also compete, principally on the basis of price and process efficiency, to acquire mortgages from correspondent lenders. In the future, as we attempt to grow the amount of purchase money (i.e., non-refinance) mortgages we originate, we expect we will also increasingly compete on the basis of brand awareness.
Across our servicing and originations businesses, technology is an important competitive factor. In particular, we believe it will be increasingly important to enable servicing and originations customers to access our services through our website and mobile devices. We face numerous competitors with greater financial resources, human resources and technology resources than ours, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully.
Technology
Our businesses employ technology by using third-party systems where standardization and time to market is key and proprietary systems where functionality and flexibility are critical to regulatory compliance, customer experience and credit performance. The majority of our proprietary systems are supported by a team of information technology professionals who seek to protect our systems and ensure they are effective. In-house developed proprietary systems are leveraged for customer service, default management and reverse mortgage servicing.
On October 27, 2014, we signed a long-term Loan Servicing Agreement with Black Knight Financial Services, LLC for the use of MSP, a mortgage and consumer loan servicing platform. We also use our own proprietary systems for collections, customer service and default management. During the second quarter of 2016, we transitioned approximately 1.4 million loans, or greater than 60% of our mortgage loan servicing portfolio, to MSP, and now have greater than 80% of our mortgage loan servicing portfolio on MSP. Our private label loans, manufactured housing loans and second lien mortgage loans continue to be serviced on our proprietary systems.
Subsidiaries
For a listing of our subsidiaries, refer to Exhibit 21 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees
We have recently undergone several changes in our senior leadership. Effective February 20, 2018, Jeffrey P. Baker commenced service as our Interim Chief Executive Officer and President, succeeding Anthony N. Renzi. Mr. Baker also continues to serve as President of RMS, but no longer serves as our Chief Operations Officer. We have engaged an executive search firm to assist us with the process of identifying internal and external candidates to serve as permanent Chief Executive Officer and President. On February 1, 2018, Gerald A. Lombardo joined the Company and, effective February 9, 2018, succeeded Gary Tillett as Chief Financial Officer.
We employed approximately 3,800 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2017 as compared to approximately 4,900 at December 31, 2016, all of whom were located in the U.S. The decline in full-time equivalent employees was due primarily to distinct actions we took in 2017 in connection with our continued efforts to enhance efficiencies and streamline processes within the organization, which included various organizational changes to scale our leadership team and support functions to further align with our business needs. We believe we have been successful in our efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees. However, we experience significant turnover with respect to certain of our roles, and therefore maintain active and continuous new employee recruiting and training programs. None of our employees is a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
11

We outsource certain support functions that support our loan originations and servicing groups to third-party vendors located in the U.S. and offshore locations in an effort to improve efficiency and reduce cost. These support functions include loan set-up, escrow account set-up, default set-up, foreclosure monitoring, claims filing, post-close audits, indexing and imaging. When we outsource a function, we retain a third-party vendor to perform such function as opposed to having our employees perform such function. We have increased the number of functions we outsource, as well as our use of offshore vendors generally, especially with respect to certain of our technology functions, and we expect to outsource additional back-office and other functions in the future both domestically and abroad.
Transactions with NRM 
NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement
On August 8, 2016, our subsidiary, Ditech Financial, and NRM executed the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement whereby we agreed to sell to NRM all of our right, title and interest in mortgage servicing rights with respect to a pool of mortgage loans, with subservicing retained. The NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement provides that, from time to time, we may sell additional MSR to NRM in bulk or as originated or acquired on a flow basis, subject in each case to the parties agreeing on price and certain other terms.
On January 17, 2018, we agreed to sell to NRM MSR relating to mortgage loans having an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $11.3 billion as of such sale date, with subservicing retained, and we received approximately $90.4 million in cash proceeds from NRM as partial consideration for this MSR sale. We used 80% of such cash proceeds to repay borrowings under the 2013 Credit Agreement and used the remaining cash proceeds for general corporate purposes. Since entering into the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement and through January 17, 2018, in various bulk transactions under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement, we have sold NRM MSR relating to mortgage loans having an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $71.1 billion as of the applicable closing dates of such transactions, in each case with subservicing retained. As of January 17, 2018, we had received $340.4 million in cash proceeds relating to such sales, which proceeds do not include certain holdback amounts relating to such sales that we expect to be paid to us over time. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we received $39.9 million in cash proceeds relating to these holdback amounts and at December 31, 2017 and 2016 had a servicing rights holdback receivable from NRM of $31.3 million and $71.3 million, respectively, which is recorded in receivables, net on the consolidated balance sheets. 
In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company began to sell to NRM, on a flow basis and with subservicing retained, MSR relating to certain mortgage loans that it originates. During 2017 and 2016, the Company sold MSR relating to mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $7.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, to NRM, which included co-issue loans sold with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $6.4 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively. These transfers generated revenues of $61.8 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are recorded in net gains on sales of loans on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
NRM also acquired substantially all of WCO’s MSR portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2016, which consisted of MSR relating to mortgage loans having an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $9.8 billion as of the applicable closing dates, which was serviced by us and included $4.8 billion related to MSR that we previously accounted for as secured borrowings. We subservice these MSR under the NRM Subservicing Agreement.
The initial term of the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement will expire on August 8, 2019 and shall be renewed for successive one-year terms thereafter unless either party provides written notice to the other party of its election not to renew. Each party to the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement also has termination rights upon the occurrence of certain events and NRM can terminate this agreement at any time with a notice of 30 days. In connection with our entry into the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement, we entered into a performance and payment guaranty whereby Ditech Holding guarantees performance of all obligations and all payments required by Ditech Financial under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement.

NRM Subservicing Agreement
On August 8, 2016, we entered into the NRM Subservicing Agreement with NRM whereby we act as subservicer for the mortgage loans whose MSR we sold to NRM under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement and for other mortgage loans as may be agreed upon by us and NRM from time to time, in exchange for a subservicing fee. Under the NRM Subservicing Agreement and a related agreement, we perform all daily servicing obligations on behalf of NRM with respect to the MSR that are serviced by us pursuant to the terms of the NRM Subservicing Agreement, including collecting payments from borrowers and offering refinancing options to borrowers for purposes of minimizing portfolio runoff. On January 17, 2018 Ditech Financial and NRM executed a Side Letter Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, certain provisions of the NRM Subservicing Agreement were amended and/or waived.
With respect to Ditech Financial, for mortgage loans that were being subserviced by Ditech Financial under the NRM Subservicing Agreement prior to January 17, 2018, and for any additional mortgage loans that Ditech Financial may subservice under the NRM Subservicing Agreement that are added to such agreement after such date (other than (i) mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial in a bulk sale agreed to by the parties on January 17, 2018 and (ii) mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial on a flow basis under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement after such date), the initial term of the NRM Subservicing Agreement expired on August 8, 2017 and was automatically renewed for a successive one-year term, and will further be automatically renewed for successive one-year terms thereafter, unless we elect to terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement without cause at the end of any subsequent one-year renewal term by providing notice to NRM at least 120 days prior to the end of the applicable term. With respect to Ditech Financial, for mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial in a bulk MSR sale agreed to by the parties on January 17, 2018 and mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial on a flow basis under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement after such date, the initial term of the NRM Subservicing Agreement shall expire on January 17, 2019 (with respect to the aforementioned bulk MSR sale) or, with respect to each flow MSR assignment agreement executed by the parties after such date in connection with any flow MSR sales by Ditech Financial to NRM after such date, if any, the first anniversary of the first day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter during which such flow MSR assignment agreement was executed, and in each case will automatically renew for successive one-year terms thereafter unless we elect to terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement without cause at the end of any such one-year term by providing notice to NRM at least 120 days prior to the end of the applicable term. If we elect to terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement without cause, we will not be entitled to receive any deconversion fee, will be responsible for certain servicing transfer costs and will owe NRM a transfer fee if such termination occurs within five years from the effective date of the agreement. We may also terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement immediately for cause upon the occurrence of certain events, including, without limitation, any failure by NRM to remit payments (subject to a cure period), certain bankruptcy or insolvency events of NRM, NRM ceasing to be an approved servicer in good standing with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (unless caused by us) and any failure by NRM to perform, in any material respect, its obligations under the agreement (subject to a cure period). Upon any termination of the NRM Subservicing Agreement by us for cause, NRM will owe us a deconversion fee and be responsible for certain servicing transfer costs.

With respect to NRM, for mortgage loans that were being subserviced by Ditech Financial under the NRM Subservicing Agreement prior to January 17, 2018, and for any additional mortgage loans that Ditech Financial may subservice under the NRM Subservicing Agreement that are added to such agreement after such date (other than (i) mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial in a bulk sale agreed to by the parties on January 17, 2018 and (ii) mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial on a flow basis under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement after such date), the initial term of the NRM Subservicing Agreement expired on August 8, 2017 and thereafter the agreement automatically terminates with respect to such mortgage loans, unless renewed by NRM on a monthly basis. Since the expiration of the initial term, NRM has renewed the NRM Subservicing Agreement each month thereafter. In the case of mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial in a bulk MSR sale agreed to by the parties on January 17, 2018 and mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial on a flow basis under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement after such date, the initial term of the NRM Subservicing Agreement shall expire on January 17, 2019 (with respect to the aforementioned bulk MSR sale) or, with respect to each flow MSR assignment agreement executed by the parties after such date in connection with any flow MSR sales by Ditech Financial to NRM after such date, if any, the first anniversary of the first day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter during which such flow MSR assignment agreement was executed, and following the applicable initial term the agreement automatically terminates with respect to the applicable mortgage loans unless renewed by NRM on a quarterly basis. If NRM fails to renew the agreement, it will owe us a deconversion fee. In addition, if NRM elects to terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement without cause, it will owe us a deconversion fee and be responsible for certain servicing transfer costs. NRM may also terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement immediately for cause upon the occurrence of certain events, including, without limitation, our failure to remit payments (subject to a cure period), our failure to provide reports to NRM (subject to a cure period), a change of control of Ditech Financial or Ditech Holding, our failure to satisfy certain portfolio performance measures relating to delinquency rates or advances, our ceasing to be an approved servicer in good standing with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, any failure by Ditech Financial or Ditech Holding to satisfy certain financial metrics, certain bankruptcy or insolvency events of Ditech Financial or Ditech Holding and any failure by us to perform, in any material respect, our obligations under the agreement (subject to a cure period). Because certain of these events have already occurred, NRM has the ability to terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement immediately for cause with respect to mortgage loans that were being subserviced by Ditech Financial under the NRM Subservicing Agreement prior to January 17, 2018, and for any additional mortgage loans that Ditech Financial may subservice under the NRM Subservicing Agreement that are added to such agreement after such date (other than (i) mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial in a bulk sale agreed to by the parties on January 17, 2018 and (ii) mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial on a flow basis under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement after such date), but has not terminated such agreement with respect to any such mortgage loans. Pursuant to the January 17, 2018 Side Letter Agreement Ditech Financial entered into with NRM, NRM agreed to, among other things, waive its right to terminate the Subservicing Agreement for cause due to the occurrence of certain of these events with respect to mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial in a bulk sale agreed to by the parties on January 17, 2018 and mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial on a flow basis under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement after such date. Upon any termination of the NRM Subservicing Agreement by NRM for cause, we will not be entitled to receive any deconversion fee, will be responsible for certain servicing transfer costs and will owe NRM a transfer fee if such termination occurs within five years from the effective date of the agreement.
Walter Capital Opportunity LLC
In 2014, we established WCO, a company formed to invest in mortgage-related assets, including MSR and excess servicing spread related to MSR. We own approximately 10% of WCO; third-party investors own the remainder of WCO. Beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2016, WCO, in various transactions, acquired MSR, excess servicing spread and other mortgage-related assets in transactions with us and other market participants. From 2014 through 2016, we served as investment manager for WCO pursuant to a management agreement.
In November 2016, WCO entered into a series of agreements whereby it agreed to sell substantially all of its assets, which included the sale of substantially all of its MSR portfolio, to NRM. In connection with the December 2016 closing of the transactions relating thereto, WCO commenced liquidation activities and is currently projecting it will wind down its operations in the fourth quarter of 2018. During the third quarter of 2017, we and WCO terminated the management agreement and entered into a services agreement, under which we currently provide non-investment advisory and administrative services to WCO. We received $11.5 million in distributions from our equity investment in WCO during 2017, which are included in other investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Rights Agreement
We had previously adopted the Rights Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2015, and subsequently amended and restated on November 11, 2016 and further amended on November 9, 2017 and February 9, 2018, which provided that if any person or group of persons, excluding certain exempted persons, acquired 4.99% or more of the outstanding common stock of Walter Investment Management Corp. or any other interest that would be treated as “stock” for the purposes of Section 382, there would be a triggering event potentially resulting in significant dilution in the voting power and economic ownership of such acquiring person or group. The Rights Agreement was intended to help protect our “built-in tax losses” and certain other tax benefits by acting as a deterrent to any person or group of persons acting in concert from becoming or obtaining the right to become the beneficial owner (including through constructive ownership of securities owned by others) of 4.99% or more of the shares of our common stock. The Rights Agreement was scheduled to expire on November 11, 2018 or upon the earlier occurrence of certain events, subject to extension by the Board of Directors or exchange of rights by us.
On the Effective Date, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Rights Agreement with Computershare that accelerated the scheduled expiration date of the Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement) to the Effective Date. The Rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, which were also canceled by operation of the Prepackaged Plan, have expired and are no longer outstanding, and the Rights Agreement has terminated.
In connection with the adoption of our Rights Agreement, we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, setting forth the rights, powers, and preferences of our junior participating preferred stock issuable upon exercise of the rights. The cancellation of all existing equity interests by operation of the Prepackaged Plan included the cancellation of any rights issued under the Rights Agreement. In addition, on the Effective Date, we filed Articles of Amendment with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, which among other things, served to eliminate our junior participating preferred stock. Our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, adopted on the Effective Date, include transfer restriction provisions intended to protect the tax benefits described above. Our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, adopted on the Effective Date, include certain restrictions on the transfer of our securities intended to preserve the value of our tax attributes, by minimizing the likelihood of an “ownership change” under applicable tax rules. Subject to certain exceptions, the Articles of Amendment and Restatement generally will restrict (i) any transfer that would result in a person or entity accumulating 4.75% or more of our common shares (assuming for the purpose of calculating the 4.75% that all outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock have fully converted) or 4.75% or more of the outstanding shares of our Convertible Preferred Stock (on a separate class basis), (ii) any transfer as to any person or entity that already owns shares at or above such 4.75% threshold, such person or entity acquiring additional stock of our securities and (iii) under limited circumstances described in the Articles of Amendment and Restatement, a transfer by a person or entity that owns shares at or above such 4.75% threshold from disposing of all or part of such stock.
The Articles of Amendment and Restatement exempt from the restrictions (i) any transfer approved in writing (prior to the date of the transfer) by the Board of Directors, (ii) a tender or exchange offer by us to purchase our securities, a purchase program effected by us on the open market or certain other redemptions of our securities, (iii) a conversion, pursuant to its terms, of Convertible Preferred Stock, and (iv) certain transfers by a person or entity that received as part of our Restructuring and owns 4.75% or more of our Convertible Preferred Stock. 
The procedure for approval of a transfer by the Board of Directors, as well as the other details and elements of these restrictions, are set forth in the Articles of Amendment and Restatement.
Laws and Regulations 
Our business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities, including the CFPB, HUD, VA, the SEC and various state agencies that license, audit and conduct examinations of our mortgage servicing and mortgage originations businesses. We are also subject to a variety of regulatory and contractual obligations imposed by credit owners, investors, insurers and guarantors of the mortgages we originate and service, including, but not limited to, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHFA, USDA and the VA/FHA. Furthermore, our industry has been under scrutiny by federal and state regulators over the past several years, and we expect this scrutiny to continue. Laws, rules, regulations and practices that have been in place for many years may be changed, and new laws, rules, regulations and administrative guidance have been, and may continue to be, introduced in order to address real and perceived problems in our industry. We expect to incur ongoing operational, legal and system costs in order to comply with these rules and regulations.
Federal Law
We are required to comply with numerous federal consumer protection and other laws, including, but not limited to:

• | the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Regulation P, which requires initial and periodic communication with consumers on privacy matters and the maintenance of privacy regarding certain consumer data in our possession;

15


• | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which regulates the timing and content of communications on debt collections;


• | the TILA, including HOEPA, and Regulation Z, which regulate mortgage loan origination activities, require certain disclosures be made to mortgagors regarding terms of mortgage financing, regulate certain high-cost mortgages, mandate home ownership counseling for mortgage applicants and regulate certain mortgage servicing activities;

• | Regulation AB under the Securities Act, which requires registration, reporting and disclosure for mortgage-backed securities;


• | certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the Consumer Financial Protection Act, which among other things, created the CFPB and prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices;


• | the Federal Trade Commission Act, the FTC Credit Practices Rules and the FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule, which prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices and certain related practices;

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, constituted a sweeping reform of the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, as well as the regulation of derivatives, capital market activities and consumer financial services. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a new federal entity responsible for regulating consumer financial services. The CFPB has rulemaking authority with respect to many of the federal consumer protection laws applicable to mortgage servicers and originators, including TILA, RESPA and the FDCPA. The CFPB also has supervision, examination and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services offered by certain non-depository institutions and large insured depository institutions. The CFPB's jurisdiction includes persons (such as us) originating, brokering or servicing residential mortgage loans, those persons performing loan modification or foreclosure relief services in connection with such loans and certain entities involved in the transfer of MSR.
16

Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act imposed a number of requirements on mortgage originators and servicers of residential mortgage loans, significantly increased the penalties for noncompliance with certain consumer protection laws and also established new standards and practices for mortgage originators and servicers. Subsequent to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has issued, and is expected to continue to issue, various rules that impact mortgage servicing and originations, including: periodic billing statements; certain notices and acknowledgments; prompt crediting of borrowers’ accounts for payments received; additional notice, review and timing requirements with respect to delinquent borrowers; prompt investigation of complaints by borrowers; additional requirements before purchasing insurance to protect the lender’s interest in the property; certain customer service benchmarks for servicers; servicers’ obligations to establish reasonable policies and procedures; requirements to provide information about mortgage loss mitigation options to delinquent borrowers; rules governing the scope, timing, content and format of disclosures to consumers regarding the interest rate adjustments of their variable-rate transactions; establishing certain requirements relating to billing statements, payment crediting and the provision of payoff statements; preventing or limiting servicers of residential mortgage loans from taking certain actions (e.g. the charging of certain fees); requirements for determining prospective borrowers’ abilities to repay their mortgages; removing incentives for higher cost mortgages; prohibiting prepayment penalties for non-qualified mortgages; prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses; requiring additional disclosures to potential borrowers; restricting the fees that mortgage originators may collect; requiring new mortgage loan disclosures that integrate the TILA disclosures with the RESPA disclosures for certain covered transactions; and other new requirements, in each case either increasing costs and risks related to servicing and originations or reducing revenues currently generated.
Recently, the only reverse mortgage loan product we have originated is the HECM, an FHA-insured loan that must comply with FHA and other regulatory requirements. Accordingly, many of the recent federal legal changes affecting our reverse mortgage business relate to the HECM. On September 3, 2013, the FHA announced changes to the HECM program, pursuant to authority under the Reverse Mortgage Stabilization Act, signed into law on August 9, 2013. The changes impact initial mortgage insurance premiums and principal limit factors, impose restrictions on the amount of funds that senior borrowers may draw down at closing and during the first 12 months after closing, and require a financial assessment for all HECM borrowers to ensure they have the capacity and willingness to meet their financial obligations and the terms of the reverse mortgage. Key components of the financial assessment include a credit history and property charge payment history analysis, a cash flow/residual income analysis, and an analysis of compensating factors and extenuating circumstances to determine if the applicant is eligible for a HECM loan. In addition, the changes require borrowers to set aside a portion of the loan proceeds they receive at closing (or withhold a portion of monthly loan disbursements) for the payment of property taxes and homeowners insurance based on the results of the financial assessment. The new HECM requirements generally became effective on September 30, 2013, with the new financial assessment requirements and funding requirements for the payment of property charges taking effect on April 27, 2015.
State Law
We are also subject to extensive state licensing, statutory and regulatory requirements as a mortgage servicer, loan originator and debt collector throughout the U.S. We are subject to ongoing supervision, audits and examinations conducted by state regulators, including periodic requests from state and other agencies for records, documents and information regarding our policies, procedures and business practices.
State laws affecting our businesses have also been evolving. Some changes have occurred on a nationwide basis at the state level due to the establishment and/or amendment of minimum standards under federal law, such as state licensing requirements. Some states may seek to incorporate federal requirements as a requirement imposed on a state licensed entity, while other states may seek to impose their own additional requirements to the extent not preempted under federal law. Additionally, there have been growing trends in state lawmaking focusing on the servicing of mortgage loans related to, for example, data privacy, loan modifications and anti-foreclosure measures.
Recent Regulatory Developments
Servicing Segment
On June 27, 2017, the CFPB announced a final rule addressing technical corrections to existing mortgage servicing rules under Regulation X of RESPA and Regulation Z of TILA, supplementing a final rule issued on August 4, 2016 that clarified, revised and amended provisions regarding, among other things, force-placed insurance, early intervention and loss mitigation requirements under Regulation X and prompt crediting and periodic statement requirements under Regulation Z. The August 4, 2016 final rule also addressed proper compliance regarding certain servicing requirements when a person is a potential or confirmed successor in interest, is a debtor in bankruptcy, or sends a cease communication request under the FDCPA and made technical corrections to several provisions of Regulation X and Regulation Z. The majority of the requirements under the most recent and the August 4, 2016, final rules became effective October 19, 2017.
17

On October 4, 2017, the CFPB announced a proposed rule that would amend the 2016 Regulation Z mortgage servicing rule’s requirements relating to the timing for servicers to transition to providing modified or unmodified periodic statements and coupon books in connection with a consumer’s bankruptcy case.
The CFPB also issued an interpretive rule under the FDCPA relating to servicers' compliance with certain mortgage servicing rules. Most of the provisions of the final rule took effect on October 19, 2017, with the provisions relating to successors in interest and the provisions relating to periodic statements for borrowers in bankruptcy expected to take effect April 19, 2018.
There have been various legal and regulatory developments in Nevada regarding liens asserted by HOAs for unpaid assessments. In September 2014, the Nevada Supreme Court held that an HOA non-judicial foreclosure sale can extinguish a mortgage lender’s previously-recorded first deed of trust on a property if that foreclosure is to recover assessments categorized as super-priority amounts. In June 2015, the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada issued an opinion holding that federal law prohibits an HOA foreclosure proceeding from extinguishing a first deed of trust assigned to Fannie Mae. A Nevada state court subsequently reached the same conclusion. The Nevada Supreme Court also reversed a lower court summary judgment decision invalidating an HOA foreclosure sale on the basis that the HOA refused the lienholder’s tender of the super-priority portion of the lien and that the HOA sale was commercially unreasonable. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled that these were issues of fact and remanded for further proceedings. Additional litigation in both state and federal courts and appellate courts is pending with respect to these issues. Case law is quickly developing, is not harmonious as between federal and state courts and varies by judge within each jurisdiction. Also, legislation in Nevada, which became effective on October 1, 2015, requires HOAs to provide notice to lienholders relating to the default and foreclosure sale and also to provide creditors with a right to redeem the property for up to 60 days following an HOA foreclosure sale. In January 2017, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that the state’s non-judicial HOA foreclosure statutes in effect prior to the 2015 amendments do not unconstitutionally violate due process and are not a government taking. This opinion conflicts with a 2016 decision of the Ninth Circuit, holding that the statute was unconstitutional. Credit owners may assert claims against servicers for failure to advance sufficient funds to cover unpaid HOA assessments and protect the credit owner’s interest in the subject property. We service numerous loans in Nevada and are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings affected by, or related to, these HOA matters.
Originations Segment
On June 27, 2017, the CFPB announced a final rule amending the TILA-RESPA “Know Before You Owe” mortgage disclosure rule. The final rule formalizes guidance about the rule, provides greater clarity and certainty and helps facilitate compliance within the mortgage industry. In addition to various clarifications, minor changes, and technical corrections, the rule makes four substantive changes to the existing rule. The final rule: (i) creates tolerances for the total of payments disclosure; (ii) provides for an adjustment of the current partial exemption for certain housing assistance loans to clarify that recording fees and transfer taxes are excluded from the exemption's limitation on costs; (iii) includes all cooperatives under the rule regardless of whether the cooperative is classified as real property under state law; and (iv) incorporates and expands upon previous CFPB webinar guidance concerning the sharing of disclosures with sellers and various other parties.
On July 7, 2017, the CFPB announced a proposed rule to further amend the "Know Before You Owe" mortgage disclosure rule. The proposed amendments relate to when a creditor may compare charges paid by or imposed on the consumer to amounts disclosed on a closing disclosure, instead of a loan estimate, to determine if an estimated closing cost was disclosed in good faith. Specifically, the proposed amendments would permit creditors to do so regardless of when the closing disclosure is provided relative to consummation.
On August 24, 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule to make technical corrections and clarifications to certain requirements adopted by the CFPB’s HMDA (Regulation C) final rule issued on October 28, 2015. The final rule also amends Regulation C to increase the threshold for collecting and reporting data about open-end lines of credit for a period of two years so that financial institutions originating fewer than 500 open-end lines of credit in either of the preceding two years would not be required to begin collecting such data until Jan. 1, 2020, and also adopted a new reporting exclusion. The data collection requirements implemented by the 2015 and 2017 final rules became effective on January 1, 2018, while the reporting requirements are expected to begin in 2019.
Reverse Mortgage Segment
On January 19, 2017, HUD published the “Final HECM Rule, FHA: Strengthening the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program.” The primary purpose of this rule was to codify into regulation prior guidance issued by HUD under mortgagee letters authorized by the Reverse Mortgage Stabilization Act of 2013 and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. This rule addresses a wide range of reverse mortgage origination and servicing issues, and in certain areas, amends prior guidance and rules. This rule became effective on September 19, 2017.
18

HUD Mortgagee Letter 2017-05, effective April 18, 2017, provided consolidated and updated guidance regarding the submission of HECM assignments to HUD. Since the publication of HUD Mortgagee Letter 2017-05, RMS has increasingly experienced delays and rejections with respect to HUD’s acceptance and payment of certain assignment claims, which, in turn, increases the amount of time RMS must carry the applicable loan's balance between the time the loan is bought out of a GNMA pool until the assignment claim is paid. The two predominant reasons for the increase in delays and rejections of HECM assignments relate to HUD Mortgagee Letter 2017-05 being interpreted to require proof that property taxes are "current," as opposed to the prior requirement of proof that such taxes were paid "timely," and the HUD Mortgagee Letter 2017-05 guidance that the only acceptable proof of hazard insurance is a copy of the borrower's current insurance "declarations page." Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of certain risks relating to our HECM repurchase obligations and related matters.
Federal Regulatory Freeze and Uncertainty
Following the November 2016 Presidential and Congressional elections, a level of heightened uncertainty exists with respect to the future of regulation of mortgage lending and servicing, including the future of the Dodd Frank Act and the CFPB. For example, in January 2017, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum and an Executive Order designed to decrease the number of federal regulations. The memorandum directed executive departments and agencies to freeze new or pending regulations, and the order directed agencies to eliminate at least two existing regulations for every proposed regulation. The Office of Management and Budget subsequently clarified that the Executive Order does not apply to independent agencies such as the CFPB, and the applicability of the Presidential Memorandum to such independent agencies is less clear. However, on February 12, 2018, the CFPB released its Strategic Plan, in which it communicated its intention to identify and address unduly burdensome regulations. These events create uncertainty with regard to final regulations already published in the Federal Register but not yet in effect, such as the CFPB’s amendments to the mortgage servicing rules requiring servicers to provide modified periodic statements to certain consumers in bankruptcy and transition to and from providing such statements as they enter and come out of bankruptcy, and are expected to take effect in April 2018. Further, the release of the Strategic Plan came on the heels of the CFPB’s announcement on December 21, 2017 that (a) it did not intend to assess penalties with respect to errors for data collected in 2018 and reported in 2019 under HMDA but (b) it did intend to reconsider various aspects of its 2015 HMDA rule. We cannot predict when these rules will take effect, if at all, nor can we predict the specific legislative or executive actions that may follow or what actions federal and state regulators may take in response to potential changes to the Dodd Frank Act or to the regulatory environment generally.
