ITEM 1. Business
Overview 
CafePress Inc. (the "Company," "we," "us," "our") is a retailer of gifts and expressories. We take pride in having the perfect item for every passion. We were founded in 1999 as a California corporation, we reincorporated in Delaware in 2005 and we completed our initial public offering in April 2012. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "PRSS." 
We are a leading retailer of personalized products offering a wide variety of expressive gifts and accessories including t-shirts and apparel, mugs and drinkware, and home goods such as custom shower curtains and bed coverings. We conduct most of our business on our primary United States-based domain, CafePress.com and also operate CafePress branded websites for the markets in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. We also sell CafePress branded products through other online retail

partners such as Amazon and Walmart. Our products are customized with expressive designs contributed through a variety of means, including crowd-sourced user generated content, stock art licenses and licensed content relationships with large entertainment companies and brands. Our distinctive items bring our customers' passions to life and connect people to each other.
Our production facility and fulfillment center in Louisville, Kentucky has innovative technology and manufacturing processes that enable us to provide high-quality customized products that are individually built to order. Our proprietary processes enable us to produce a broad range of merchandise efficiently and profitably. We also maintain a diverse network of contract manufacturers that give us the ability to broaden our manufacturing capabilities and produce in certain international locales.
E-Commerce Platform Products and Services 
CafePress receives content from a wide variety of sources including user-generated content, licensed content from various properties, and content from stock photo sources. These products are digitally rendered for consumers onto a variety of base goods, and the combination of the content and base good creates the range of products offered on CafePress.com.
For CafePress.com, these products and the associated metadata will be marketed to draw both search engine and direct traffic. Prices are typically set by CafePress when we control the marketing. This is what is typically called our Marketplace.
User-generated content can also be created on CafePress for self-purchase, or to be sold. If user-generated content is to be sold to others, the content generator is called a Shopkeeper, and may be paid a commission in one of two ways. The predominant method is a marketplace commission which is fairly standard for most Shopkeepers, and has the terms of the commission structure online.  The Shopkeeper can also elect to create a "Shop". The Shopkeeper can use a suite of tools to provide a unique e-commerce experience, set their own markup above our standard product pricing, and drive their own marketing. As shopkeepers drive their own traffic and sets their own markup for their Shop, the commission is typically higher than through the Marketplace.
Our Retail Partner Channels or Feeds (collectively referred to as "Retail Partner Channels") typically refers to the fact that we are generating revenue from sources other than the CafePress.com or our related websites.  Retail Partners refers to the distribution of our more popular content and products to other e-commerce retail websites such as Amazon and Walmart. 
Whether sold on CafePress.com or through Retail Partner Channels, the resulting order is electronically communicated to our fulfillment center in Louisville, Kentucky, and then routed to the appropriate location to be manufactured on-demand. Most of our goods are manufactured in Louisville, Kentucky, however we do have fulfillment arrangements with others with different product expertise, or geographical advantages such as Europe, Australia and Canada. Products are then produced, and shipped from the appropriate fulfillment location. 
We generate the majority of revenue from CafePress.com and by controlling the production process in our manufacturing facility, we can produce high-quality products, innovate quickly, maintain a favorable cost structure and ensure timely shipments to customers during our peak periods of demand. We generate approximately 89% of our revenue from sales originating in the United States and our sales are seasonally driven as we generate more than 40% of our total revenue during our fiscal fourth quarter.
Business and Marketing Strategy
Our goal is to help individuals establish connections and celebrate their identities, interests and affinities through unique products and content. The desire to personalize products and express affinity through the things individuals surround themselves with, whether they are decorating their apparel, their home or office, remains strong, and as we improve the quality of our execution and services, we believe we can eventually capture more of that demand. To reach new and existing customers, we rely on consumer awareness of our brand and use a variety of integrated marketing programs, including search engine marketing, search engine optimization, social media, e-mail and other forms of online marketing.
Key elements of our strategy, both in 2016 and going forward, to achieve this goal include:

• | Maintain Financial Discipline. We manage our business activities with a focus on continued revenue and profitability growth. Our financial strategy involves growing revenue across our Cafepress.com site and Retail 

2

Index to Financial Statements

Partner Channels to take advantage of the multi-billion-dollar online TV and Catalog markets, but in a way that generates continued Adjusted EBITDA growth. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) less interest and other income (expense), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition related costs, stock-based compensation, impairment charges and restructuring costs.

• | Enhance Brand Awareness. In 2016, we renewed our efforts to build upon our existing product and brand awareness through marketing and communication programs. Our marketing and branding efforts are key elements of our growth strategy. Going forward, our strategy is to aggressively increase our general marketing efforts, along with expanding our Internet presence through search engine marketing and search engine optimization, and our branded expansion through Retail Partner Channels. 


• | Rebuild the User Experience. A key aspect of our ability to improve our retention and customer counts is to provide a site that removes as much friction from the purchasing funnel as possible. During 2016, we launched a refreshed website with a new global navigation so our customers can shop by interest and occasion. In addition, lifestyle photography and consistency across web pages was added to enhance the shopping experience and provide a uniform shopping experience for customers visiting our website via PC, MAC and mobile devices. We plan to continue to invest in technology enhancements that improve conversion and the customer experience. 


• | Revenue Growth. With enhancements to several key back-end marketing tools completed in 2016, we expect to increase our marketing activities to acquire more customers and orders. We intend to support growth in our Retail Partner Channels by focusing on product discoverability and an enhanced customer experience that includes branding, detailed product descriptions, photographs and reviews and refined pricing and promotions. During 2016, web traffic and order volume increased 1% and 7%, respectively. 


• | Create long-term relationships with our customers. We are focused on acquiring new customers and retaining existing customers to maximize the lifetime value of our customer relationships. We believe we will achieve this by establishing stronger relationships with our customers, understanding their passions and interests, and connecting with them through the media channels that are most appropriate. 


• | Focus on high quality content partners. In 2016, we expanded our roster of licensed content partners as well as increased the range of content accessible on our site to attract new users. We continue to focus on film, television, sports, video game and other entertainment properties to bring content to our platform. For example, in 2016, we signed or implemented new licensed entertainment properties to make official and fan merchandise available through our platform, including My Little Pony, Transformers, Orange is the New Black and I Love Lucy. In addition, we also reached an agreement to bring content from over 100 fraternity and sororities to our users. 


• | Attract, Retain and Grow Our Leadership Team. In order to successfully execute our strategies, we require a talented leadership team. As a result, we intend to continue our focus to attract, retain and grow our team and to build continuity in our daily operations. By providing our employees with a great place to work, we believe that we continue to strengthen our high performance culture. 

Technology and Production Systems 
We use a combination of proprietary and third-party technology, including the following:

• | Customer Relationship Management or CRM System. Our integrated CRM system is composed of various tools designed to convert first-time customers into repeat buyers. We seek to increase average order size by expanding customer awareness, providing targeted, segmented offers to customers and encouraging cross- and up-selling. Our system uses a variety of data, including website usage patterns, order size, order frequency, products purchased and seasonality factors, as well as customer satisfaction information. This data is continually updated and refreshed in a data warehouse, from which different customer segments are identified and monitored for targeted marketing communications. 


• | Website System. We have designed our website systems to be secure and highly available within a data center, and not across geographically isolated data centers. We can scale to increasing numbers of customers cost-effectively by adding relatively inexpensive industry-standard computers and servers. We have a strong commitment to our privacy policy, and we utilize technologies such as firewalls and encryption technology for secure transmission of personal information between customers' computers and our website system and intrusion detection systems. 


• | Image Archive We store our customers' images in our image archive. Once a customer uploads a photo to our website, it is copied to six redundant systems. We continue to expand our storage capacity to meet increasing customer demand. Our innovative storage architecture provides cost effective storage costs, facilitates the safe 

3

and secure archiving of customers' images and delivers the speed and performance required to create products in real-time. 

• | Rendering. Our in-house system examines the content of an image and returns metadata that we utilize to run a product creation engine. This system produces the best quality image for the product selected. Image review also occurs during the production process by our print quality team to ensure that the design chosen by our customers is of the highest quality. 


• | Production System. We operate our production facility in Louisville, Kentucky. Our single piece flow automated production system efficiently controls our production processes, including order management and pick, pack and shipping operations. Using proprietary algorithms, the production system analyzes thousands of orders daily and automates the workflow into our state-of-the-art digital printers. We also use third-party print on demand partners internationally to assist with the speed of delivery and to help control fulfillment costs. 

Competition
The market for customized products and services is large, fragmented and intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future. We face competition from a wide range of companies, including the following:

• | Small, traditional offline printing, gifting and souvenir businesses for apparel, accessories, home, or other customized products;


• | E-commerce companies, including large online retailers and marketplaces such as Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Target and eBay (who may also serve as our retail partners);


• | Online providers of customized products such as RedBubble Inc., CustomInk LLC, Spreadshirt Inc., Threadless.com, TeeSpring or Zazzle Inc. as well as providers of distinctive goods like Etsy, Inc. or Uncommon LLC;


• | Online providers allowing users to customize goods in specific vertical markets, such as Cimpress N.V. for small businesses and Shutterfly, Inc. or SmugMug, Inc. for photographic products;


• | Physical and catalog retailers of personalized merchandise such as Red Envelope and Things Remembered; and


• | Small, but numerous, online providers who address niche customization services and product offerings, enabled by advances in digital printing technologies.

We also indirectly compete with Internet portals and shopping search engines that are involved in e-commerce or sell products or services either directly or in collaboration with other retailers, and our reliance on Internet portals and other sources of Internet and referral traffic, such as Facebook, impacts both the way we do business and our performance against competitors. Changes to their practices could drive traffic to our competitors and away from our e-commerce sites in ways we may not anticipate or that will cause us to expend further resources to successfully compete. The shift to mobile site access prevalence presents challenges as we cope with adapting our site to shifting traffic patterns and the different use characteristics which include lower average order size, amongst others. Furthermore, to the extent that other companies are able to replicate our processes or if advances in print-on-demand technologies reduce any technological or other early mover leads we may have, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.
Some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than us, including significant brand recognition, sales volume and customer bases. In addition, other online retailers may be acquired by, receive investment from or enter into strategic relationships with, well-established and well-financed companies or investors that would help enhance their competitive positions. Some of our competitors may be able to secure goods and raw materials from suppliers on more favorable terms, devote greater resources to marketing activities and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and system development than us. Increased competition may reduce our operating margins, market share and brand recognition, or force us to incur losses. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include:

• | Favorable brand recognition and trust;


• | Technological expertise;


• | Quality, breadth and type of the products sold and services offered;

4

Index to Financial Statements


• | Competitive pricing;


• | Ability to source products efficiently and cost effectively;


• | Ease of use and convenience of our services;


• | Ability to anticipate and quickly adapt to changing customer demands and customer service needs; and


• | Effective marketing and distribution.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.
Divestitures
In November 2014, we sold the primary assets and liabilities of our online custom stationery products business, InvitationBox.com. In March 2015, we sold the primary assets and liabilities of our Art business, which included our custom canvas production and printing facility in Raleigh, North Carolina, and the front-end direct e-commerce websites for CanvasOnDemand.com, GreatBigCanvas.com, and ImageKind.com. In March 2015, we also sold the primary assets and liabilities of our Groups business, which included our printing facility used by our Logosportswear.com brand operated in Cheshire, Connecticut. Finally, in September, 2015, we sold our EZ Prints business, which included the B2B printing facility in Norcross, Georgia, and provided a suite of enterprise class deployable software products and services focused on private label e-commerce customization services, including the retail website Ezprints.com. We believe our recent divestitures are an integral part of our strategy to focus on the core CafePress.com business and to strengthen our balance sheet. By concentrating on fewer production facilities, products and website brands, we believe we can improve our quality and operate more efficiently. Financial information about these divestitures is set forth in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 - Discontinued Operations, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained within this report.
Intellectual Property
We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights, as well as employee and third-party confidentiality and invention agreements to safeguard our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2016, we had seven issued patents and one patent application pending in the United States generally covering our e-commerce services or proprietary printing and decorating services and our online platform for designing and generating framed products. We continually assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs and methodologies and processes that we believe may ultimately provide significant competitive advantages.
As of December 31, 2016, we held 19 U.S. trademark registrations (some of which are registered in multiple classes), which include, among others, CAFEPRESS.COM, CAFEPRESS, and the “cafepress” logo. We are in the process of registering additional trademarks supporting our business and we also claim common law trademark rights in numerous trademarks. We have registered our CAFEPRESS.COM and CAFEPRESS trademarks in numerous countries in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. 
Our patents expire at various times between November 2025 and June 2031. In addition, in accordance with U.S. federal trademark law, our registered trademarks are registered for an initial period of 10 years, subject to subsequent 10-year renewal periods. We currently intend to maintain the registration of our trademarks indefinitely. We also register trademarks in dozens of international jurisdictions and likewise plan to renew our trademark registrations indefinitely wherever we conduct business. In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into hundreds of license agreements with content partners for the license of published entertainment content and consumer brands. We are not dependent on any specific content license agreement in the conduct of our business. We also license various forms of third-party technologies in the provision of our e-commerce services. We believe we have multiple sources for third-party technologies used in our business, and if we were to change licensor's for any reasons, it would result in minimal disruption to our operations, if any. 
Our standard content license agreement is typically for a term of three years, subject to termination in the event of an uncured material breach of either party and renewable for one year terms thereafter. Our third-party technology licenses are typically for a term of one to two years, with optional renewal clauses upon mutual agreement of the parties. 
We also rely upon certain unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, licensed third-party technologies, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. For certain of our proprietary know-how and processes, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality and invention agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our system, including technical processes, equipment and system designs, algorithms and procedures, which relate to our software controls, manufacturing process and methods of system design 
5

Index to Financial Statements

involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications. We have taken security measures to protect these elements. For example, all of our research and development personnel are required to enter into proprietary information and inventions agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us. We also require our customers and business partners to enter into non-disclosure agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology, proprietary processes, sales data or business plans.
Government Regulation
The legal environment of the Internet is evolving rapidly in the United States and around the world. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the Internet in general, and how they will relate to our business in particular, are often unclear in many cases. For example, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the e-commerce and online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, defamation, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement. 
The nature of our user-generated content business models presents legal challenges to our business and operations. Our content usage policy and policies surrounding infringement of intellectual property rights or the rights of third parties, such as rights of privacy and publicity, play a key role in our business operations and the systems and practices that support them are particularly important to our business, operations and reputation. Both in the United States and internationally, we must monitor and comply with a host of legal concerns regarding the content-based nature of our business. As an e-commerce platform, the scope of liability for third-party content uploaded to our site for sale on printed products requires analysis of varying definitions of political speech, hate speech, pornography, profanity and obscenity, among other speech-related concerns. We likewise must monitor our e-commerce platform for potential and alleged intellectual property infringement and violation of rights of privacy and publicity that can vary widely between countries and regions, and, accordingly, we frequently must navigate the legal and regulatory schemes of numerous countries outside the United States. Our ability to employ processes to quickly remove infringing or offending content from our automated upload website is an important tool in protecting us from exposure for the potentially infringing activities of our users worldwide. 
Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States, and in some cases internationally, have a direct impact on our business and operations. These laws include the following: 

• | The Copyright Act of 1976 and all of the statutes and regulations associated with and enforced by the United States Patent and Trademark Office which protect the rights of third parties from infringement by users of our service. We maintain an automated service whereby users can upload any content they designate for use in creating customized products, but we likewise maintain content usage policies that prohibit intellectual property rights infringement or infringement of the rights of others, including rights of privacy and publicity. We maintain a robust Intellectual Property Rights policy and a proactive support operation which responds to and manages take-down requests and other concerns relating to third-party intellectual property that might appear on our sites despite policies forbidding the practice. As our business expands to other countries, we must respond to regional and country-specific intellectual property considerations, including take down and cease and desist notices in foreign languages and we must continue to build infrastructure to support these processes globally. 


• | The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which provides relief for claims of infringement as it relates to circumvention of copyright protected technologies, but also includes a safe harbor intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others. We maintain DMCA-complaint practices for notice and take-down as well as other required practices such as repeat offender management. 


• | The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws adopted by a number of states, which regulate unsolicited commercial e-mails, create criminal penalties for unmarked sexually-oriented material and e-mails containing fraudulent headers and control other abusive online marketing practices. Similarly, the guidelines of the Federal Trade Commission imposes responsibilities upon us for communications with respect to consumers and imposes fines and liability for failure to comply with rules with respective advertising or marketing practices they may deem misleading or deceptive. Further, the European Union, or the E.U., also maintains standards and regulations with respect to communications with consumers that we must comply with as we expand our marketing practices into those countries.

• | Numerous product safety and environmental regulations that apply to the manufacture, sale and distribution of products and apply to our products and services to varying degrees based on the individual types of products sold through our portfolio of e-commerce websites and the inks used in our decorating processes. These regulations include, without limitation, the Consumer Product Safety Act, The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, California Proposition 65, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, as well as a number of other federal and state product safety and environmental regulatory schemes. Product safety regulations applicable to the E.U. in particular, where the majority of our international sales is currently shipped, are often more stringent than those in the United States and we therefore must evaluate and test applicable products to E.U. standards with respect to products intended for distribution in those markets. 


• | The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) and other state laws and regulations that relate to credit card and gift certificate use fairness, including expiration dates and fees, as well as state laws surrounding escheat and abandonment of unclaimed property.


• | In the United States and internationally, we must evaluate tax liabilities from transactions on our portfolio of e-commerce websites and maintain finance infrastructure to support the collection and remittance of applicable sales taxes. In the United States, sales tax nexus issues with respect to Internet sales to consumers in states where we do not have a physical presence, which create potential nexus through affiliate program marketing activities and other nascent efforts to imply tax nexus on royalties payable on content licenses. This regulation continues to be an area of great uncertainty and legal scrutiny both on a federal and state level, with over 27 states evaluating or imposing new legislation on various e-commerce activities or engaging in lawsuits with e-retailers. In Europe, we must comply with regulations with respect to customs, duties and V.A.T. as they apply to our business, sometimes on a country-by-country basis, which requires complex tracking and remittance processes. 


• | The Communications Decency Act of 1996, which gives statutory protection to online service providers for claims against interactive computer services providers who distribute third-party content.


• | The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which restricts the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and imposes additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors. In addition, the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances. 


• | Data privacy and security with respect to the collection of personally identifiable consumer information continues to be a focus of worldwide legislation and compliance review. Examples include statutes adopted by the State of California that require online services to report certain breaches of the security of personal data, and to report to California customers when their personal data might be disclosed to direct marketers. In the E.U., where U.S. companies must meet certain privacy and security standards, the Data Protection Directive requires comprehensive information privacy and security protections for consumers with respect to certain information collected about them. Compliance levels include disclosures, consents, transfer restrictions, notice and access provisions for which we may in the future need to build further infrastructure to further support. 

We expect and plan for new laws and regulations to be adopted over time that will be directly applicable to the Internet and to our activities. Any existing or new legislation applicable to our business could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations and potential penalties or fees for non-compliance, and could negatively impact the growth in the use of the Internet in general and our services in particular. We may also run the risk of retroactive application of new laws to our business practices that could result in liability or losses. As we continue to expand further into international territories, we expect the above-noted regulatory issues to also apply to such expansion as well as new issues to arise. Although we cannot presently anticipate all of the laws and regulations that might be applicable in new countries that we enter, we expect that legal issues applicable to our business in those countries will continue to arise as we assess and evaluate the scope of our operations in such countries. 
We post on our website our privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, Federal Trade Commission requirements or other privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings by governmental or regulatory bodies that could potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, there are a large number of legislative proposals before the United States Congress and various state legislative bodies regarding privacy issues related to our business. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted, and certain proposals, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in user registrations and revenue. These decreases could be caused by, among other possible provisions, the required use of disclaimers or other requirements before users can utilize our services. 
Due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to change previous regulatory schemes or choose to regulate its transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws. We 
7

Index to Financial Statements

might unintentionally violate such laws, such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We may be subject to legal liability for our online services. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad. Due to the nature of our content-rich automated upload service, claims are frequently alleged or asserted against us for trademark and copyright infringement and violation of rights of publicity to which we rapidly and expeditiously respond. We maintain content usage review systems that, through a combination of manual and automated blocks, monitor potentially infringing content of which we become aware. Nevertheless, claims may continue to be brought and threatened against us for negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of information, its origin and its distribution and there is no guarantee that we will be able to resolve any such claims quickly and without damage to us, our business model, our reputation or our operations. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
We work with a wide range of suppliers that provide raw materials, primarily ink, and blank inventory for customization. We have multiple sources for the various types of raw materials and blank inventory used in our business, and are therefore not dependent on a single source. We have historically worked with, and currently expect to continue to work with, two primary suppliers for apparel inventory, Hanesbrands, Inc. and Sun Apparel, but have access to many additional and alternative apparel suppliers. With respect to raw materials used in the printing process, we work with a number of suppliers, primarily digital printing equipment manufacturers, for the inks used in our digital printing processes, and have access to multiple alternate suppliers for ink. We do not have long-term supply agreements with any of our suppliers.
We believe the successful management of our supplier relationships is a key aspect of our business. We source our blank products from domestic and foreign manufacturers and distributors. Our current suppliers may not continue to sell merchandise to us on terms acceptable to us, and we may be unable to establish new or extend current supplier relationships to ensure a steady supply of blank inventory in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Under some of our current supply agreements for blank inventory, we enjoy flexible policies for returning the unsold items to our suppliers. We also source raw materials, principally the inks used in many of our digital printing processes, from a variety of digital printing manufacturers. If we are unable to accurately predict demand for the products that we are committed to purchase, we will be responsible for covering the cost of the products that we are unable to sell.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, within our continuing operations we had 316 full-time employees. Below is a summary of employees by function:

Cost of revenue | 146
Technology and development | 67 
Sales and marketing | 63 
General and administrative | 40 
Total | 316

During the peak holiday season, we hire contract workers on a temporary basis from third-party outsourcing firms. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we used approximately 1,200 temporary workers to assist in our production and fulfillment operations. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
