General 
Sears Holdings Corporation ("Holdings") is the parent company of Kmart Holding Corporation ("Kmart") and Sears, Roebuck and Co. ("Sears"). Holdings (together with its subsidiaries, "we," "us," "our," or the "Company") was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2004 in connection with the merger of Kmart and Sears (the "Merger") on March 24, 2005. We are an integrated retailer with significant physical and intangible assets, as well as virtual capabilities enabled through technology. At February 3, 2018, we operated a national network of stores with 1,002 full-line and specialty retail stores in the United States operating through Kmart and Sears. Further, we operate a number of websites under the sears.com and kmart.com banners which offer millions of products and provide the capability for our members and customers to engage in cross-channel transactions such as free store pickup; buy in store/ship to home; and buy online, return in store.
We are also the home of Shop Your Way®, a free membership program that connects its members to personalized products, programs and partners that help them save time and money every day. Through an extensive network of national and local partners, members can shop thousands of their favorite brands, dine out and access an array of exclusive partners like Uber® and fuboTV® to earn CASHBACK in points to redeem for savings on future purchases at Sears, Kmart, Lands' End and at ShopYourWay.com. The Sears MasterCard with Shop Your Way® features an industry-leading 5-3-2-1 rewards offer, where members can earn rewards points on all purchases everywhere they shop.
The Company is a leading home appliance retailer, as well as a leader in tools, lawn and garden, fitness equipment, automotive repair and maintenance, and is a significant player in the rapidly emerging connected solutions market. We offer key proprietary brands including Kenmore® and DieHard®, as well as Craftsman® branded product offerings. Our Kenmore and DieHard brands are also now available on Amazon.com. We also maintain a broad apparel and home offering including such well-known labels as Jaclyn Smith®, Joe Boxer®, Route 66®, Cannon®, Adam Levine® and Levi's® and also offer Lands' End® merchandise in some of our Full-line stores. We are the nation's No. 1 provider of appliance and product repair services, with over five million service calls made annually.
The retail industry is changing rapidly. The progression of the Internet, mobile technology, social networking and social media is fundamentally reshaping the way we interact with our core customers and members. As a result, we are transitioning to a member-centric company. Our focus continues to be on our core customers, our members, and finding ways to provide them value and convenience through Integrated Retail and our Shop Your Way membership platform. We have invested significantly in our membership program, our online ecommerce platforms and the technology needed to support these initiatives.

Real Estate Transactions 
In the normal course of business, we consider opportunities to purchase leased operating properties, as well as offers to sell owned, or assign leased, operating and non-operating properties. These transactions may, individually or in the aggregate, result in material proceeds or outlays of cash. In addition, we review leases that will expire in the short term in order to determine the appropriate action to take.
Further information concerning our real estate transactions is contained in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Trademarks and Trade Names
The KMART® and SEARS® trade names, service marks and trademarks, used by us both in the United States and internationally, are material to our retail and other related businesses. 
We sell proprietary branded merchandise under a number of brand names that are important to our operations. Our KENMORE® and DIEHARD® brands are among the most recognized proprietary brands in retailing. These marks are the subject of numerous United States and foreign trademark registrations. Other well recognized Company trademarks and service marks include ATHLETECH®, BLUELIGHT®, COVINGTON®, ROEBUCK & CO.®, SHOP YOUR WAY®, SMART SENSE®, STRUCTURE®, THOM MCAN®, and WALLY®, which also are registered or are the subject of pending registration applications in the United States. Generally, our rights in our trade names and marks continue so long as we use them.
Seasonality 
The retail business is seasonal in nature, and we generate a high proportion of our revenues, operating income and operating cash flows during the fourth quarter of our year, which includes the holiday season. As a result, our overall profitability is heavily impacted by our fourth quarter operating results. Additionally, in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season, we significantly increase our merchandise inventory levels, which are financed from operating cash flows, credit terms received from vendors and borrowings under our domestic credit agreement (described in the "Uses and Sources of Liquidity" section below). Fourth quarter reported revenues accounted for approximately 26% of total reported revenues in 2017, 27% of total reported revenues in 2016 and 29% of total reported revenues in 2015. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on revenues earned by quarter in 2017 and 2016. 
Competition 
Our business is subject to highly competitive conditions. We compete with a wide variety of retailers, including other department stores, discounters, home improvement stores, consumer electronics dealers, auto service providers, specialty retailers, wholesale clubs, as well as many other retailers operating on a national, regional or local level in the United States. Online and catalog businesses, which handle similar lines of merchandise, also compete with us. Walmart, Target, Kohl's, J.C. Penney, Macy's, The Home Depot, Lowe's, Best Buy and Amazon are some of the national retailers and businesses with which we compete. The Home Depot and Lowe's are major competitors in relation to our home appliance business, which accounted for approximately 16% of our 2017, 15% of our 2016 and 15% of our 2015 reported revenues. Success in these competitive marketplaces is based on factors such as price, product assortment and quality, service and convenience, including availability of retail-related services such as access to credit, product delivery, repair and installation. Additionally, we are influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost of goods, consumer debt availability and buying patterns, economic conditions, customer preferences, inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, weather patterns, and

catastrophic events. Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains further information regarding risks to our business.
