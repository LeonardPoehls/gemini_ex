  Business

 
  Overview
  
  We are an emerging over-the-counter (“OTC”) consumer goods and specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the commercialization, licensing and development of safe and effective non-prescription medicine, consumer care products, supplements and certain related devices to improve men’s and women’s health and vitality, urology, brain health, pain and respiratory diseases. We deliver innovative and uniquely presented and packaged health solutions through our (a) OTC medicines, devices, consumer and health products, and clinical supplements, which we market directly, (b) commercial retail and wholesale partners to primary care physicians, urologists, gynecologists and therapists, and (c) directly to consumers through our proprietary Beyond Human™ Sales & Marketing Platform including print media, on-line channels, websites, retailers and wholesalers. We are dedicated to being a leader in developing and marketing new OTC and branded Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) products, supplements and certain related devices. We are actively pursuing opportunities where existing prescription drugs have recently, or are expected to, change from prescription (or Rx) to OTC. These “Rx-to-OTC switches” require Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval through a process initiated by the New Drug Application (“NDA”) holder.
  
 Our business model leverages our ability to (a) develop and build our current pipeline of proprietary products, and (b) to also acquire outright or in-license commercial products that are supported by scientific and/or clinical evidence, place them through our existing supply chain, retail and on-line (including our Amazon®, eBay®, Wish.com, Sears.com, Walmart.com®, and Walgreens.com on-line stores and other e-commerce business platforms) channels to tap new markets and drive demand for such products and to establish physician relationships. We currently have 28 products marketed in the United States with 12 of those being marketed and sold in multiple countries around the world through some of our 18 international commercial partners. We currently expect to launch an additional seven to ten products in the U.S. in 2018 and we currently have approvals to launch certain of our already marketed products in at least six additional countries.
  
  Corporate Structure
  
 We incorporated in the State of Nevada. In December 2011, we merged with FasTrack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and changed our name to Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
  
 In December 2013, we acquired Semprae Laboratories, Inc., which had two commercial products in the U.S. and one in Canada. As a result, Semprae became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
  
 In February 2015, we entered into a merger agreement, whereby we acquired Novalere, Inc. and its worldwide rights to the FlutiCare® brand (fluticasone propionate nasal spray). 
  
  Our Strategy
  
 Our corporate strategy focuses on two primary objectives:
  
 
1. | Developing a diversified product portfolio of exclusive, unique and patented non-prescription OTC and branded ANDA drugs, devices, consumer health products, and clinical supplements through: (a) the introduction of line extensions and reformulations of either our or third-party currently marketed products; (b) the development of new proprietary OTC products, supplements and devices and (c) the acquisition of products or obtaining exclusive licensing rights to market such products; and
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Building an innovative, U.S. and global sales and marketing model through direct to consumer approaches such as our proprietary Beyond Human™ sales and marketing platform, the addition of new online platforms such as Amazon®, eBay®, Wish.com, Sears.com, Walmart.com® and Walgreens.com and commercial partnerships with established international complimentary partners that: (a) generates revenue, and (b) requires a lower cost structure compared to traditional pharmaceutical companies, thereby increasing our gross margins.

 We believe that our proven ability to market, license, acquire and develop brand name non-prescription pharmaceutical and consumer health products and devices uniquely positions us to commercialize our products and grow in this market in a differentiated way. The following are additional details about our strategy:
  
  ●
  Focusing on acquisition and licensing of commercial, non-prescription pharmaceutical and consumer health products, supplements and certain related devices that are well aligned with current therapeutic areas of male and female sexual health, urology, pain, vitality and respiratory diseases. In general, we seek non-prescription pharmaceutical (OTC monograph, Rx to OTC ANDA switched drugs) and consumer health products, supplements and certain related devices that are already marketed with scientific and/or clinical data and evidence that are aligned with our therapeutic areas, which we then can grow through promotion to physicians and expanding sales through our existing retail and online channels and commercial partners on a worldwide basis. We have done this through our acquisitions and licensing of (1) Sensum+® from Centric Research Institute or CRI, (2) Zestra® and Zestra Glide® from Semprae, (3) Vesele® from Trōphikōs, LLC, (4) U.S. and Canada rights to Androferti® from Laboratorios Q Pharma (Spain), (5) FlutiCare® from Novalere, (6) UriVarx® from Seipel Group, (7) Can-C® eye drops and supplement from International AntiAging Systems, (8) our 9 Beyond Human® supplements from Beyond Human, LLC, (9) MZS™, melatonin from International AntiAging Systems and (10) Musclin™ from the University of Iowa; 
 
  ●
  Increasing the number of U.S. non-exclusive distribution channel partners for print media, direct mailing and online sales and also open more channels directly to physicians, urologists, gynecologists and therapists . One of our goals is to increase the number of U.S. distribution channel partners that sell our products. To do this, we have devised a four-pronged approach. First, we are seeking to increase our print media and direct to consumer mailings for our products. Second, we are seeking to expand the number of OTC direct selling partners, such as the larger in-store retail and wholesale distributors for selected products, and to expand sales to the more regional, statewide and local distributors, such as regional pharmacy chains, large grocery stores and supplement and health stores for selected products. Third, we are working to expand our online presence through relationships with well-known online sellers and the building of our own platforms such as established Amazon®, eBay®, Wish.com, Sears.com, Walmart.com® and Walgreens.com among other stores. Fourth, we are seeking to expand sales of our OTC products directly through sampling programs and detailing to physicians, urologists, gynecologists, therapists and to other healthcare providers who generally are used to recommending to their patients products that are supported by strong scientific and/or clinical data and evidence;

 
  ●
  Seeking commercial partnerships outside the U.S. and developing consistent international commercial and distribution systems . We seek to develop a strong network of international distribution partners outside of the U.S. To do so, we are relying in part on past relationships that Dr. Bassam Damaj, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has had with certain commercial partners globally. In addition, we believe we have the ability to develop new relationships with commercial distributors who can demonstrate they have leading positions in their regions and can provide us with effective marketing and sales efforts and teams to detail our products to physicians and therapists. Our commercial partners outside the U.S. are responsible for storing, distributing and promoting our products to physicians, urologists, gynecologists, therapists and to other healthcare providers. We have already entered into 18 commercial partnerships covering our products in 110 countries outside the U.S.;

 
  ●
  Developing our own proprietary products and a proprietary patent and trademark portfolio to protect the therapeutic products and categories we desire to enter. We have developed certain of our products ourselves, such as Apeaz® for pain, Xyralid® for hemorrhoids and Diabasens™ a diabetic foot cream. We have filed and are working to secure patent claims in the U.S. and abroad covering product inventions and innovations that we believe are valuable. These patents, if issued and ultimately found to be valid, may enable us to create a barrier to entry for competitors on a worldwide basis. To date, we have four issued U.S. patents, seven U.S. patent applications, ten foreign patents, and four foreign patent applications. We also currently have 23 U.S. trademark registrations, 29 U.S. trademark applications, 25 foreign trademark registrations and 25 foreign trademark applications; and

 
  ●
  Achieving cost economies of scale from lower cost manufacturing, integrated distribution channels and multiple product discounts. We believe that we can achieve higher gross margins per product by shifting manufacturing to lower cost manufacturers. We also feel that we can acquire other OTC and consumer healthcare products and reintroduce them into our networks and sales and marketing platforms utilizing our integrated distribution and direct to consumer channels, thus receiving multiple product economies of scale from our distribution partners.

    (1)
  Vesele®

 
  Vesele® is a proprietary oral supplement of Arginine with high absorption backed with clinical use data in men and women for sexual dysfunction. Vesele® contains a patented formulation of L-Arginine and L-Citrulline in combination with the natural absorption enhancer Bioperine®. The beneficial effects of Vesele® on sexual and cognitive functions were confirmed in a four month U.S. clinical survey study involving 152 patients (69 men and 83 women). Results from the clinical survey have indicated (1) improvement of erectile hardness and maintenance in men and increased sexual intercourse frequency with their partners, and (2) lubrication in women, when taken separately by each.  
  
    (2)
  Zestra®

 
 Zestra® is our proprietary blend of essential oils proven in two peer-reviewed and published U.S. placebo controlled clinical trials in 276 women to increase desire, arousal and satisfaction. Zestra® is commercialized in the U.S. and Canada through major retailers, drug wholesalers such as McKesson and Cardinal Health and online.
  
 Female Sexual Arousal Disorder, or FSAD, is a disorder part of the Female Sexual Dysfunction, or FSD, and is characterized by the persistent or recurrent inability to attain sexual arousal or to maintain arousal until completion of sexual activity. 43% of women age 18-59 experience some sort of sexual difficulties with one approved prescription product (Laumann, E.O. et al. Sexual Dysfunction in the United States: Prevalence and Predictors. JAMA, Feb. 10, 1999. vol. 281, No. 6.537-542). The arousal liquid market is estimated to be around $500.0 million on a U.S. basis.

    (3)
  Zestra Glide®

 
 Zestra Glide® is a clinically tested water-based longer lasting lubricant. We acquired Zestra Glide® in our acquisition of Semprae in December 2013. In a 57 patient safety clinical study, Zestra Glide® proved to be safe and caused no irritation or skin side effects during the six week trial. To our knowledge, Zestra Glide® is the only water-based lubricant clinically tested for safety and has a viscosity of over 16000cps on the market. Increased viscosity usually translates into longer effects. The lubricant market is estimated to be around $200.0 million in the U.S. (Symphony IRI Group Study, 2012).
  
    (4)
  EjectDelay®

 
  EjectDelay® is our proprietary, clinical proven OTC FDA monograph compliant 7.5% benzocaine gel for premature ejaculation.  Benzocaine acts to inhibit the voltage-dependent sodium channels on the nerve membrane, stopping the propagation of the action potential and resulting in temporary numbing of the application site.  EjectDelay® is applied to the head of the penis ten minutes before intercourse.   Premature Ejaculation, or PE, is the absence of voluntary control over ejaculation resulting in ejaculation either preceding vaginal entry or occurring immediately upon vaginal entry and is defined as an ejaculation latency time of less than one minute. It is estimated that over 30% of males suffer from PE with a market size of $1.0 billion with a 10.3% annual growth rate. Topical anesthetics make up 14% of the total PE market (The Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2007 Sex Med 2007).
  
    (5)
  Sensum+®

 
 Sensum+® is a non-medicated cream which moisturizes the head and shaft of the penis for enhanced feelings of sensation and greater sexual satisfaction. It is a patent-pending blend of essential oils and ingredients generally recognized as safe that recently commenced marketing in the U.S. We acquired the global ex-U.S. distribution rights to Sensum+® from CRI. The safety and efficacy of Sensum+® was evaluated in two post-marketing survey studies in circumcised and non-circumcised men. A total of 382 men used Sensum+® twice daily for 14 consecutive days followed by once daily for eight weeks and as needed thereafter. Study participants reported a ~50% increase in penile sensitivity with the regular use of Sensum+®.

We currently expect to launch this product in 2019 pending successful clinical trials in patients with muscle wasting or cachexia.
  
 In addition to the above product pipeline, the Company currently intends to license and acquire other products that it may launch in 2018.
  
  Sales and Marketing Strategy U.S. and Internationally
  
  Our sales and marketing strategy is based on (a) the use of direct to consumer advertisements in print and online media through our proprietary Beyond Human™ sales and marketing platform acquired in March 2016, which in addition to the print includes extensive on-line media channels through our Amazon®, eBay®, Wish.com, Sears.com, Walgreens.com and Walmart.com® sites, over 170 websites and over 2.5 million subscribers, (b) working with direct retail and wholesale commercial channel partners in the U.S. and also directly marketing the products ourselves to physicians, urologists, gynecologists and therapists and to other healthcare providers, and (c) working with exclusive commercial partners outside of the U.S. that would be responsible for sales and marketing in those territories. We have now fully integrated most of our existing line of products such as Vesele®, Sensum+®, UriVarx®, Zestra®, RecalMax™, Xyralid®, FlutiCare®, Apeaz® and other products into the Beyond Human™ sales and marketing platform. We plan to integrate other products upon their commercial launches in 2018. We also market and distribute our products in the U.S. through retailers, wholesalers and other online channels. Our strategy outside the U.S. is to partner with companies who can effectively market and sell our products in their countries through their direct marketing and sales teams. The strategy of using our partners to commercialize our products is designed to limit our expenses and fix our cost structure, enabling us to increase our reach while minimizing our incremental spending.
  
  Our current OTC, Rx-to-OTC ANDA switch drugs and consumer care products marketing strategy is to focus on four main U.S. markets, all of which we believe to be each in excess of $1.0 billion: (1) Sexual health (female and male sexual dysfunction and health); (2) Urology (bladder and prostate health); (3) Respiratory disease;(4) Brain health; and (5) Pain. We will focus our current efforts on these four markets and will seek to develop, acquire or license products that we can sell through our sales channels in these fields.
  
  Manufacturers and Single Source Suppliers
  
 We use third-party manufacturers for the production of our products for development and commercial purposes. We believe there is currently excess capacity for manufacturing in the marketplace and opportunities to lower manufacturing cost through outsourcing to regions and countries that can do it in a more cost-effective basis. Some of our products are currently available only from sole or limited suppliers. We currently have multiple contract manufacturers for our multiple products and we issue purchase orders to these suppliers each time we require replenishment of our product inventory. All of our current manufacturers are based in the U.S. except for two based in Italy and we are looking to establish contract manufacturing for certain of our products in Europe and the Middle East and Northern Africa regions to reduce the cost and risk of supply chain to our current and potential commercial partners in their territories.
 Government Regulation
  
 Our products are normally subject to regulatory approval or must comply with various U.S. and international regulatory requirements. Unlike pharmaceutical companies who primarily sell prescription products, we currently sell drug or health products into the OTC market. While prescription products normally must progress from pre-clinical to clinical to FDA approval and then can be marketed and sold, our products are normally subject to conformity to FDA monograph requirements and similar requirements in other countries, which requires a shorter time frame for us to satisfy regulatory requirements and permits us to begin commercialization.
  
 Below is a brief description of the FDA regulatory process for our products in the U.S.
  
 
   
 
-8-



 
 

  U.S. Food and Drug Administration
  
 The FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products. These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.
  
 The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion and distribution of drugs in the U.S. under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the ("FFDCA"), and other statutes and implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
  ●
  Completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations;

 
  ●
  Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;

 
  ●
  For some products, performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s regulations, including Good Clinical Practices, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;

 
  ●
  Submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;

 
  ●
  Submission to the FDA of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA;

 
  ●
  Satisfactory completion of an FDA preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations; and

 
  ●
  FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.

 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
  
 Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies. The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted. The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator’s brochure. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin. Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements. An independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.
  
  Abbreviated New Drug Application
  
 An ANDA contains data which when submitted to FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of Generic Drugs, provides for the review and ultimate approval of a generic drug product. Once approved, an applicant may manufacture and market the generic drug product to provide a safe, effective, low cost alternative to the public than a bioequivalent prescription product.

 A generic drug product is one that is comparable to an innovator drug product in dosage form, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use.  Generic drug applications are termed "abbreviated" because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and effectiveness.  Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs in the same manner as the innovator drug).  One way scientists demonstrate bioequivalence is to measure the time it takes the generic drug to reach the bloodstream in 24 to 36 healthy, volunteers.  This gives them the rate of absorption, or bioavailability, of the generic drug, which they can then compare to that of the innovator drug.  The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patient's bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug.   
  
 Using bioequivalence as the basis for approving generic copies of drug products was established by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Waxman-Hatch Act. This Act expedites the availability of less costly generic drugs by permitting FDA to approve applications to market generic versions of brand-name drugs without conducting costly and duplicative clinical trials.  At the same time, the Act granted companies the ability to apply for up to five additional years of patent protection for the innovator drugs developed to make up for time lost while their products were going through the FDA's approval process. Brand-name drugs are subject to the same bioequivalence tests as generics upon reformulation.
  
  BioEquivalency Studies
  
 Studies to measure bioavailability and/or establish bioequivalence of a product are important elements in support of investigational new drug applications, or INDs, new drug applications, or NDAs, ANDAs and their supplements. As part of INDs and NDAs for orally administered drug products, bioavailability studies focus on determining the process by which a drug is released from the oral dosage form and moves to the site of action. Bioavailability data provide an estimate of the fraction of the drug absorbed, as well as its subsequent distribution and elimination. Bioavailability can be generally documented by a systemic exposure profile obtained by measuring drug and/or metabolite concentration in the systemic circulation over time. The systemic exposure profile determined during clinical trials in the IND period can serve as a benchmark for subsequent bioequivalence studies. Studies to establish bioequivalence between two products are important for certain changes before approval for a pioneer product in NDA and ANDA submissions and in the presence of certain post-approval changes in NDAs and ANDAs. In bioequivalence studies, an applicant compares the systemic exposure profile of a test drug product to that of a reference drug product. For two orally or intra-nasally administered drug products to be bioequivalent, the active drug ingredient or active moiety in the test product must exhibit the same rate. 
  
  OTC Monograph Process
  
 The FDA regulates certain non-prescription drugs using an OTC Monograph product designation which, when final, is published in the Code of Federal Regulations at 21 C.F.R. Parts 330-358. Such products that meet each of the conditions established in the OTC Monograph regulations, as well as all other applicable regulations, may be marketed without prior approval by the FDA.
  
 The general conditions set forth for OTC Monograph products include, among other things:
  
  ●
  The product is manufactured at FDA registered establishments and in accordance with cGMPs;

 
  ●
  The product label meets applicable format and content requirements including permissible “Indications” and all required dosing instructions and limitations, warnings, precautions and contraindications that have been established in an applicable OTC Monograph;

 
  ●
  The product contains only permissible active ingredients in permissible strengths and dosage forms;

 
  ●
  The product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered and do not interfere with the effectiveness of the preparation; and

 
  ●
  The product container and container components meet FDA’s requirements.

 
 The advertising for OTC drug products is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, which generally requires that advertising claims be truthful, not misleading, and substantiated by adequate and reliable scientific evidence. False, misleading or unsubstantiated OTC drug advertising may be subject to FTC enforcement action and may also be challenged in court by competitors or others under the federal Lanham Act or similar state laws. Penalties for false or misleading advertising may include monetary fines or judgments as well as injunctions against further dissemination of such advertising claims.
  
  A product marketed pursuant to an OTC Monograph must be listed with the FDA’s Drug Regulation and Listing System and have a National Drug Code listing, which is required for all marketed drug products. After marketing, the FDA may test the product or otherwise investigate the manufacturing and development of the product to ensure compliance with the OTC Monograph. Should the FDA determine that a product is not marketed in compliance with the OTC Monograph or is advertised outside of its regulations, the FDA may require corrective action up to and including market withdrawal and recall.

  Other Regulatory Requirements
  
 Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and international statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and, after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized. Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including:
  
  ●
  Meeting record-keeping requirements;

 
  ●
  Reporting of adverse experiences with the drug;

 
  ●
  Providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;

 
  ●
  Reporting on advertisements and promotional labeling;

 
  ●
  Drug sampling and distribution requirements; and

 
  ●
  Complying with electronic record and signature requirements.

 
 In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
  
 The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution and disgorgement of profit, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label or unapproved uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
  
  Competition
  
 The OTC pharmaceutical market is highly competitive with many established manufacturers, suppliers and distributors that are actively engaged in all phases of the business. We believe that competition in the sale of our products will be based primarily on efficacy, regulatory compliance, brand awareness, availability, product safety and price. Our brand name OTC pharmaceutical products may be subject to competition from alternate therapies during the period of patent protection and thereafter from generic or other competitive products. All of our existing products, and products we have agreements to acquire, compete with generic and other competitive products in the marketplace.
  
 Competing in the branded product business requires us to identify and quickly bring to market new products embodying technological innovations. Successful marketing of branded products depends primarily on the ability to communicate the efficacy, safety and value to healthcare professionals in private practice, group practices and managed care organizations. We anticipate that our branded product offerings will support our existing lines of therapeutic focus. Based upon business conditions and other factors, we regularly reexamine our business strategies and may from time to time reallocate our resources from one therapeutic area to another, withdraw from a therapeutic area or add an additional therapeutic area in order to maximize our overall growth opportunities.
  
 Some of our existing products, and products we have agreements to acquire, compete with one or more products marketed by very large pharmaceutical companies that have much greater financial resources for marketing, selling and developing their products. These competitors, as well as others, have been in business for a longer period of time, have a greater number of products on the market and have greater financial and other resources than we do. If we directly compete with them for the same markets and/or products, their financial and market strength could prevent us from capturing a meaningful share of those markets.
  
 We also compete with other OTC pharmaceutical companies for product line acquisitions as well as for new products and acquisitions of other companies.

  Research and Development
  
  We have used outside contract research organizations to carry out our research and development activities. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred research and development costs totaling $38,811, and $77,804, respectively. This decrease was a result of the cost of salary and the related health benefits for an employee in 2016 compared to 2017 and the conclusion of testing, non-human primate safety studies and clinical studies for our products Zestra®, Zestra Glide®, EjectDelay® and Sensum+® completed in 2016 compared to 2017. In addition, in 2016, we issued shares of common stock to CRI with a fair value of $23,000 for certain clinical and regulatory milestone payments due under the in-license agreement for Sensum+®.
