Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
St. Joseph, Inc. was organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on March 19, 1999 as Pottery Connection, Inc. Our Company was originally organized to produce and sell pottery of all forms, as well as arts and crafts through the Internet. On March 19, 2001, we changed our corporate name to St. Joseph Energy, Inc. in anticipation of changing our business purpose to the exploration and development of oil and gas properties. However, after unsuccessfully investing in two oil wells located in the State of Louisiana, we elected to abandon that endeavor and return to our original business purpose.
 
On November 6, 2003, we changed our corporate name to St. Joseph, Inc.
 
Staf*Tek was organized under the laws of the State of Oklahoma on January 2, 1997. On December 2, 2003, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Staf*Tek stock in exchange for (1) 380,500 shares of our Series A Preferred Shares (“Series A Shares”); (2) 219,500 shares of our common stock; and (3) $200,000 in cash. The acquisition closed on January 2, 2004, at which time Staf*Tek became a wholly owned subsidiary of St. Joseph.
 
We also hope to acquire other operating companies as subsidiaries and are pursuing suitable candidates for future acquisition that could potentially create value for our existing shareholders. Acquisition targets may be in sectors other than our current sector of providing employment agency services. Although it is not our goal, we would also consider a reverse merger opportunity, if it were seen to be a value creation opportunity for our existing shareholders.
 
To date, we have not consummated any acquisition and cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in this endeavor. Any acquisition may be structured as a share exchange and may result in significant dilution to our existing shareholders.

Staf*Tek Services, Inc.
 
During the years Staf*Tek was in operation the Company specialized in the recruiting and placement of professional technical personnel, as well as finance and accounting personnel on a temporary and permanent basis. Staf*Tek provides its customers with employee candidates with information technology (“IT”) skills in areas ranging from multiple platform systems integration to end-user support, including specialists in programming, networking, systems integration, database design, help desk support, including senior and entry level finance and accounting candidates. Staf*Tek’s candidate databases contain information on the candidates experience, skills, and performance and are continually being updated to include information on new referrals and to update information on existing candidates. Staf*Tek responds to a broad range of assignments from technical one-person assignments to major projects including, without limitation, Internet/Intranet development, desktop applications development, project management, enterprise systems development, SAP implementation and legacy mainframe projects. Staf*Tek also provides employee candidates computer training, online assessments, certification and the opportunity to be tested and certified in over 50 skill sets.

Competition
 
During operation Staf*Tek’s temporary and permanent staffing services face competition in attracting clients as well as high-quality specialized employment candidates. The temporary and permanent placement businesses are highly competitive, with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by Staf*Tek on a national, regional or local basis. In many areas the local companies are the most successful competitors. The most significant competitive factors in the temporary and permanent placement businesses are price and the reliability of service, both of which are often a function of the availability and quality of professional personnel. We believe that Staf*Tek derives a competitive advantage from its extensive experience and commitment to the specialized employment market, temporary employees placed by it are, in fact, Staf*Tek’s employees for all purposes while they are working on assignments. Once a professional is permanently placed, he or she either becomes an employee of Staf*Tek or of Staf*Tek’s client. During the temporary phase, Staf*Tek pays the related costs of employment, such as workers’ compensation insurance, state and federal unemployment taxes, social security and certain fringe benefits. Staf*Tek provides access to voluntary health insurance coverage to interested employees.
 
The Company has discontinued its temporary and permanent staffing services and may or may not restart operations depending on economics.
