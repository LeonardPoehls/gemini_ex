Item 1. Business
The Company
We are a leading global property information, analytics and data-enabled services provider operating in North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific. Our vision is to deliver unique property-level insights that power the global real estate economy. Our mission is to empower our clients to make smarter decisions through data-driven insights.
Our combined data from public, contributory and proprietary sources provides detailed coverage of property, mortgages and other encumbrances, property risk and replacement cost, consumer credit, tenancy, location, hazard risk and related performance information. We have more than one million users who rely on our data and predictive decision analytics to reduce risk, enhance transparency and improve the performance of their businesses.
We offer our clients a comprehensive national database covering real property and mortgage information, judgments and liens, building and replacement costs, parcel and geospatial data, criminal background records, eviction information, non-prime lending records, credit information, and tax information, among other data types. Our databases include over 900 million historical property transactions, over 100 million mortgage applications and property-specific data covering approximately 99% of U.S. residential properties, as well as commercial locations, totaling over 150 million records. We are also the industry's first parcel-based geocoder and have developed a proprietary parcel database covering more than 145 million parcels across the U.S. We believe the quality of the data we offer is distinguished by our broad range of data sources and our experience in aggregating, organizing, normalizing, processing and delivering data to our clients.
With our data as a foundation, we have built strong analytics capabilities and a variety of value-added business services to meet our clients’ needs for property tax processing, property valuation, mortgage and automotive credit reporting, tenancy screening, hazard risk, property risk and replacement cost, flood plain location determination and other geospatial data, analytics and related services.
We became a stand-alone public company on June 1, 2010 when we completed a transaction in which we separated from the financial services businesses of our predecessor company, The First American Corporation (referred to as the "Separation"). The First American Corporation was incorporated in California in 1894, and as part of the Separation, we reincorporated in Delaware on June 1, 2010, changed our name to CoreLogic, Inc. and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CLGX.” As used herein, the terms "CoreLogic," the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to CoreLogic, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, except where it is clear that the terms mean only CoreLogic, Inc. and not our subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located at 40 Pacifica, Irvine, California, 92618-7471, our telephone number is (949) 214-1000, and our website is www.corelogic.com.
Corporate Events
Acquisitions
In August 2017, we completed the acquisitions of Mercury Network, LLC ("Mercury"), Myriad Development, Inc. ("Myriad") and Clareity Ventures, Inc. ("Clareity") for total cash of approximately $189.4 million. The acquisition of Myriad included contingent consideration of up to $3.0 million, to be paid in cash in 2019 upon the achievement of certain revenue targets in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. See Note 16 - Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.    
Financing Activities
In August 2017, we amended and restated our credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A. as the administrative agent, and other financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.8 billion five-year term A loan facility (the “Term Facility”), and a $700.0 million five-year revolving credit facility ("Revolving Facility). The Term Facility matures and the Revolving Facility expires in August 2022. The Revolving Facility includes a $100.0 million multicurrency revolving sub-facility and a $50.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. The Credit Agreement also provides for the ability to increase the Term Facility and Revolving Facility by up to $100.0 million in the aggregate; however, the lenders are not obligated to do so. See Note 8 - Long Term Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

Our Data
Our data is the foundation of many of our products, analytics and services, and can generally be categorized as property information, mortgage information and consumer information. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, data gathered from public sources, data contributed by our clients and data obtained from data aggregators.
We gather a variety of data from public sources, including data and documents from federal, state and local governments. We enhance our public record information with the data we collect from other public and non-public sources to create comprehensive textual and geospatial views of each property within our coverage areas, including physical property characteristics, boundaries and tax values, current and historical ownership, voluntary and involuntary liens, tax assessments and delinquencies, replacement cost, property risk including environmental, flood and hazard information, criminal data, building permits, local trends and summary statistics.
Our client agreements typically govern the use of our client-contributed data. These contractual arrangements often permit our clients to use our solutions which incorporate their data. We generally structure our client agreements to specify the particular uses of the data our clients contribute and to provide the required levels of data privacy and protection. Our contributed data includes loan performance information (from loan servicers, trustees, securitizers, issuers and others), appraisal information, information regarding property rental and under-banked loan applications from various loan originators, and information regarding landlords and property owners. 
In addition, we gather property listing and tenant/landlord rental information from Boards of Realtors®, real estate agents, brokers, landlords, and owners of multi-tenant properties. We collect appraisals and property valuations from appraisers and we license consumer credit history information from credit reporting agencies, lenders and auto dealers.
Business Segments
We have organized our business into the following two segments: Property Intelligence & Risk Management Solutions ("PIRM") and Underwriting & Workflow Solutions ("UWS"). In December 2017, we refined our operating segments to reflect our ongoing strategic transformation into a scaled provider of unique property insight, risk management and underwriting solutions. Information included herein reflects this updated segmentation for all periods presented.
We believe that we hold the leading market position for many of our solutions, including:

• | property tax processing, based on the number of loans under service;


• | flood zone determinations, based on the number of flood zone certification reports issued;


• | credit and income verification services to the U.S. mortgage lending industry, based on the number of credit reports issued;


• | property valuation and technology platform solutions, based on the number of in-house staff appraisers and inquiries received; and


• | multiple listing services ("MLS"), based on the number of active desktops using our technology.

In addition to our two reporting segments, we also have a corporate group, which includes costs and expenses not allocated to our segments.
The following table sets forth our operating revenue for the last three years from our segments:

(in thousands) | 2017 | | % of Total Operating Revenue | | 2016 | | % of Total Operating Revenue | | 2015 | | % of Total Operating Revenue
PIRM | $ | 703,032 | | | 37.9 | % | | $ | 706,496 | | | 36.2 | % | | $ | 712,335 | | 46.6 | %
UWS | 1,157,432 | | | 62.5 | | | 1,256,841 | | | 64.4 | | | 825,339 | | | 54.0 | 
Corporate and Eliminations | (9,347 | ) | | (0.4 | ) | | (10,780 | ) | | (0.6 | ) | | (9,564 | ) | | (0.6 | )
Operating revenue | $ | 1,851,117 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 1,952,557 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 1,528,110 | | 100.0 | %

More detailed financial information regarding each of our business segments as well as information about our operating revenue attributed to domestic and foreign operations is included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 18 - Segment Financial Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of Part II of this report.
Solutions
Property Intelligence & Risk Management Solutions
Our PIRM segment combines property information, mortgage information and consumer information to deliver unique housing market and property-level insights, predictive analytics and risk management capabilities. We have also developed proprietary technology and software platforms to access, automate or track this information and assist our clients with decision-making and compliance tools in the real estate industry, insurance industry and the single and multifamily industry. We deliver this information directly to our clients in a standard format over the web, through hosted software platforms or in bulk data form. Our solutions include property insights and insurance & spatial solutions in North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific.
Our property insights combine our patented predictive analytics and proprietary and contributed data to enable our clients to improve customer acquisition and retention, detect and prevent fraud, improve mortgage transaction cycle time and cost efficiency, identify real estate trends and neighborhood characteristics, track market performance and increase market share. Our data is comprised of real estate information with crime, site inspection, neighborhood, document images and other information from proprietary sources. We also provide verification of applicant income, identity and certain employment verification services using Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and Social Security Administration databases as well as third-party employment data providers. Further, we maintain the leading market share of real estate listing software systems, with provisioning to more than 50% of all U.S. and Canadian real estate agents. We also provide a full range of professional services to listing organizations and assist our clients in identifying revenue opportunities and improving member services.
Our insurance & spatial solutions provide originators and property and casualty insurers the solutions required to more effectively locate, assess and manage property-level assets and risks through location-based data and analytics. In addition to the industry's first parcel-based geocoder and a proprietary parcel database covering more than 145 million parcels across the U.S., we maintain critical and up-to-date information across multiple hazard databases including information on damaging winds and sinkholes, flood data and the location of fire stations. Our analytics and hazard data are delivered to customers through multiple methods, including proprietary platforms targeted to insurance industry participants.
Underwriting & Workflow Solutions
Our UWS segment combines property information, mortgage information and consumer information to provide comprehensive mortgage origination and monitoring solutions, including underwriting-related solutions and data-enabled valuations and appraisals. We have also developed proprietary technology and software platforms to access, automate or track this information and assist our clients with vetting and on-boarding prospects, meeting compliance regulations and understanding, diagnosing and monitoring property values. Our solutions include property tax solutions, valuation solutions, credit solutions and flood services in North America.
Our property tax solutions are built from aggregated property tax information from over 20,000 taxing authorities. We use this information to advise mortgage originators and servicers of the property tax payment status of loans in their portfolio and to monitor that status over the life of the loans. If a mortgage lender requires tax payments to be impounded on behalf of its borrowers, we can also monitor and oversee the transfer of these funds to the taxing authorities and provide the lender with payment confirmation.
Our valuations solutions represent property valuation-related data-driven services and analytics combined with collateral valuation workflow technologies, which assist our clients in assessing risk of loss using both traditional and alternative forms of property valuation, driving process efficiencies, and ensuring compliance with lender and governmental regulations. We have been building collateral risk management models for more than 20 years and provide collateral information technology and solutions that automate property appraisal ordering, tracking, documentation and review for lender compliance with government regulations.
Our credit solutions have access to one of the largest consumer and business databases, which enables us to provide credit and income verification services to the mortgage and automotive industries. We provide comprehensive information 
 5

about credit history, income verification and home address history. We normalize our data to provide a broad range of advanced business information solutions designed to reduce risk and improve business performance.
Our flood data solutions provide flood zone determinations in accordance with the U.S. Federal legislation passed in 1994, which requires that most mortgage lenders obtain a determination of the current flood zone status at the time each loan is originated and obtain applicable updates during the life of the loan. We provide flood zone determinations primarily to mortgage lenders.
Clients
Our clients are predominantly financial services institutions in the mortgage and insurance industries. We provide our solutions to national and regional mortgage lenders, servicers, brokers, credit unions, commercial banks, investment banks, fixed-income investors, real estate agents, MLS companies, property management companies, real estate investment trusts, property and casualty insurance companies, government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises.
Our more significant client relationships tend to be long-term in nature and we typically provide a number of different solutions to each client. Because of the depth of these relationships, we derive a significant portion of our aggregate revenue from our largest clients, with 38.7% of our 2017 operating revenues being generated by our ten largest clients. One of our clients, Bank of America, accounted for 11.1% of our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
Competition
We offer a diverse array of specialized products and services that compete directly and indirectly with similar products and services offered by national and local providers. We believe there is no single competitor who offers the same combination of products and services that we do. Therefore, we believe that we compete with a broad range of entities.
Our PIRM segment competes with entities that provide access to data or data-based analytics products and services as part of their product offerings, including Black Knight Financial Services, which provides real estate information, analytics, valuation-related services and other solutions, ATTOM Data, which provides public records data, First American, which provides real estate, home ownership and property data, Verisk Analytics, Inc., which provides data and risk assessment in the insurance and financial services industries, and RealPage, Inc. and Yardi Systems, Inc., which provide services in the multifamily residential industry. We also compete with departments within financial institutions that utilize internal resources to provide similar analytics and services on a captive basis. We compete based on the breadth and quality of our data sets, the exclusive nature of some of our key data sets, the quality and effectiveness of our products and the integration of our platforms into client systems. We believe the data we offer is distinguished by quality, the broad range of our data sources (including non-public sources), the volume of records we maintain and our ability to provide data spanning a historical period of time that exceeds comparable data sets of most of our competitors.
Our UWS segment competes with third-party providers such as Black Knight, Inc. and Lereta LLC, which provide tax and flood services, as well as credit and screening solutions providers such as Equifax, Inc., Credit Plus, and Kroll Factual Data, and Clear Capital, Solidifi and ServiceLink, which provide valuation-related services. For these services, we compete largely based on the quality of the products and services we provide, our ability to provide scalable services at competitive prices and our ability to provide integrated platforms. We also compete with departments within financial institutions that utilize internal resources to provide similar services on a captive basis. We generally compete with captive providers based on the quality of our products and services, the scalability of our services, cost efficiencies and our ability to provide some level of risk mitigation.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales strategy is client-focused and resources are primarily assigned based on client size and complexity. Several of our sales team members and subject matter experts specialize in specific solutions, products and services. Each of our sales executives develops and maintains key relationships within each client’s business units and plays an important role in relationship management as well as developing new business. Our sales executives understand the current marketplace environment and demonstrate extensive knowledge of our clients’ internal operating structure and business needs. The depth and breadth of our relationships with our clients allows us to develop and implement solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of each client in a prompt and efficient manner.
 6

Smaller clients, measured by revenue or geographic coverage, are primarily managed through our inside sales operations function which is responsible for working with mortgage and real estate brokers, smaller property and casualty insurance companies, fixed-income investors, appraisers, real estate agents, correspondents and other lenders.
Several of our product and service lines have sales teams and subject matter experts who specialize in specific solutions, products and services. These sales teams and subject matter experts work collaboratively with our sales executives and our inside sales operations to assist with client sales by combining our data, products and data-enabled services to meet the specific needs of each client, and may be assigned to assist with sales in targeted markets, for certain categories of clients or for particular service groups.
Our marketing strategy is to accelerate growth by building trusted relationships with our clients and delivering superior value through unique property-related data, analytics and data-enabled solutions. We use the most efficient methods available to successfully identify, target, educate and engage potential and existing clients through their preferred channel of communication. Employing client-centric marketing initiatives and campaigns, we clearly articulate our value proposition to build awareness, familiarity and interest in our business solutions, build demand for our products and services, and increase volume, quality and velocity of sales opportunities. Our marketing activities include direct marketing, advertising, public relations, event marketing, digital marketing, social media and other targeted activities.
 Acquisitions and Divestitures
Historically, we have accelerated our growth into new markets, products and services through selective acquisitions that we believe strengthen our overall solution offerings and value proposition to clients. We continually evaluate our business mix and opportunistically seek to optimize our business portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures.
Intellectual Property
We own significant intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent) and contractual safeguards in an intellectual property enforcement program to protect our intellectual property rights.
We have more than 50 issued patents in the U.S. covering business methods, software and systems patents, principally relating to automated valuation, fraud detection, data gathering, flood detection, MLS technology and property monitoring. We also have approximately 30 patent applications pending in these and other areas in the U.S. In addition, we have a number of issued patents and pending patent applications internationally, including in Canada and Australia. The protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we intend to continue to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business.
In addition, we own more than 300 trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries, including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered. Many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks and logos are material to our business, as they assist our clients in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
We own more than 1,000 registered copyrights in the U.S. and foreign countries, covering computer programs, reports and manuals. We also have other literary works, including marketing materials, handbooks, presentations and website content that are protected under common law copyright. We believe our written materials are essential to our business as they provide our clients with insight into various areas of the financial and real estate markets in which we operate.
Our research and development activities focus primarily on the design and development of our analytical tools, software applications, and data sets. We expect to continue our practice of investing in the development of new software applications and systems in response to the market and client needs we identify through client input collected in meetings, phone calls and web surveys. We also assess opportunities to integrate existing data sets to enhance our products' effectiveness. 
In order to maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with our clients, granting rights to use our products and services, including our software and databases. We also audit our clients from time to time to ensure compliance with our agreements. This helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions. As a general practice, employees, contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information enter into agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.

Information Technology
Information technology is a significant focus area and we maintain a long-term strategic technology plan which is reassessed annually. Our information technology initiatives are driven by internal technology staff with support from a number of external technology firms. Our existing technology infrastructure is a private, dedicated cloud-based computing environment hosted in a primary and secondary technology center located in Quincy, Washington and Plano, Texas, respectively. These technology centers were formerly run by Dell and are now owned and managed by the NTT Data Corporation ("NTT").
We maintain a global innovation center ("GIC"), headquartered in Dallas, Texas, which is developing our next generation product platforms and software applications. In addition, the GIC plays a leading role in research and development in the areas of employing hardware advancements, data and analytics, mobility and the application of machine learning and mobility solutions. We supplement the GIC with a number of strategic alliances, including most notably Pivotal Software, Inc.
Technology Operations
Our private, dedicated cloud computing environment hosted by NTT is designed to enable us to deliver secure and compliant data, analytics and services to support client needs. This network of systems, combined with enterprise-level service operations, positions us as a leading property insights provider to the financial services market. Additionally, our platform stores, processes and delivers our data and our proprietary technologies that are the foundation of our business and critical to the development of our solutions. In conjunction with NTT, we operate a computing technology environment intended to allow us to provide flexible systems at all times, enabling us to deliver increased capacity as needed or when client needs demand increased speed of delivery. Additionally, our unified network architecture allows us to operate multiple systems as a single resource capable of delivering our applications, data and analytics as a combined solution to our clients.
Security
We have deployed a wide range of physical and technology security measures, along with a formal governance program, designed to secure our information technology infrastructure, personnel and data. Our governance program is based on corporate information security policies, an information security awareness training program along with an enterprise compliance program. Both our technology managers and NTT’s technology infrastructure managers are Information Technology Infrastructure Library certified. NTT is contractually obligated to comply with our information security policies and procedures. Our digital security framework provides layered protection designed to secure both active and inactive virtual machines in the data centers we use. This approach enables dedicated virtual machines to regularly scan all of our systems. These measures help to detect and prevent intrusions, monitor firewall integrity, inspect logs, catch and quarantine malware and prevent data breaches. Our physical and virtual security solutions run in tandem, enabling us to better identify suspicious activities and implement preventive measures.
Regulation
Various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal and state regulation. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide certain services, as well as the possible imposition of fines and penalties. Among the more significant areas of regulation for our business are the following:
Privacy and Protection of Consumer Data
For our businesses that involve the collection, processing and distribution of personal public and non-public data, certain of their solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, foreign countries. These laws impose requirements regarding the collection, protection, use and distribution of some of the data we have, and provide for sanctions and penalties in the event of violations of these requirements. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") serves as the principal federal regulator of providers of consumer financial products and services. As such, the CFPB has significant rulemaking authority under existing federal statutes that regulate many of our products and services, as well as the authority to conduct examinations of certain providers of financial products and services. Under the CFPB's authority to supervise larger market participants of the credit reporting market, the CFPB has the authority to conduct examinations of our covered businesses. The CFPB also has the authority to initiate an investigation of our other businesses if it believes that a federal consumer financial law is being violated.
 8

In terms of specific regulations applicable to us, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA") regulates the sharing of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions. In addition to regulating information sharing, the GLBA requires that non-public personal financial information be safeguarded using physical, administrative and technological means. Certain of the non-public personal information we hold is subject to protection under the GLBA.
The Drivers Privacy Protection Act prohibits the public disclosure, use or resale by any state's department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record, except for a “permissible purpose.”
Other federal and state laws also impose requirements relating to the privacy of information held by us. In addition, certain state laws may impose breach notice responsibilities in the event of the loss of data due to third-party security breaches, employee error, or other event resulting in persons gaining unauthorized access to our data (including, in some cases, for losses that are incurred through our clients' errors or systems).
The privacy and protection of consumer information remains a developing area and we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments at the federal, state and local levels. We expect that there will be enhanced regulation in the area of financial and consumer data privacy. Any such additional regulation could significantly impact some of our business practices. It is too early to assess the financial and operational impact to our business of any heightened regulation.
Regulation of Credit Reporting Businesses
The Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") governs the practices of consumer reporting agencies that are engaged in the business of collecting and analyzing certain types of information about consumers, including credit eligibility information. The FCRA also governs the submission of information to consumer reporting agencies, the access to and use of information provided by consumer reporting agencies and the ability of consumers to access and dispute information held about them. Some our databases and services are subject to regulation under the FCRA. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank Act") gave the CFPB supervisory authority over “larger participants” in the market for consumer financial services, as the CFPB defines by rule. In July 2012, the CFPB finalized its regulation regarding larger participants in the consumer reporting market. Under the regulation, certain of our credit services businesses are considered larger participants. As a result, the CFPB has the authority to conduct examinations of the covered credit services businesses, and we expect that we will continue to be examined by the CFPB as part of this authority.
Regulation of Settlement Services
The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ("RESPA") is enforced by the CFPB. RESPA generally prohibits the payment or receipt of fees or any other item of value for the referral of real estate-related settlement services. RESPA also prohibits fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services, such as mortgage brokerage services and real estate brokerage services. Notwithstanding these prohibitions, RESPA permits payments for goods furnished or for services actually performed, so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided. Our mortgage origination-related businesses that supply credit reports, flood and tax services, valuation products, and all other settlement services to residential mortgage lenders are structured and operated in a manner intended to comply with RESPA and related regulations.
Regulation of Property Valuation Activities
Real estate appraisals and automated valuation models ("AVMs") are subject to federal and state regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented rules and guidance thereunder, and inter-agency guidance jointly issued by the federal financial institution regulators have expanded regulation of these activities. Regulations address appraisals, AVMs and other forms of property value estimates, which are subject to explicit and detailed regulations including licensing, pricing and quality control requirements. In addition, creditors are required to disclose information to applicants about the purpose, and provide consumers with a free copy, of any appraisal, AVM or other estimate of a home's value developed in connection with a residential real estate mortgage loan application.
In addition, the increased regulation of the residential mortgage lending industry has created opportunities for expanded use of property valuation tools. 
 9

Other Regulations
In addition to the foregoing areas of regulation, several of our other businesses are subject to regulation, including the following:

• | Our tenant screening business is subject to certain landlord-tenant laws and insurance agency laws;


• | Our loan document business must monitor state laws applicable to our clients relating to loan documents and fee limitations as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac requirements to develop and maintain compliant loan documents and other instruments; and


• | Our activities in foreign jurisdictions are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and comparable foreign laws.

We do not believe that compliance with current and future laws and regulations related to our businesses, including consumer protection laws and regulations, will have a material adverse effect on us, but such activities will likely increase our compliance costs.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 5,900 employees, of which approximately 5,200 were employed in the U.S. and 700 outside the U.S.
Available Information
We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. 
Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are also available free of charge through the "Investors" page on our Internet site at http://www.corelogic.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part hereof or incorporated into this or any of our other filings with the SEC.
