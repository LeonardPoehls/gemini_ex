ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
We are a full-service regional bank holding company focused on relationship-based business and agribusiness banking. We serve our customers through 173 branches in attractive markets in nine states: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. We were established more than 80 years ago and have achieved strong market positions by developing and maintaining extensive local relationships in the communities we serve. By leveraging our business and agribusiness focus, highly efficient operating model, robust approach to risk management and presence in attractive markets, we have achieved steady and profitable growth—both organically and through disciplined acquisitions. We have successfully completed nine acquisitions since 2006, including our 2010 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, assisted acquisition of TierOne Bank, which represented approximately $2.54 billion in acquired assets, and our 2016 acquisition of HF Financial Corp. ("HF Financial"), which represented approximately $1.12 billion of acquired assets. Our net income was $144.8 million for fiscal year 2017 and our loans and total assets were $9.01 billion and $11.69 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2017.
We focus on business and agribusiness banking, complemented by retail banking and wealth management services. Our loan portfolio consists primarily of business loans, comprised of commercial real estate ("CRE") loans, agribusiness loans and commercial non-real estate loans. At September 30, 2017, our business and agribusiness loans collectively accounted for 88.4% of our total loan portfolio. In addition, 67.2% of our aggregate loan portfolio, comprising 45.8% of CRE loans, 11.1% of agriculture real estate loans and 10.3% of residential real estate loans, was primarily secured by interests in real estate predominantly located in the states in which we operate. In addition, some of our other lending occasionally involves taking real estate as primary or secondary collateral. We offer small and mid-sized businesses a focused suite of financial products and have established strong relationships across a diversified range of sectors, including key areas supporting regional growth such as hospitality/tourism, agribusiness services, freight and transport and healthcare. We have developed extensive expertise in agribusiness lending, which serves one of the most prominent industries across our markets, and we offer a variety of financial services designed to meet the specific needs of our agribusiness customers. We also provide a range of deposit and loan products to our retail customers through several channels, including our branch network, online banking system, mobile banking applications and customer care centers. In our wealth management business, we seek to expand our private banking, financial planning, investment management and insurance operations to better position us to capture an increased share of the business of managing the private wealth of many of our business and agribusiness customers.

Our banking model seeks to balance the best of being a “big enough” and a “small enough” bank, providing capabilities typical of a much larger bank, such as diversified product specialists, customized banking solutions and multiple delivery channels, with a customer-focused culture usually associated with smaller banks. Our focus on balancing these capabilities with a service-oriented culture is embedded within our operations and is enhanced by focusing on our core competencies. We are well recognized within our markets for our relationship-based banking model that provides for local, efficient decision making. We believe we serve our customers in a manner that is responsive, flexible and accessible. Our relationship bankers strive to build deep, long-term relationships with customers and understand the customers’ specific needs to identify appropriate financial solutions. We believe we have been successful in attracting customers and bankers from larger competitors because of our flexible approach and the speed and efficiency with which we provide banking solutions to our customers while maintaining disciplined underwriting standards. 
Our Business Strategy
We believe that stable long-term growth and profitability are the result of building strong customer relationships while maintaining disciplined underwriting standards. We plan to focus on originating high-quality loans and growing our cost-effective deposit base through our relationship-based business and agribusiness banking approach. We believe that continuing to focus on our core strengths will enable us to gain market share, continue to improve our operational efficiency and increase profitability. The key components of our strategy for continued success and future growth include the following: 
Attract and Retain High-Quality Relationship Bankers
A key component of our growth in our existing markets and entry into new markets has been our ability to attract and retain high-quality relationship bankers. We have recruited approximately 71 new business and agribusiness relationship bankers since January 1, 2012 (out of a total of approximately 192 business and agribusiness relationship bankers at September 30, 2017), with average industry experience of over 15 years when hired. We believe we have been successful in recruiting qualified relationship bankers due primarily to our decentralized management approach, focused product suite and flexible and customer-focused culture while continuing to provide sophisticated banking capabilities to serve our customers’ needs. We intend to continue to hire experienced relationship bankers to execute our relationship-driven banking model. We utilize a variable compensation structure designed to incentivize our relationship bankers by tying their compensation to both the performance of the Company and their individual overall performance. We measure individual banker performance based on revenue, loans originated, deposits raised and asset quality/risk, among other performance measurements. We believe this structure establishes the appropriate incentives to serve our customers' needs, maintain strong performance and satisfy our risk management objectives. By leveraging the strong networks and reputation of our experienced relationship bankers, we believe we can continue to grow our loan portfolio and deposit base as well as offer customers a range of products and services to fulfill their financial needs. 
Optimize Footprint in Existing and Complementary Markets
We pursue attractive growth opportunities to expand within our existing footprint and enter new markets aligned with our business model and strategic plans. We believe we can increase our presence in under-represented areas in our existing markets and broaden our footprint in attractive markets adjacent and complementary to our current markets by continuing our emphasis on business and agribusiness banking. Our branch strategy is guided by our ability to recruit experienced relationship bankers in under-represented and new markets. These bankers expand our banking relationships into these markets prior to opening a branch, which increases our likelihood of expanding profitably by developing an asset and/or deposit base before we establish a branch in that market. We will continue to opportunistically consider opening new branches. We intend to capitalize on growth opportunities we believe exist in growing economies in and adjacent to our existing markets. 
 6

Deepen Customer Relationships
We believe that our reputation, expertise and relationship-based banking model enable us to deepen our relationships with our customers. We look to leverage our relationships with existing customers by offering a range of products and services suitable to their needs such as online and mobile banking for consumer customers. We have sought to grow our low-cost customer deposit base by attracting more deposits from our business and agribusiness customers. We offer alternative cash management solutions intended to help retain business customers. We seek to expand and enhance our wealth management platform through focused product offerings that we believe will appeal to our more affluent customers. We intend to continue to capitalize on opportunities to capture more business from existing customers throughout our banking network. During fiscal year 2017, we continued to enhance our online and mobile banking platforms to enable person-to-person payments, online stop payments, and reward our customers for purchases made with their debit cards. With our new Online Account Opening, customers may open a checking account in minutes direct from their mobile phone. Our commercial customers now enjoy faster startup and simplified access to their banking information. We believe these enhancements are more competitive product offerings and expect them to contribute to growth in deposit balances over time. 
Continue to Improve Efficiency and Manage Costs
We believe that our focus on operational efficiency, even in light of incremental costs related to being a public company with over $10 billion in consolidated total assets, is critical to our profitability and future growth. We intend to carefully manage our cost structure and continuously refine and implement internal processes to create further efficiencies and enhance our earnings. We believe our scalable systems, risk management infrastructure and operating model will better enable us to achieve further operational efficiencies as we grow our business. 
Opportunistically Pursue Acquisitions
Our management team has extensive expertise and a successful track record in evaluating, executing and integrating attractive, franchise-enhancing acquisitions. We have successfully completed nine acquisitions since 2006, including our 2010 FDIC assisted acquisition of TierOne Bank, which represented approximately $2.54 billion in acquired assets, and our 2016 acquisition of HF Financial, which represented approximately $1.12 billion in acquired assets. We will continue to consider acquisitions that are consistent with our business strategy and financial model as opportunities arise. Illustrated below, as of September 30 of each indicated year, is the growth in our total assets, including the amount attributed as a result of acquisitions in that fiscal year.

Our Operating Model
We believe our highly efficient and scalable operating model has enabled us to operate profitably, remain competitive, increase market share and develop new business. We emphasize company-wide operating principles focused on proactive expense management, targeted investment, disciplined lending practices and focused product offerings. We have achieved cost efficiencies by consolidating our branch network through the closure of less profitable locations and through our demonstrated success in acquiring and integrating banks. We believe our focus on operating efficiency has contributed significantly to our return on equity, return on assets and net income.
Our Prior Relationship With NAB
We were formed as a Delaware corporation in July 2014 as a wholly owned subsidiary of National Americas Holdings LLC ("NAH") to be the publicly traded holding company for our bank.  NAH was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 2008 by NAB to facilitate NAB’s purchase of our bank. In connection with our initial public offering in October 2014, we purchased all outstanding common stock issued by Great Western Bancorporation, Inc. ("GWBCI"), an Iowa corporation formed in 1968 which was then the holding company for our bank, from National Americas Investments, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of NAH. Following this purchase, GWBCI was merged with and into us and we continue as the surviving corporation succeeding to all the assets, liabilities and business of GWBCI. We conduct our business through our bank as a single reportable segment, with all of our identifiable assets located in the United States.
Prior to our initial public offering, we were an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NAB. NAB sold 18.4 million shares, representing 31.8% of our common stock, in the initial public offering. On May 6, 2015, NAB sold 23.0 million shares of our common stock, representing 39.7% of the common stock, in the second stage of its planned divestiture. On July 31, 2015, NAB sold all of its remaining shares of our common stock in a secondary public offering of 13.8 million shares and a concurrent share repurchase transaction in which we acquired 2.7 million shares from NAB to fully divest its ownership. There are no debts payable to NAB and its affiliates remaining. 
Our Business Lines
Business Banking 
Business banking is a key focus of our business model and is one of our core competencies. We provide business banking services to small and mid-sized businesses across a diverse range of industries, including key sectors supporting regional growth such as hospitality/tourism, ancillary agribusiness services (e.g., farm equipment suppliers and grain and seed merchants), freight and transport and healthcare (e.g., hospitals, physicians, care facilities and dentists). We offer our business banking customers a focused range of financial products designed to meet the specific needs of their businesses, including loans, lines of credit, cash management services, online business deposit and wire transfer services, in addition to non-interest-bearing demand deposit and savings accounts and corporate credit cards. At September 30, 2017, business banking represented $2.87 billion in deposits, an increase of $262.8 million from September 30, 2016, and $5.84 billion in loans, an increase of $416.4 million over the same period, which represents 32.0% and 64.9%, respectively, of our total deposits and loans. 
Our business banking model is based on a fundamental understanding of the communities we serve and the banking needs of our customers. Our bank employs experienced relationship bankers across our footprint, each of whom offers our bank’s suite of business banking products and services to our customers. Our relationship bankers strive to build deep, long-term customer relationships with our banking customers and to understand our customers’ specific needs to identify appropriate financial solutions. 
Our business banking lending portfolio comprises of CRE and commercial non-real estate loans. CRE loans include both owner-occupied CRE and non-owner-occupied CRE loans, multifamily residential real estate loans and construction and development loans. CRE lending is a significant component of our overall loan portfolio, although we are focused on managing our exposure to land development loans within construction and development lending, in particular, which we believe is relatively riskier than other types of CRE lending, including owner-occupied CRE lending. Commercial non-real estate loans represent one of our core competencies in business banking. We offer a focused range of lending products to our commercial non-real estate customers, including working capital and other shorter-term lines of credit, fixed-rate loans over a wide range of terms and variable-rate loans with varying terms.

The compositions of our CRE and commercial non-real estate loan portfolios, aggregated by customer exposure as of September 30, 2017, are diversified across loan sizes, as set forth below: 

Agribusiness Banking 
In addition to business banking, we consider agribusiness lending one of our core competencies. We have been providing banking services to the agricultural community since our bank was founded. We have developed extensive expertise and brand recognition in agribusiness lending, which is one of the largest industries that we serve. We provide loans and banking services to agribusiness customers across our geographic footprint. We predominantly lend to grain and protein producers who produce a range of agricultural commodities. Our agribusiness customers range in size from small family farms to large commercial farming operations. At September 30, 2017, our agribusiness loan portfolio was $2.12 billion, representing 23.6% of our bank’s $8.97 billion in total lending. Our agribusiness loan portfolio was balanced at September 30, 2017, among the major types of agricultural production undertaken in our footprint, with grains (primarily corn, soybeans and wheat) representing 32.9% of our agribusiness loan portfolio; proteins (primarily beef cattle, dairy products and hogs) representing 51.8% of our agribusiness loan portfolio; and other products (including cotton, trees, fruits and nuts and vegetables, among others) representing 15.3% of our agribusiness loan portfolio, as set forth below:

1 Balances in this row represent acquired workout loans and certain other loans managed by our staff, fair value adjustments related to acquisitions and loans for which we have elected the fair value option, which could result in a negative carrying amount in the event of a net negative fair value adjustment.

We offer a number of products to meet our agribusiness customers’ banking needs, from short-term working capital funding to long-term land-related lending, as well as other tailored services. Through relationships with insurance agencies, we make available to our customers crop insurance that can provide farms with options for financial protection from various events, including flood, drought, hail, fire, disease, insect damage, wildfire and earthquake. We service our agribusiness customers through dedicated relationship bankers with deep industry/sector knowledge, supplemented by a team of local bankers focused on agriculture who build long-term relationships with customers. 
Retail Banking
Retail banking provides a source of low-cost funding and deposit-related fee income. At September 30, 2017, our branch network consisted of 173 branch offices located in 129 communities. Our branch network enhances our ability to gather deposits, expand our brand presence, service our customers’ needs, originate loans and maintain our customer relationships. 
 10

We offer traditional banking products to our retail customers, including non-interest-bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing savings and money market accounts, individual retirement accounts ("IRAs"), and time certificates of deposit. As the banking industry continues to experience broader customer acceptance of online and mobile banking tools for conducting basic banking functions and retail customers use branch locations with less frequency than they have historically, we serve our customers through a wide range of non-branch channels; including online, telephone and mobile banking platforms. In addition, we continue to optimize our branch network and have closed and/or relocated many less profitable branches. We continue to strive to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution channels and increase our operational efficiency to adapt to increasing customer preferences for self-service banking capabilities. At September 30, 2017, we had ATMs at 162, or 93.6%, of our branches and had another 21 company-owned ATMs at off-site locations. We are part of the MoneyPass, SHAZAM and NETS networks, enabling our customers to withdraw cash surcharge-free and service charge-free at over 25,000 ATM locations across the country. 
Our retail branch network is spread among our five regions as follows: 

 | September 30, 2017
 | Number of branches | % of branches
South Dakota | 38 | 22.0% 
Arizona and Colorado | 28 | 16.2% 
Iowa, Kansas and Missouri | 54 | 31.2% 
Nebraska | 50 | 28.9% 
North Dakota and Minnesota | 3 | 1.7% 
Total | 173 | 100.0% 

We also provide a variety of loan products to individuals. At September 30, 2017, our residential real estate and consumer portfolio was $1.00 billion, representing 11.0% of our total lending, and comprised residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit and general lines of credit, auto loans and other loans. We also have a small amount of consumer credit card balances outstanding. In addition to retail loans held in our portfolio, we also originate residential mortgage loans for resale (including their servicing) on the secondary market and, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we sold $280.5 million of these loans and serviced $722.5 million of mortgage loans. At September 30, 2017, we had a retail and mortgage loan officer base of 425 individuals. Home equity originations (including residential mortgages) are sourced almost exclusively through our branch network. Our home equity loan portfolio is conservatively underwritten, including assessment of the borrower’s income, FICO score and the loan-to-value ratio. See “—Loans—Underwriting Principles” for discussion of our credit underwriting standards. 
Wealth Management
We also provide our customers with a selection of wealth management solutions, including financial planning, private banking, investment management and trust services through associations with third party vendors, including registered broker-dealers and our investment adviser. Our investment representatives offer our customers investment management services through our branch network which entails overseeing and recommending investment allocations between asset classes based on a review of a client’s risk tolerance. These representatives also offer and sell insurance solutions, including life insurance, and offer trust services, including personal trusts and estate planning. At September 30, 2017 our investment representatives had $780.8 million in assets under management, and, through our trust services group, we had $1.00 billion in assets under management, for a combined total of $1.78 billion in assets under management. Enhancing and expanding our wealth management business is an important component of our strategic plan, as we believe it can deepen our customer relationships, create opportunities to provide a wider range of financial services products to our customers and drive stable and recurring revenue.

Loans
Overview 
Our loan portfolio consists primarily of CRE, commercial non-real estate and agribusiness loans. We also originate residential real estate loans, personal loans, home equity loans, lines of credit, credit cards and auto loans. As described below, our loan portfolio is diversified across our customer base.
The following chart sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio by loan category as of September 30, 2017: 
Our underwriting principles, discussed below, require portfolio diversification across geographies, industries and customers. Our lending is diversified both geographically, predominantly across our nine footprint states, and across our loan categories referenced above and within each of these categories. For example, within agribusiness lending, our portfolio is diversified across grain, protein and other types of agribusiness. Our commercial non-real estate and owner-occupied CRE lending categories are well diversified, with no individual industry comprising more than 10.0% of lending in these combined categories. See “—Our Business Lines—Agribusiness Banking” for information about the composition of our agribusiness loan portfolio and “—Our Business Lines—Business Banking” for information about the composition of our business banking loan portfolio. At a customer level, our largest exposure represents 0.7% of our total loans, and our top ten loan exposures represent approximately 4.9% of our total loans at September 30, 2017. 
Underwriting Principles
General. We apply consistent credit principles in our assessment of lending proposals across all loan categories. We are a cash flow-focused lender, which means our assessment of any potential loan includes an analysis of whether the customer can generate sufficient cash flow, not only in normal operating conditions but in a range of circumstances, to ensure the likelihood that the borrowers’ repayment obligations to our bank can be fully met. Our underwriting procedures include an assessment of the borrower’s cash flow sustainability, the acceptability of the borrowing purpose, the borrower’s liquidity, leverage, collateral quality and adequacy, industry dynamics, management capability, integrity and experience. For residential real estate, consumer and other lending, our underwriting process is intended to assess the prospective borrower’s credit standing and ability to repay (which we analyze based on the borrower’s cash flow, liquidity, credit standing, employment history and overall financial condition) and the value and adequacy of any collateral. 
 12

We establish what we believe to be conservative collateral guidelines that recognize the potential effects of volatility or deterioration of the value of collateral we accept, such as real estate, inventory, receivables and machinery. We manage this risk in a number of ways, including through advance rate guidelines for the various types of collateral we typically accept, along with periodic inspections. In addition, where we take real estate as collateral, and for some other specialized assets, we require assessment of value based on appropriate methodology and benchmarks. For our larger real estate commitments, this can include an independent third party appraisal review and, where appropriate, additional reviews. 
We also assess the presence and viability of one or more acceptable secondary sources of repayment to mitigate potential future borrower cash flow deterioration. To improve the reliability of secondary sources of repayment, we prefer originating loans on a secured basis, and at September 30, 2017, less than 1.0% of our total lending was on an unsecured basis. We typically engage in unsecured lending only in situations involving long-standing customers of sound net worth and above-average liquidity with strong repayment ability (other than in connection with credit cards we issue). 
We have a delegated commitment authorities framework that provides what we believe to be conservative levels of lending authority to our bankers commensurate with their role and lending experience. Commitments above the lending thresholds established for a banker require the approval, depending on the size of the commitment, of our regional credit managers, central senior credit managers, Chief Credit Officer or, for our largest commitments, our transactional credit committee. Loan analysis and decisions are documented and form part of the loan’s continual monitoring and relationship management record. We believe this framework provides the necessary separation of authority and independence in the credit underwriting process while providing flexibility to expedite appropriate credit decisions and provide competitive customer service. 
Agribusiness. The underwriting principles described above generally apply to our agribusiness lending, although our assessment of cash flow sustainability, acceptability of borrowing purpose, borrower liquidity, industry environment, marketing and management capability, integrity and experience are considered in light of the unique attributes of agribusiness lending. For example, we review the adequacy and sustainability of an agribusiness customer’s operating cash flows to determine adequate coverage of interest and scheduled principal repayments, and, generally, require a minimum of 1.10 times in the most recent year or based on a 3-year average. We work with the borrower to select the appropriate funding facility, such as working capital line funding for short-term needs, medium-term borrowing to fund purchases of durables like machinery or equipment and long-term real estate loans, which are typically committed for five to ten years, with a maximum of 15 years. 
As described above, we establish what we believe to be conservative collateral guidelines for our lending that recognize the volatility of asset prices. We also tailor the structure of certain loans, apply additional policies and require appropriate covenants to ensure our bank is well protected against the key potential risks. For livestock, we adopt what we believe to be conservative valuations to reduce the effects of cyclical trends before applying our collateral guidelines. For growing grain crops, we generally limit our lending to the coverage provided by crop insurance. 
As is the case with all types of lending, external risks beyond a customer’s business and operations can affect repayment. Our agribusiness lending, in particular, is subject to several external risks that we manage in various ways, including: 

• | Price cycles and volatility—Agricultural commodity prices are both cyclical and volatile, and we seek to manage these factors by diversifying our portfolio across a range of agribusiness customers including grain producers and protein producers (e.g., generally, low grain prices assist protein producers since their businesses use grains as inputs) and by determining and applying appropriate advance rate guidelines to agricultural commodities used as collateral, as discussed above.


• | Weather, disease and other perils—Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business and the business of our borrowers. We seek to mitigate our exposure to this risk through our geographic diversification which is predominantly across nine states and a number of agricultural products. Federally subsidized crop insurance coverage is also available for over 120 kinds of crops, typically of 50% to 85% of a grower’s average yield, against various agriculture-related perils, including flood, drought, hail, fire, disease, insect damage, wildlife and earthquake.


• | Land prices—As discussed above, we focus on cash flow lending, which helps farms to ensure that they have sufficient cash flow to service debt and support their businesses, and generally take land as collateral, which provides a secondary repayment source, with conservative advance rate guidelines in assessing collateral adequacy.

Deposits
Deposits are our primary source of funds to support our revenue-generating assets. We offer traditional deposit products to consumers, businesses and other customers with a variety of rates and terms. Deposits at our bank are insured by the FDIC up to statutory limits. We price our deposit products with a view to maximizing our share of each customer’s financial services business and prudently managing our cost of funds. At September 30, 2017, we held $8.98 billion of total deposits. At September 30, 2017, our deposit base consisted of $3.72 billion, or 41.5%, in checking accounts, $3.98 billion, or 44.3%, in money market and savings accounts, and $1.27 billion, or 14.2%, in time deposits and IRAs. 
Our deposit base is diversified across our geographic footprint, as illustrated by the following table showing the composition of our deposit base by the geographic region of our branches at September 30, 2017: 

 | September 30, 2017 
 | Number of Branches | Deposits | | % of Deposits
 | (dollars in thousands)
South Dakota | 38 | $ | 2,231,857 | | | 24.9% 
Arizona and Colorado | 28 | 1,530,668 | | | 17.0%
Iowa, Kansas and Missouri | 54 | 2,561,315 | | | 28.5%
Nebraska | 50 | 2,521,631 | | | 28.1%
North Dakota and Minnesota | 3 | 51,527 | | | 0.6% 
Corporate and other | — | 80,615 | | | 0.9% 
Total | 173 | $ | 8,977,613 | | | 100.0%

Our deposit base is also diversified by client type. As of September 30, 2017, no individual depositor represented more than 1.7% of our total deposits, and our top ten depositors represented 8.5% of our total deposits. The composition of our deposit portfolio represents our strategy to move away from more costly time deposit accounts over the last few years toward more cost-effective transaction accounts as well as our focus on gathering business deposits, which are typically transaction accounts by nature. This shift in deposit mix has been largely responsible for the recent declines in our average cost of deposits from 0.48% at September 30, 2013 to 0.40% at September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2017, our deposit base included $843.5 million of municipal deposits, against which we were required to hold $533.3 million of collateral. Municipal deposits represent approximately 652 customers with an average balance per customer of $1.3 million. 
The graph below shows our total deposits and deposits acquired at the end of each fiscal year presented, as well as weighted average costs of deposits for each fiscal year presented:

Risk Oversight and Management
We believe risk management is another core competency of our business. As we have grown, our risk team and its capabilities have expanded. Our risk management consists of comprehensive policies and processes and seeks to emphasize personal ownership and accountability for risk with all our employees. We expect our people to focus on managing our risks, and we support this with appropriate oversight and governance and a framework based on three lines of defense (including an internal audit team who report directly to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors). We delegate authority for our risk management oversight and governance to a number of executive management committees, each responsible for overseeing various aspects of our risk management process. Various board committees, including the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors, provide oversight over our risk management function. 
Our Management Risk Committee is responsible for oversight and governance of all risks across the enterprise. These responsibilities include monitoring our bank’s overall risk profile to ensure it remains within the Board-approved risk appetite and adjusting activities as appropriate, assessing new and emerging risks, monitoring our risk management culture, assessing acceptability of the risk impacts of any material changes (or additions) to our products, vendor relationships, partnerships or other processes and overseeing compliance with regulatory expectations and requirements. The Management Risk Committee is chaired by our President and Chief Executive Officer and includes our Chief Risk Officer, Chief Credit Officer and executives representing our business and support areas together with senior risk managers. The Management Risk Committee is supported by the following five subcommittees, each with specific responsibility to monitor, oversee and approve changes in their respective areas of focus relating to risks: Asset & Liability Committee, Operational Risk & Compliance Committee, Transactional Credit Committee, Risk Standards Review Panel and Technology Committee. Our Transactional Credit Committee reviews and approves our largest lending exposures. 
Our Chief Risk Officer leads our integrated risk management function that provides second line oversight of all enterprise risk, including strategic risk, credit risk and operational risk (such as compliance, regulatory, legal and reputational risk), as well as overseeing ongoing enhancements to our risk management processes. Our Chief Risk Officer, a member of our executive leadership team, reports to our President and Chief Executive Officer and has direct access to the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, our executive leadership team and other members of management have responsibility for oversight and management of risk across business and operational lines. 
Risk Framework and Appetite
Our risk framework is structured to guide decisions regarding the appropriate balance between risk and return considerations in our business. Our risk framework is informed by our strategy, risk appetite and financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. This framework includes risk policies, procedures, limits, targets and reporting. Our Board of Directors approves our stated risk appetites, which set forth the amount and type of risk we are willing to accept in pursuit of our strategy, business and financial objectives. Our risk appetites provide the context for our risk management tools, including, among others, risk policies, delegated authorities, limits, portfolio composition, underwriting standards and operational processes. 
We manage risk through three lines of defense that allocate responsibility and accountability for risk management throughout our business. Our first line of defense is our business lines, credit and support functions, which are accountable for being aware of and managing the risks in their respective business areas and for operating within our established risk framework and appetite. Our second line of defense is our risk team, which provides monitoring, control, oversight and advice on risk to our business lines, credit and support functions across the enterprise, and our third line of defense is our internal audit function, which provides independent oversight that risks are being managed to an acceptable level and that our internal control frameworks are operating effectively. 
Credit Risk Management
Credit risk is the potential for loss arising from a customer, counterparty or issuer failing to meet its contractual obligations to us. Our strategy for managing credit risk includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, clearly delegated authority levels and accountability, ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for credit exposures and portfolio diversification by geography, industry and customer. We segment our loan portfolio into a number of asset classes for purposes of developing and documenting our credit risk management procedures and determining associated allowance for loan and lease losses, including CRE, agriculture, commercial non-real estate, real estate, consumer and other lending. For a discussion of our underwriting standards, see “—Loans—Underwriting Principles.” 
 15

We emphasize regular credit examinations and management reviews of loans with deteriorating credit quality as part of our credit risk management strategy. As part of this process, we perform assessments of asset quality, compliance with commercial and consumer credit policies and other critical credit information. We also monitor and update risk ratings on our non-consumer loans on an ongoing basis. With respect to consumer loans, we typically use standard credit scoring systems to assess our credit risks. We also rely on a dedicated risk asset review team to provide independent assurance of portfolio asset quality and policy compliance. 
We have well-established procedures for managing loans that either show early signs of weakness or appear to have actually weakened. These procedures include moving a loan to our “watch” list when we have early concerns. Loans on our watch list receive more intense focus, along with more senior-level monitoring and reporting, a requirement of higher credit authority approval for any further lending increase and action plans for improving the prospects for such loans. Loans that we rate “substandard” (or lower) that are over $250,000 will generally fall under the management or consultation of our strategic business services team ("SBS"), our specialist loan rehabilitations, workout and other real estate owned ("OREO") asset team. These loans are actively managed, with the primary goal of SBS rehabilitating the loans to “performing” status. If rehabilitation is not feasible, a loan workout strategy is developed and put into execution to maximize our bank’s recovery of loan proceeds and other costs to which the bank is legally entitled. SBS also oversees the litigation of troubled assets, when appropriate. In addition, appropriate reserves and charge-offs are made based on assessment of potential realization levels and related costs. 
Our non-lending activities also give rise to credit risk, including exposures resulting from our investment in securities and our entry into interest rate swap contracts. For more information on these activities, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Analysis of Financial Condition—Investments” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Analysis of Financial Condition—Derivatives.” 
Operational Risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes, people or systems, external events (such as natural disasters), compliance failures, reputational damage or legal matters. We have a framework in place that includes the reporting and assessment of any operational risk events, including narrowly avoided operational risk events, and the assessment of our mitigating strategies within our key business lines. This framework is implemented through our policies, processes and reporting requirements, including those governing business and information technology continuity, information security and cyber-security, technological capability, fraud-risk management, operational risk profiling and vendor management. Our operational risk review process is a core part of our assessment of any material new or modified business or support initiative. 
Our operational risks related to legal and compliance matters are heightened by the heavily regulated environment in which we operate. We have designed our processes and systems, and provide education of applicable legal and regulatory standards to our employees, to comply with these requirements. For information on the legal framework in which we operate, and which our operational risk processes and systems are designed to address, see “—Supervision and Regulation.” 
Competition
The financial services industry and each of the markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive. We face strong competition in gathering deposits, making loans and obtaining client assets for management by our investment or trust operations. We compete for deposits and loans by seeking to provide a higher level of personal service than is generally offered by our larger competitors, many of whom have more assets, capital and resources and higher lending limits than we do and may be able to conduct more intensive and broader based promotional efforts to reach both commercial and retail customers. We also compete based on advertising impact and interest rates. Our principal competitors for deposits, loans and client assets for management by our investment or trust operations include large nationwide banks such as U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo and Bank of America and various other nationwide, regional and community banks operating in our markets. 
Competition for deposits is also affected by the ease with which customers can transfer deposits from one institution to another. Our cost of funds fluctuates with market interest rates and may be affected by higher rates being offered by other financial institutions. In certain interest rate environments, additional significant competition for deposits may be expected to arise from corporate and government debt securities and money market mutual funds. Our management believes that our most direct competition for deposits comes from nationwide and regional banks, savings banks and associations, online internet banks, credit unions, insurance companies, money market funds, brokerage firms, other non-bank financial services companies and service-focused community banks that target the same customers. 
 16

Finally, deposit acquisition and retention is affected by the customer's online and mobile banking experience. During fiscal year 2017, we launched an online account opening platform and an account-to-account transfer program for consumer customers. We believe these enhancements are more competitive product offerings and expect them to contribute to growth in deposit balances over time. 
We compete for loans principally through the quality of service we provide to borrowers while maintaining competitive interest rates, loan fees and other loan terms. We emphasize personalized relationship banking services and the local and efficient decision-making of our banking businesses. Because of economies of scale, our larger, nationwide competitors may offer loan pricing that is more attractive than loan pricing we can offer. Our most direct competition for loans comes from larger regional and national banks, savings banks and associations, online internet banks, credit unions, insurance companies and service-focused community banks that target the same customers. We also face competition for agribusiness loans from participants in the nationwide Farm Credit System and global banks. 
We compete for wealth management clients on the basis of the level of investment performance, fees and personalized client service. Our competition in wealth management services comes primarily from other institutions, particularly larger regional and national banks, providing similar services, wealth management companies and brokerage firms, many of which are larger than us and provide a wider array of products and services. 
Intellectual Property 
In the highly competitive banking industry in which we operate, intellectual property is important to the success of our business. We own a variety of trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos and spend time and resources maintaining this intellectual property portfolio. We control access to our intellectual property through license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property. 
Information Technology Systems
We devote significant resources to maintain stable, reliable, efficient and scalable information technology systems. We utilize a single, highly integrated core processing system from a third party vendor across our business that improves cost efficiency and acquisition integration. As advantageous, we work with our third party vendors to maximize the efficiency of our use of their applications. We use integrated systems to originate and process loans and deposit accounts, which reduces processing time, improves customer experience and reduces costs. Most customer records are maintained digitally. During fiscal year 2017, we have successfully executed several initiatives to continue to enhance our information security, online, mobile and cash management banking services and have implemented a new more automated branch teller transaction processing system to further improve the overall client experience. 
Protecting our systems to ensure the safety of our customers’ information is critical to our business. We use multiple layers of protection to control access and reduce risk, including conducting a variety of vulnerability and penetration tests on our platforms, systems and applications to reduce the risk that any attacks are successful. To protect against disasters, we have a backup offsite core processing system and recovery plans. 
We have an enterprise data warehouse system to capture, analyze and report key metrics associated with customer and product profitability. Data that previously was arduous to collect across multiple systems is now available daily through standard and ad hoc reports to assist with managing our business and competing effectively in the marketplace. 
Employees
As of September 30, 2017, we had 1,689 total employees, which included 1,542 full-time employees, 145 part-time employees and 2 temporary employees. Of our 1,689 employees, 1,204 are in core banking (i.e., non-line of business branch network employees, including relationship bankers), 90 employees are in lines of business (e.g., mortgage, credit cards, investments), 34 employees are in finance, 210 employees are in support services (i.e., employees in operations, IT and projects), 96 employees are in risk and credit management, 13 employees are in internal audit and 42 employees are in other functions. We believe our relationship with our employees to be generally good. We have not experienced any material employment-related issues or interruptions of services due to labor disagreements and are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.

Supervision and Regulation
We and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state banking laws that establish a comprehensive framework for our operations. This framework may materially impact our growth potential and financial performance and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of our stockholders and creditors. Significant elements of the statutes, regulations and policies applicable to us and our subsidiaries are described below. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies described. 
Regulatory Agencies
Great Western is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act or the "BHC Act". Consequently, Great Western and its subsidiaries are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve. The BHC Act provides generally for “umbrella” regulation of bank holding companies and functional regulation of holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory agencies. Great Western is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Exchange Act administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and, following the listing of our common stock, the rules adopted by the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, applicable to listed companies.
Great Western Bank, our bank subsidiary, is an FDIC-insured commercial bank chartered under the laws of South Dakota. Our bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. Consequently, the FDIC and the Division of Banking of the South Dakota Department of Labor and Regulation, or the South Dakota Division of Banking, are the primary regulators of our bank and also regulate our bank’s subsidiaries. Our bank is also subject to the enforcement and rule-making authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, regarding consumer financial products. The CFPB has authority to create and enforce consumer protection rules and regulations and has the power to examine our bank for compliance with such rules and regulations. The CFPB also has the authority to prohibit "unfair, deceptive or abusive" acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, such as our bank. In addition, we offer certain insurance and investment products through our bank and our bank’s subsidiaries that are subject to regulation and supervision by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies and by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, as a result of a contractual relationship we have with a third party broker-dealer relating to the provision of some wealth management and investment services to customers. 
 19

Permissible Activities for Bank Holding Companies
In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. 
Bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be treated as “financial holding companies” may engage in a broad range of additional activities that are (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activities or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. These activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. We have not elected to be treated as a financial holding company and currently have no plans to make a financial holding company election. 
The BHC Act does not place territorial restrictions on permissible non-banking activities of bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuing such activity, ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. 
Permissible Activities for Banks
As a South Dakota-chartered commercial bank, our bank’s business is generally limited to activities permitted by South Dakota law and any applicable federal laws. Under the South Dakota Banking Code, our bank may generally engage in all usual banking activities, including taking commercial and savings deposits; lending money on personal and real security; issuing letters of credit; buying, discounting, and negotiating promissory notes, bonds, drafts and other forms of indebtedness; buying and selling currency and, subject to certain limitations, certain investment securities; engaging in all facets of the insurance business; and maintaining safe deposit boxes on premises. Subject to prior approval by the Director of the South Dakota Division of Banking, our bank may also permissibly engage in any activity permissible as of January 1, 2008 for a national bank doing business in South Dakota. 
South Dakota law also imposes restrictions on our bank’s activities and corporate governance requirements intended to ensure the safety and soundness of our bank. For example, South Dakota law requires our bank’s officers to be elected annually and the election of each officer to be confirmed by the Director of the South Dakota Division of Banking. Our bank is also restricted under South Dakota law from investing in certain types of investment securities and is generally limited in the amount of money it can lend to a single borrower or invest in securities issued by a single issuer (in each case, 20% of our bank’s capital stock and surplus plus 10% of our bank’s undivided profits). 
Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies
The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, the South Dakota Banking Code and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks and other FDIC-insured depository institutions. We must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of any FDIC-insured depository institution or other bank holding company (other than directly through our bank), (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FDIC is required for our bank to merge with another bank or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or assume any of the deposits of another FDIC-insured depository institution. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, bank regulators consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position and managerial resources of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, or the CRA, the applicant’s compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of all organizations involved in combating money laundering activities. In addition, failure to implement or maintain adequate compliance programs could cause bank regulators not to approve an acquisition where regulatory approval is required or to prohibit an acquisition even if approval is not required. 
Dividends; Stress Testing
Great Western is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. As a bank holding company, Great Western is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to pay dividends under applicable banking laws and regulations. Federal bank regulators are authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. In particular, federal 
 20

bank regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete a banking organization’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, in the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 
A significant portion of our income comes from dividends from our bank, which is also the primary source of our liquidity. In addition to the restrictions discussed above, our bank is subject to limitations under South Dakota law regarding the level of dividends that it may pay to us. In general, dividends by our bank may only be declared from its net profits and may be declared no more than once per calendar quarter. The approval of the South Dakota Director of Banking is required if our bank seeks to pay aggregate dividends during any calendar year that would exceed the sum of its net profits from the year to date and retained net profits from the preceding two years, minus any required transfers to surplus. 
In October 2012, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC published final rules regarding company-run stress testing. These rules require bank holding companies and banks that meet the definition of a "covered bank" to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital, consolidated earnings and losses under one base and at least two stress scenarios provided by the federal bank regulators. A "covered bank" is a bank holding company or a bank which has an average of consolidated assets over the four most recent consecutive quarters greater than $10 billion. We became a "covered bank" as of June 30, 2016 and as such we will report our first stress test under the 2018 year stress test cycle. We have an ongoing project to ensure that we are able to meet these requirements in a timely fashion and have completed an internal dry run of the stress test cycle during 2017 to increase preparedness for our 2018 submission. Neither we nor our bank is currently subject to the stress testing requirements, but we expect that once we are subject to those requirements, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the South Dakota Division of Banking will consider our results as an important factor in evaluating our capital adequacy, and that of our bank, in evaluating any proposed acquisitions and in determining whether any proposed dividends or stock repurchases by us or by our bank may be an unsafe or unsound practice. 
Transactions with Affiliates
Transactions between our bank and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Great Western or any other subsidiary, on the other hand, are regulated under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative and qualitative requirements and collateral requirements on covered transactions by Great Western Bank with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B limit the extent to which our bank or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of our bank's capital stock and surplus, and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus, and requires those transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to our bank as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third party. Covered transactions are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve) from the affiliate, certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In addition, any credit transactions with an affiliate must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral. 
Federal law also limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% (or greater) stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of non-repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate. 
Source of Strength
Federal Reserve policy and federal law require bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Under this requirement, we are expected to commit resources to support our bank, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources, and it may not be in our, or our stockholders’ or creditors’, best interests to do so. In addition, any capital loans we make to our bank are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of our bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of our bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 
 21

Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Federal Reserve monitors the capital adequacy of our holding company on a consolidated basis, and the FDIC and the South Dakota Division of Banking monitor the capital adequacy of our bank. The bank regulators use a combination of risk-based guidelines and a leverage ratio to evaluate capital adequacy. The risk-based capital guidelines applicable to us and our bank are based on the Basel Committee’s December 2010 final capital framework, known as Basel III, as implemented by the federal bank regulators. The risk-based guidelines are intended to make regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in credit and market risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to weighted risk categories, and capital is classified in one of the following tiers depending on its characteristic:
Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") Capital CET1 capital for us includes common equity, surplus and retained earnings less goodwill, most intangible assets and certain other assets. The capital rules require bank holding companies and banks to include Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI") into CET1 unless the bank and bank holding company use a one-time election to exclude AOCI from its regulatory capital metrics on January 1st, 2015. We elected to exclude AOCI from CET1.
Tier 1 (Core) Capital-Tier 1 capital for us includes CET1 and qualifying trust preferred securities at the holding company level, less goodwill, most intangible assets and certain other assets. 
Tier 2 (Supplementary) Capital-Tier 2 capital for us includes qualifying subordinated debt and a limited amount of allowance for loan and lease losses. 
Bank holding companies and banks are also currently required to comply with minimum leverage requirements, measured based on the ratio of a bank holding company’s or a bank’s, as applicable, Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average total assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). These requirements generally necessitate a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all bank holding companies and banks. To be considered “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, our bank must maintain minimum Tier 1 leverage ratios of at least 5%. See “—Prompt Corrective Action Framework.” 
Basel III and the Capital Rules.  In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved final rules, or the Capital Rules, implementing the Basel Committee’s December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks, including us and our bank, compared to the previous risk-based capital rules. The Capital Rules revise the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in regulatory capital ratio calculations. The Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in regulatory capital ratio calculations, including replacing the existing risk-weighting approach derived from Basel I with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach adopted by the Basel Committee in its 2004 capital accords, known as Basel II. The Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal bank regulators’ rules. Subject to a phase-in period for various provisions, the Capital Rules became effective for us and for our bank beginning on January 1, 2015. 
Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are (i) 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 6% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets and (iii) 8% total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets. 
The current capital rules also include a capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. In addition, the Capital Rules provide for a countercyclical capital buffer applicable only to certain covered institutions. We do not expect the countercyclical capital buffer to be applicable to us or our bank. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 
The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased in over a three-year period (increasing by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). When fully phased-in, the Capital Rules will require us, and our bank, to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) 7% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and (iii) 10.5% total capital to risk-weighted assets.

The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The Capital Rules also generally preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, from being counted as Tier 1 capital for most bank holding companies. Bank holding companies such as us who had less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009 (and who continue to have less than $15 billion in assets) are permitted to include trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 as Additional Tier 1 capital under the Capital Rules, however. 
The Capital Rules also prescribed a new standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0%, for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600%, for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. 
With respect to our bank, the Capital Rules also revised the prompt corrective action regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or the FDIA. See “—Prompt Corrective Action Framework.” 
We believe that, as of September 30, 2017, we and our bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements were then in effect. 
Liquidity Requirements
Historically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III final framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio, or NSFR, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements will incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. 
In September 2015, the federal bank regulators approved final rules implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approach banking organizations, neither of which would apply to us or our bank. The federal bank regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR, but the Federal Reserve has stated its intent to adopt a version of this measure as well. 
Prompt Corrective Action Framework
The FDIA requires the federal bank regulators to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that fail to meet specified capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories (“well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized”), and the federal bank regulators are required to take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. The severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDIA requires the regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. 
An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 
 23

The Capital Rules revised the current prompt corrective action requirements effective January 1, 2015 by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the previous 6%); and (iii) eliminating the provision that provided that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The Capital Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category. 
As of September 30, 2017, we and our bank were well capitalized with Tier 1 capital ratios of 11.4% and 11.6%, respectively, total capital ratios of 12.5% and 12.2%, respectively, Tier 1 leverage ratios of 10.3% and 10.4%, respectively, and a CET1 ratio of 10.7% and 11.6%, respectively, as calculated under Basel III which went into effect on January 1, 2015. For more information on these financial measures, including reconciliations to our and our bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital.” 
An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal bank regulator. Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The obligation of a controlling bank holding company under the FDIA to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions and capital distributions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC. Institutions that are undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions failing to submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator. 
In addition, the FDIA prohibits an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is well capitalized or is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A depository institution that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. 
Safety and Soundness Standards
The federal banking agencies have adopted the Interagency Guidelines for Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. These guidelines also prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the bank regulator must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution may be subject under the FDIA. See “—Prompt Corrective Action Framework.” If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the bank regulator may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. 
 24

Deposit Insurance
FDIC Insurance Assessments. As an FDIC-insured bank, our bank must pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC based on its average total assets minus its average tangible equity. Our bank’s assessment rates are currently based on its risk classification (i.e., the level of risk it poses to the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund). Institutions classified as higher risk pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk. With the acquisition of HF Financial in 2016, our total assets exceeded $10 billion as of the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Since our bank's total consolidated assets have exceeded $10 billion for four consecutive quarters, the FDIC uses a performance score and a loss-severity score to calculate the assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses a bank’s capital level and regulatory supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC also has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations. In addition to ordinary assessments described above, the FDIC has the ability to impose special assessments in certain instances. 
The FDIC’s deposit insurance fund is currently underfunded, and the FDIC has raised assessment rates and imposed special assessments on certain institutions during recent years to raise funds. In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. In March of 2016, the FDIC approved a final rule to meet this requirement by 2018. To meet the minimum reserve ratio by 2018, during the third calendar quarter of 2016 the FDIC began assessing banks with consolidated assets of more than $10 billion a surcharge assessment of 0.045%. The surcharge will continue through the earlier of the quarter that the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35% and December 30, 2018.
Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 
Other Assessments. In addition, the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 authorized the Financing Corporation to impose assessments on deposit insurance fund applicable deposits in order to service the interest on the Financing Corporation’s bond obligations from deposit insurance fund assessments. The amount assessed on individual institutions is in addition to the amount, if any, paid for deposit insurance according to the FDIC’s risk-related assessment rate schedules. Assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment base. 
Heightened Requirements for Bank Holding Companies with $10 Billion or More in Assets
Various federal banking laws and regulations, including rules adopted by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, impose heightened requirements on certain large banks and bank holding companies. Most of these rules apply primarily to bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, but certain rules also apply to banks and bank holding companies with at least $10 billion in total consolidated assets. With the acquisition of HF Financial on May 16, 2016, our total consolidated assets exceeded $10 billion. As the average of our total consolidated assets over the four most recent quarters exceeds $10 billion we are required to perform annual stress tests as described above in "—Dividends; Stress Testing" and below in "—Capital and Stress Testing Requirements". Because our bank’s total consolidated assets equal or exceed $10 billion, we or our bank, as applicable, will, among other requirements: 

• | be required to have a dedicated risk committee of our Board of Directors responsible for overseeing our enterprise-wide risk management policies, which must be commensurate with our capital structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors, and including as a member at least one risk management expert;


• | calculate our FDIC deposit assessment base using the performance score and a loss-severity score system described above in “—Deposit Insurance;” and


• | be examined for compliance with federal consumer protection laws primarily by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, as described below in “—Consumer Financial Protection.”

Prior to exceeding $10 billion in total consolidated assets, we began analyzing these rules to ensure we were prepared to comply with these rules as applicable. We have established a Board Risk Committee and are running periodic and selective stress tests on liquidity, interest rates and certain areas of our loan portfolio. 
 25

The Volcker Rule
The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances, and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of three percent (3%) of Tier 1 Capital in private equity and hedge funds (known as the "Volcker Rule"). In December 2013, federal regulators adopted final rules to implement the Volcker Rule. The Final Rules prohibit banking entities from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds, which are referred to as "covered funds". The Final Rules are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions. The Final Rules also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Although the Final Rules provide some tiering of compliance and reporting obligations based on size, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including the Great Western and our bank. Although the Final Rules were effective April 1, 2014, the Federal Reserve issued an order extending the period that institutions have to conform their activities to the requirements of the Volcker Rule to July 21, 2015. In addition, the Federal Reserve granted an extension until July 21, 2016 of the conformance period for banking entities to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013, and announced its intention to further extend this aspect of the conformance period until July 21, 2017. Great Western has evaluated the implications of the Final Rules on its investments and does not expect any material financial implications. 
Depositor Preference
Under federal law, depositors (including the FDIC with respect to the subrogated claims of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver. 
Interstate Branching
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, national and state-chartered banks, such as our bank, may open an initial branch in a state other than its home state (e.g., a host state) by establishing a de novo branch at any location in such host state at which a bank chartered in such host state could establish a branch. Applications to establish such branches must still be filed with the appropriate primary federal regulator and, where applicable, the bank's state regulatory authority. As our bank is a South Dakota state chartered bank, we are required to file branch applications with both the FDIC and the South Dakota Division of Banking.
Capital and Stress Testing Requirements
Capital Requirements
We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements both at the Company and at the Bank level administered by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, respectively. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (described below), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to judgments by the regulators regarding qualitative components, risk weightings, and other factors. We have consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios at or above the well capitalized standards. 
In July 2013, the Federal regulators issued final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. These rules implemented certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and a separate international framework established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision for the regulation of capital and liquidity, generally referred to as "Basel III". The final rules seek to strengthen the components of regulatory capital, increase risk-based capital requirements, and make selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The final rules, among other things:

• | revise minimum capital requirements and adjust prompt corrective action thresholds;


• | revise the components of regulatory capital and create a new capital measure called "Common Equity Tier 1", which must constitute at least 4.5% of risk-weighted assets;

 26


• | specify that Tier 1 capital consists only of Common Equity Tier 1 and certain "Additional Tier 1 Capital" instruments meetings specified requirements;


• | apply most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures to Common Equity Tier 1 and not to other components of capital, potentially requiring higher levels of Common Equity Tier 1 in order to meet minimum ratio requirements;


• | increase the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirements from 4% to 6%;


• | retain the existing risk-based capital treatment for 1-4 family residential mortgage exposures;


• | permit most banking organizations, including Great Western, to retain, through a one-time permanent election, the existing capital treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income;


• | implement a new capital conservation buffer of Common Equity Tier 1 capital equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which will be in addition to the 4.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and be phased in over a three year period beginning January 1, 2016 (this buffer is generally required to make capital distributions and pay executive bonuses);


• | increase capital requirements for past-due loans, high volatility commercial real estate exposures, and certain short-term loan commitments;


• | require the deduction of mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that exceed 10% of Common Equity Tier 1 capital in each category and 15% of Common Equity Tier 1 capital in the aggregate; and


• | remove references to credit ratings consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act and establish due diligence requirements for securitization exposures.

The Basel III Rules also require FDIC-insured state non-member banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion ("covered institutions") to establish a "capital conservation buffer" (consisting entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital) that will be 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements when it is fully phased in. The result will be an increase in the minimum common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratios to 7.0%, 8.5%, and 10.5%, respectively. 
The new capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution can be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital levels fall below these amounts. The Basel III Rules also establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such capital distributions.
The Basel III Rules also eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. In addition, certain deferred tax assets, and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock, will be required to be deducted from capital, subject to a two-year transition period. Finally, Tier 1 capital will include accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity securities. 
Under the final rules, compliance was required beginning January 1, 2015 for most banking organizations, including Great Western Bank, subject to a transition period for several aspects of the final rules, including the new minimum capital ratio requirements, the capital conservation buffer, and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions. Requirements to maintain higher levels of capital could adversely impact our return on equity. We believe we will continue to exceed all estimated well-capitalized regulatory requirements under these new rules on a fully phased-in basis. For further detail on capital and capital ratios see discussion under Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," sections "Liquidity" and "Capital".
 27

Capital Planning and Stress Testing Requirements
On October 12, 2012, the federal bank regulatory agencies published final rules implementing the company-run stress test requirements mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act for U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $10 billion to $50 billion. Under the rules, we will be required to conduct annual company-run stress tests using different scenarios (baseline, adverse and severely adverse) provided annually by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The stress test is designed to assess the potential impact of different scenarios on earnings, losses and capital over a set time period, with consideration given to certain factors, including the organization's condition, risks, exposures, strategies and activities. The banking agencies have issued guidance on stress testing for banking organizations with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. This guidance outlines four "high-level" principles for stress testing practices that regulators expect banking organizations to include in their stress testing framework. In particular, the stress testing framework should (i) include activities and exercises that are tailored to and sufficiently capture the banking organization's exposures, activities and risks, (ii) employ multiple conceptually sound stress testing activities and approaches, (iii) be forward-looking and flexible, and (iv) be clear, actionable, well-supported, and used in the decision-making process.
Banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $10 billion to $50 billion will be required to report the results of the stress test by July 31 of each year, using data as of December 31 of the preceding year, and subsequently publish a summary of the results between October 15 and October 31. We anticipate that our pro forma capital ratios, as reflected in the stress test calculations under the required stress test scenarios, will be an important factor considered by the Federal Reserve in evaluating whether proposed payments of dividends or stock repurchases are consistent with its prudential adverse scenarios could adversely impact our net income and our return on equity. 
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action
Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take "prompt corrective action" with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For such purposes, the law establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. 
As a result of the Basel III Rules, new definitions of the relevant measures for the five capital categories took effect on January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed is deemed to be "well capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, and a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreements, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 
An institution is deemed to be "adequately capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and generally a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater. 
An institution is deemed to be "undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, or generally a leverage capital ratio of less than 4%. An institution is deemed to be "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, or a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%. An institution is deemed to be "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.
"Undercapitalized" institutions are subject to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. An institution's compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the bank's total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is "significantly undercapitalized". Significantly undercapitalized institutions are subject to one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized; requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, or dismiss directors or officers; and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the parent holding company.
 28

Beginning 60 days after becoming "critically undercapitalized", critically undercapitalized institutions also may not make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt, extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction, or enter into any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business. In addition, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver is required for a critically undercapitalized institution within 270 days after it obtains such status.
Interchange Fees
Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. 
Interchange fees, or “swipe” fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Under the final rules, the maximum permissible interchange fee is equal to no more than 21 cents plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. The Federal Reserve also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover 1 cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. 
As we exceeded $10 billion in assets during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, effective July 1, 2017 we became subject to the interchange fee cap, and no longer qualify for the small issuer exemption. The small issuer exemption applies to any debit card issuer that, together with its affiliates, has total assets of less than $10 billion as of the end of the previous calendar year.
Consumer Financial Protection
We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act, CAN-SPAM Act, and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict our ability to raise interest rates and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required. 
The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), which was granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB is also authorized to engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. Although all institutions are subject to rules adopted by the CFPB and examination by the CFPB in conjunction with examinations by the institution’s primary federal regulator, the CFPB has primary examination and enforcement authority over institutions with assets of $10 billion or more. Our consolidated assets exceeded $10 billion in the third quarter of 2016 and we are now subject to CFPB examination of our bank and enforcement with respect to various federal consumer protection laws, as well as continued examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on certain consumer regulations. State authorities are also responsible for monitoring our compliance with all state consumer laws. 
The consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the examination, supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing regulations by the CFPB have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks including, among other things, the authority to prohibit "unfair, deceptive, or 
 29

abusive" acts and practices. The review of products and practices to prevent such acts and practices is a continuing focus of the CFPB, and of banking regulators more broadly. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional remediation efforts and possible penalties. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. The CFPB also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief or monetary penalties. The Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977
Under the CRA, our bank has an obligation, consistent with safe and sound operations, to help meet the credit needs of the market areas where it operates, which includes providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. In connection with its examination of our bank, the FDIC is required to assess our bank’s compliance with the CRA. Our bank’s failure to comply with the CRA could, among other things, result in the denial or delay in certain corporate applications filed by us or our bank, including applications for branch openings or relocations and applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or holding company. Our bank received an overall rating of “satisfactory” in its most recently completed CRA examination. 
Financial Privacy
The federal bank regulators have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. 
Anti-Money Laundering and the USA PATRIOT ACT
A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA Patriot Act, substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States in these areas: customer identification programs, money laundering, terrorist financing, identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions, currency crimes, and cooperation between financial institutions and law enforcement authorities. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Agency, among other federal agencies, also promulgates rules and regulations regarding the USA Patriot Act that Financial Institutions are required to comply. Financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations. 
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. We and our bank are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.

Incentive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulators and the SEC to maintain guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, including us and our bank, having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity.
The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as us, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 
Future Legislation and Regulation
Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which we operate and may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and modify our business strategy, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects may be adversely affected, perhaps materially, as a result.
