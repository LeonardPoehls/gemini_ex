Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical stage immunotherapy company dedicated to transforming the treatment of cancer by developing therapies that enable the immune system to attack tumors and provide long-lasting benefits to patients. We have developed a suite of integrated technologies that comprise our Translational Science Platform, enabling us to comprehensively interrogate the cellular and molecular composition of tumors. By focusing on specific cell types, both immune and non-immune, within tumors, we can prioritize targets and then identify related biomarkers designed to match the right therapy to the right patient. Through this deep, scientific understanding of the tumor microenvironment, or TME, our goal is to effectively and efficiently identify and develop new cancer immunotherapies designed to benefit patients with tumors across the spectrum from highly inflamed, or “hot,” to poorly inflamed, or “cold,” and especially those not well served by current therapies.
Our most advanced product candidate, JTX-2011, is a clinical-stage monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates the Inducible T cell CO-Stimulator, or ICOS, a protein on the surface of certain T cells commonly found in many solid tumors. JTX-2011 is being assessed in an adaptive Phase I/II clinical trial as both a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, including anti-PD-1 antibodies, to determine whether it can offer a treatment alternative to patients who otherwise lack an effective response to currently approved therapies, and/or whether it can enhance the therapeutic benefit of currently approved therapies. We expect to report preliminary efficacy data from our Phase I/II clinical trial of JTX-2011 in some solid tumors in the second quarter of 2018. Our second development candidate, JTX-4014, is an anti-PD-1 antibody that we are developing for use in combination with potential future product candidates, as we believe that combination therapy has the potential to be a mainstay of cancer immunotherapy. We expect to file an Investigational New Drug, or IND, for JTX-4014 in 2018. In addition, the next development candidate emerging from our Translational Science Platform efforts that focused on tumor-associated macrophages has entered IND enabling activities. Therapies targeting these innate immune cells may have the potential to complement the existing approaches that focus on T cells thereby providing benefit to patients with less-inflamed or colder tumors. 
The strategy for all of our product candidates involves a biomarker-driven, adaptive approach to the initial trial design. Early in the development process, we use our Translational Science Platform to identify potential predictive biomarkers to enable us to enrich our trials for a patient population that may be more likely to respond to our immunotherapy. In addition, we can also use characteristics defined by our biomarker efforts to focus on niche indications and/or niche subsets within indications to inform our clinical strategy. By taking this biomarker-driven approach, we believe that we can more efficiently develop cancer immunotherapies and potentially provide greater benefit to patients. We believe that the biomarker results, coordinated to clinical response, will determine the utility of proceeding to the use of a complementary diagnostic and/or companion diagnostic for a given therapy.
Our ability to prioritize targets and potential predictive biomarkers using our Translational Science Platform helped lead to our strategic collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene. This global strategic collaboration, which included a $225.0 million upfront payment and a $36.1 million equity investment, is primarily focused on co-developing and co-commercializing innovative biologic immunotherapy treatments for patients with cancer. Under the agreement, we granted Celgene exclusive options to develop and commercialize our lead product candidate, JTX-2011, and up to four early-stage programs consisting of targets to be selected from a pool of certain B cell, T regulatory cell and tumor-associated macrophage targets. Additionally, Celgene has an exclusive option to develop and commercialize our product candidate JTX-4014, which, upon exercise of such option, will be a shared program that may be used by both parties within and outside of the collaboration. Under the terms of the agreement, if Celgene exercises all of its options, all programs meet all milestones, including regulatory approvals in the United States and outside the United States, and Celgene extends the initial four-year research term for three additional years, we are eligible to earn up to approximately $2.6 billion in clinical, regulatory, and/or commercialization milestone payments, option-exercise fees and research term extension fees. In addition to progressing collaboration programs, we will continue to use our Translational Science Platform to progress our own programs that are not part of the collaboration and for which we retain worldwide commercial rights.
We have assembled a highly experienced team of experts in immunotherapy to help us leverage our Translational Science Platform to drive the development of our early discovery programs and our product candidates including JTX-2011. In addition, two of our founders, Dr. James Allison and Dr. Padmanee Sharma of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, were initially responsible for the translational science behind ICOS. Dr. James Allison played a fundamental role in ushering in the era of checkpoint therapy in general, including contributing to the 
3

understanding of the basic science of CTLA-4 that supported the development of ipilimumab, or Yervoy, a single agent immunotherapy that targets CTLA-4 on certain T cells.
Our Strategy
We aim to build a multi-product company that discovers, develops and commercializes first-in-class and/or best in class novel therapeutics and combination approaches that create options for patients who are less likely to respond to currently approved therapies and/or enhance responses in patients who may have had limited responses to currently approved immunotherapies. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Aggressively develop our product candidates, and subsequent candidates, using biomarker-driven adaptive trial designs aimed at bringing the right immunotherapy to the right patients;


• | Continue our investment in our Translational Science Platform to enhance our deep understanding of the TME, as we look to broaden the benefit of immunotherapy through targeting additional cell types;


• | Address the unmet need of cancer patients with tumors unresponsive to T effector cell-directed therapies by focusing our discovery efforts on other cell types within the TME; and


• | Expand our pipeline by leveraging our internal discovery platform and/or in-licensing new technologies and methodologies to turn cold tumors into hot tumors to make them more amenable to immunotherapy.

Immuno-Oncology Overview
Historically, cancer treatments have focused on either killing or arresting the proliferation of the tumor cells themselves. However, fundamental work pioneered by one of our founders, Dr. James Allison, led to the discovery of immune cell checkpoint therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors show promise in treating various cancers, with two immunotherapies that target the PD-1 receptor on certain T cells—pembrolizumab, marketed as Keytruda, and nivolumab, marketed as Opdivo—now approved in multiple cancer types and across different lines of therapy. The data emerging from clinical studies with these PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors (shown in Figure 1) suggests that:

1. | Certain indications, for example melanoma, appear to be more immuno-responsive than others.


2. | As these agents move to earlier lines of treatment, response rates increase, however, it is still only a minority of patients who benefit from monotherapy.


3. | Response rates may be increased by the use of biomarkers to select patients who may be more likely to benefit from immunotherapies.

Figure 1: Unmet Need/Therapeutic Opportunity
Even with the success of these PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, there is still a significant unmet need, as can be seen from Figure 1, which shows the Overall Response Rates, or the ORR, in patients treated with either of the approved anti-PD-1 antibody therapies as monotherapy in the indicated cancers. These data also highlight the importance of a biomarker-driven patient-enrichment strategy, like that used for Keytruda, in biomarker-selected first-line non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, subjects and in second line microsatellite-instability-high, or MSI-H, cancer patient populations. Additional highlights of the evolving immunotherapy landscape include longer-lasting responses as compared to chemotherapy and that these longer-lasting responses can be improved with combination therapy. 
The interplay between the immune system and cancer is dynamic and as more patients, in an expanded set of indications, are being exposed to cancer immunotherapies we are learning about the factors that may contribute to a lack of response or a failed response. Reasons for resistance to immunotherapy can include a lack of appropriate immune cells in the TME, for example, the absence of T effector cells or the presence of immunosuppressive cells such as tumor associated macrophages or T regulatory cells. In these cases, therapeutic approaches that target other cell types within the TME to convert colder tumors to hot tumors may broaden the applicability of cancer immunotherapies. In addition, a tumor may initially respond to a PD-1/PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy but other immune checkpoints may emerge or acquired resistance to the particular immunotherapy may occur, for example through genetic alterations in key T cell signaling pathways. In these instances, combination therapy approaches that target more than one checkpoint, or more than one mechanism, may be key to maximizing the benefit of cancer immunotherapies. As an example, clinical data demonstrates that the combination of Opdivo with Yervoy, which targets CTLA-4, a different protein receptor, on certain T cells, provides additional benefit to melanoma patients than either therapy alone. 
We believe that our Translational Science Platform, which enables both the identification and prioritization of targets across a broad spectrum of immune and non-immune cell types and the identification of potential biomarkers to inform our clinical development strategy, may position us to address multiple pathways and indications, including those that may be important in colder tumors, and to identify the most appropriate indications and most responsive patient populations for our new immunotherapies. By taking this dual approach, we believe we may be able to address areas of unmet need, particularly in the combination setting.
The promise of long-lasting benefit to cancer patients has led to heightened enthusiasm for these types of immunotherapy products and the rapid expansion of the market opportunity. The overall market for immunotherapy is expected to expand over the next five years, with 2023 market size estimates ranging from $37 billion to $58 billion across solid and blood-based tumors according to market reports.

Strategic Alliance with Celgene
In July 2016, we entered into a Master Research and Collaboration Agreement, or the Celgene Collaboration Agreement, with Celgene. The primary goal of the collaboration is to co-develop and co-commercialize innovative biologic immunotherapies that either activate or suppress the immune system by binding to targets identified by leveraging our Translational Science Platform. Under the agreement, we granted Celgene exclusive options to develop and commercialize our lead product candidate, JTX-2011, and up to four early-stage programs consisting of targets to be selected from a pool of certain B cell, T regulatory cell and tumor-associated macrophage targets. Additionally, Celgene has an exclusive option to develop and commercialize our product candidate JTX-4014, which, upon exercise of such option, will be a shared program that may be used by both parties in and outside of the collaboration. Prior to Celgene exercising an option for a program, we are responsible for all research and development activities for that program under the agreement during the collaboration, and subject to all costs and potential liabilities.
Advancement of biologics: For programs that have biologics that meet mutually agreed criteria for suitability for further development, Celgene may elect that program’s target (solely with respect to immune activation or immune suppression, as applicable) to be added to the pool of targets for which we may conduct further research subject to the terms of the collaboration. If we continue to conduct research and development for such programs, then such activity will be part of the collaboration. If Celgene does not elect a program that achieves such criteria, then we will retain the rights to such program’s targets and biologics and Celgene will not have an option to such program.
Exercise of options and further development of programs: Celgene may extend the initial four-year research term of the collaboration for up to three additional one-year periods upon payment of an extension fee for each additional year. Celgene may exercise its option for a program at any time until the expiration of an option term for that program. For each program, the option term ends 45 to 60 days following Celgene’s receipt of a data package that includes certain information relating to the program’s research and development activities. The data package for a program may be delivered to Celgene after the applicable development milestone for such program has been achieved. Depending on the program, the applicable development milestone is (i) IND acceptance, (ii) availability of certain Phase Ia data, or (iii) availability of certain Phase I/II data. If Celgene fails to exercise its option during the option term for a program, we will retain the rights to such program. If Celgene exercises its option for a program other than JTX-4014, then we will enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Celgene for such program in substantially the form attached to the agreement as an exhibit. Under the co-development and co-commercialization agreement for JTX-2011 and one additional program for which Celgene opts in that is not JTX-4014, we will be responsible for leading development and commercialization activities in the United States and Celgene will be responsible for development and commercialization activities outside the United States. For all other additional programs for which Celgene opts in, other than JTX-4014, Celgene will lead development and commercialization activities worldwide. If Celgene exercises its option for JTX-4014, we will enter into a license agreement, in substantially the form attached to the agreement as an exhibit, pursuant to which we will both be able to equally access JTX-4014 for combinations within our portfolios and with other molecules that are subject to the agreement, subject to joint governance. Once Celgene opts in with respect to a given program, Celgene and we must each use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the corresponding product in the United States.
Governance: The collaboration is governed by a joint steering committee, or JSC, and a joint patent committee. The JSC may establish additional subcommittees to oversee particular projects or activities. Subject to limitations specified in the agreement, if the applicable governance committee is unable to make a decision by consensus and the parties are unable to resolve the issue through escalation to specified senior executive officers of the parties, then we generally have final decision-making authority over research and development matters for programs prior to Celgene’s exercise of its option to such program. If Celgene exercises its option for a program, final decision-making authority for that program is specified in the applicable co-development and co-commercialization agreement or license agreement.
Exclusivity: During the collaboration’s research term (i.e., for four years plus up to three one-year extensions that Celgene may elect), we may not alone, or with a third party, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize a biologic that binds to a defined pool of B cell, T regulatory cell or tumor-associated macrophage targets that meet certain criteria, termed an exclusive target, and inhibit, activate or otherwise modulate the activity of such exclusive target. In addition, if Celgene exercises its option for a program within the collaboration other than JTX-4014, then until termination or expiration of the applicable co-development and co-commercialization agreement for such program, we may not directly or indirectly research, develop, manufacture or commercialize, outside of the collaboration, any biologic with specified activity against that program’s collaboration target.
6

Financial terms: Under the terms of the agreements, we received a $225.0 million upfront cash payment and $36.1 million from the sale of 10,448,100 shares of our Series B-1 convertible preferred stock to Celgene, which shares converted into 2,831,463 shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering. If Celgene exercises any of its options, then Celgene will pay us an option-exercise fee, the parties will enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement or a license agreement that governs the development and commercialization of the applicable program, and we will then split future development and commercialization costs with Celgene in accordance with such agreement. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, if Celgene exercises all of its options, all programs meet all milestones, including regulatory approvals in the United States and outside the United States, and Celgene extends the initial four-year research term for three additional years, we are eligible to earn up to approximately $2.6 billion in clinical, regulatory, and/or commercialization milestone payments, option-exercise fees and research term extension fees. 
The development milestones are payable on initiation of certain clinical trials and range from $32.5 million to $105.0 million, per program, with an aggregate total of $290.0 million. The regulatory approval milestones are payable upon regulatory approval in the United States and outside the United States and range from $7.5 million to $50.0 million per milestone, with an aggregate total of $700.0 million. The commercial milestones are payable upon achievement of specified aggregate product sales outside the United States for each program and range from $40.0 million to $200.0 million per milestone, with an aggregate total of $1.270 billion. We are also eligible to receive royalties on product sales outside the United States ranging from high single digit to mid-teen royalties. As of December 31, 2017, we had not received any option exercise, research term extension, milestone or royalty payments under the Celgene Collaboration Agreement. 
Profit sharing, cost sharing and commercialization rights for products: If Celgene exercises its option for a program, then we will share with Celgene the U.S. profits or losses on such collaboration program as follows:

• | We will retain 60 percent of the U.S. operating profits or losses arising from commercialization of JTX-2011, with 40 percent allocated to Celgene.


• | We will retain 25 percent of the U.S. operating profits or losses arising from commercialization of the first program, other than JTX-2011 or JTX-4014, for which an IND application is filed under the collaboration, with 75 percent allocated to Celgene. Celgene has a one-time right to substitute and swap the economics and governance of this program with that of another program for which it exercises an option (other than JTX-2011 and JTX-4014).


• | We and Celgene will equally share U.S. operating profits or losses arising from commercialization of up to three additional programs (other than JTX-2011 or JTX-4014).


• | We and Celgene will share all development costs, other than for JTX-4014, in accordance with the applicable co-development and co-commercialization agreement.

If Celgene exercises its option for a program other than JTX-4014, we will enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement, pursuant to which Celgene will have the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the products arising out of such collaboration program outside of the United States, and we will be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from a high single digit to mid-teen percentage rate on net product sales outside of the United States. Under each co-development and co-commercialization agreement, we will also have the right to opt out of profit sharing in the United States and instead receive milestones and royalties.
Furthermore, if Celgene exercises its option for JTX-4014, we will enter into a license agreement, pursuant to which Celgene and we will each have equal rights to develop and commercialize JTX-4014 in combination with other proprietary molecules in their or our respective pipelines or in combination with products arising out of collaboration programs. Subject to terms specified in the license agreement for JTX-4014, the party owning the proprietary molecule that is combined with JTX-4014, if such molecule does not arise from a collaboration program with Celgene, will be solely responsible for all development and commercialization costs related to such combination. If JTX-4014 is combined with a product arising from a collaboration program, then the parties will share costs and, if co-packaged or co-formulated, profits or losses in accordance with the co-development and co-commercialization agreement for such other product.
Intellectual Property: We and Celgene will jointly own any intellectual property that is generated or invented by both parties pursuant to the activities conducted under the collaboration agreement. If Celgene exercises its option for a program, each party will also grant the other party exclusive or co-exclusive licenses, with rights to grant sublicenses, under certain of each party’s intellectual property rights, determined by the nature of the program and the licensed territory.
7

Termination: At any point during the collaboration agreement, including during the research, development and clinical trial process, or during the term of the applicable co-development and co-commercialization or license agreement, respectively, Celgene can terminate the applicable agreement with us in its entirety, or with respect to any program under the collaboration agreement, upon 120 days’ notice and can terminate the entire agreement with us in connection with a material breach of the agreement by us that remains uncured for 90 days.
Our Product Pipeline
We are developing a pipeline of immunotherapies that we believe will provide a meaningful and long-lasting benefit to cancer patients. We plan to develop each of these as a single agent and/or in combination with other therapies, as applicable. The following table depicts our current pipeline: 
Lead Program JTX-2011: an Anti-ICOS Monoclonal Antibody Immunotherapy
Our lead product candidate, JTX-2011 is in clinical development in an adaptive Phase I/II clinical trial which we refer to as ICONIC. Currently, this is an open label, dose escalation and expansion trial of JTX-2011 alone or in combination with a fixed dose of nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have failed all available therapies and have no standard options. The monotherapy and combination with nivolumab Phase II portions of the trial were initiated in April and July of 2017, respectively.
JTX-2011 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and activates ICOS, a protein on the surface of certain T cells. JTX-2011 was designed with a human IgG1 Fc portion, which we believe contributes to a dual mechanism of action whereby JTX-2011 amplifies an immune response in T effector cells, or "good" T cells, while preferentially reducing the number of T regulatory cells, or "bad" T cells, within a tumor. 
Preclinical data suggest that, through its dual mechanism of action, JTX-2011 has the potential to act as a monotherapy that may offer treatment alternatives to patients who otherwise lack an effective response to currently approved therapies. 
The initial data on the safety, pharmacokinetic, or PK, and pharmacodynamics, or PD, from the Phase I portion of ICONIC, comprised of data from patients with any relapsed or refractory advanced solid cancers with no biomarker enrichment, was presented in June 2017 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, annual meeting. Patients in the Phase I portion of ICONIC were heavily pre-treated, with a median of four prior therapies. The safety data were consistent with studies of approved PD-1 inhibitors in similar patients and the human PK and PD data were consistent with the model that was developed based on preclinical requirements for efficacy.
8

Based on preclinical data in mouse tumor models that suggested a correlation between a higher percentage of ICOS-expressing immune cells in the tumor and response to monotherapy ICOS agonist antibody, the Phase II portion of ICONIC is composed of disease-specific cohorts in certain tumor types that appear to have higher percentage of ICOS-expressing immune cells within the tumor. The JTX-2011 monotherapy cohorts include NSCLC, head and neck squamous cell cancer, or HNSCC, and gastric cancer and the adaptive nature of the trial allows for the addition of new tumor types identified through our Translational Science Platform.
The inducible nature of the ICOS target which can be upregulated on T cells following exposure to multiple agents, including anti-PD-1 antibodies, offers the potential to combine treatment of JTX-2011 with a PD-1 inhibitor. Patients with NSCLC, HNSCC, triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, melanoma, and gastric cancer, as well as additional tumor types identified through our Translational Science Platform, are included in the Phase II combination therapy cohorts with the anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab. 
Patients in both the monotherapy and combination cohorts with tumors for which a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor is approved must have had progressive disease on or after treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. These tumor types include NSCLC, HNSCC, melanoma and gastric cancer. Our gastric cancer combination cohort of the Phase II portion of ICONIC commenced in July 2017, prior to approval of Keytruda for gastric cancer. Therefore, our gastric cohorts include PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor naive patients as well as patients who have failed a prior PD-1 inhibitor. 
In both the monotherapy and combination tumor-specific cohorts, the patients with relapsed or refractory solid cancers, who are heavily pre-treated, are stratified based on ICOS levels, as determined by immunohistochemistry. In certain cohorts, ICOS levels are analyzed for each patient using archival tumor and the number of patients with ICOS low tumors enrolled in each cohort is limited. Enrollment in each cohort continues until sufficient patients with ICOS high tumors are enrolled, based on a fresh pre-treatment biopsy. Additional potential predictive biomarkers, including an ICOS gene signature, will also be evaluated for their utility in identifying patients who may be more likely to respond to JTX-2011 therapy. 
The Phase II combination cohorts of JTX-2011 and nivolumab in gastric cancer and TNBC have met their enrollment targets, and we expect to report overall safety and preliminary efficacy data from these cohorts, plus complementary data from the Phase II JTX-2011 monotherapy cohort in gastric cancer and additional patients with these tumor types enrolled in Phase I in the second quarter of 2018.
Although our initial combination cohorts of the ICONIC trial focus on the combination of JTX-2011 with an anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, the ability of other agents to induce ICOS upregulation on T cells, including anti-PD-1 antibodies, anti-PD-L1 antibodies, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and cancer vaccines such as GVAX, PROSTVAC, and Mammaglobin-A, offers the potential for combinations with JTX-2011. In addition to continuing to investigate JTX-2011 in combination with nivolumab, we plan to initiate new dose-escalation cohorts of JTX-2011 in combination with the approved CTLA-4 inhibitor, ipilimumab, within the ICONIC trial in 2018. We believe this inducible nature of ICOS to be a cornerstone of our strategy in combination trials. By combining with other approved therapies, JTX-2011 may provide the potential to maximize the benefit of immunotherapeutic approaches across a broad spectrum of indications. 
JTX-4014: An Anti-PD-1 Antibody for Combination Therapy
Combination therapy aimed at multiple targets has become an important element of immunotherapy development efforts with the goal of creating even better, long-lasting responses. PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors are anticipated to play a key role in combination therapies. For this reason, we are developing our own anti-PD-1 antagonist antibody, JTX-4014, for use in combinations with potential future product candidates.
We expect to file an IND for JTX-4014 in 2018 and, assuming continued successful development, JTX-4014 will be evaluated as a monotherapy prior to moving into combination settings where we anticipate JTX-4014 will provide us flexibility to optimize potential combination therapy approaches.
Beyond T Effector Cell Discovery Programs
With our focus on bringing the right immunotherapy to the right patients, we have invested heavily in our Translational Science Platform as we believe that the systematic interrogation of the immune make-up of human tumors gives us the ability to target different cell types within the TME beyond the T effector cells that are the focus of currently approved immunotherapies. This may enable us to fully exploit the promise of immunotherapy in cancer by allowing us to pursue tumor types not currently served by therapies that target the T effector arm of the adaptive 
9

immune system, as well as potentially convert the TME from an immunosuppressive environment to an immune activating environment and thereby convert cold tumors to hot tumors. 
Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas, or TCGA, using our proprietary gene signatures, which represent various immune cells, shows that the immune cell composition of tumors is diverse, both across and within indications, and suggests that a significant number of tumors, including cold tumors in particular, may not benefit from the current T-cell focused immunotherapies such as the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors (Figure 2). 
Figure 2: Characterization of human tumors by immune profiling using cell-specific gene signatures
Our early discovery efforts include programs that target adaptive immune cells, including T regulatory cells and innate cells, such as immunosuppressive macrophages. Immunosuppressive macrophages are highly prevalent in many solid tumor types, including many cold tumors, and their presence is associated with poorer disease prognosis; therefore, we prioritized macrophage targets for our initial foray into developing more effective cancer therapies to address colder tumors. Using our Translational Science Platform, we have identified potential targets on immunosuppressive M2 macrophages that, when treated with specific monoclonal antibodies, may influence the composition of macrophages within the TME, with the goal of converting, but not depleting, the immune-suppressing M2 to immune-enhancing M1 macrophages, thus engaging the innate immune system in the response to cancer.  
We have commenced IND-enabling activities for the first potential candidate to emerge from our macrophage-focused efforts and we have generated encouraging in vitro data and ex vivo data using human tumor histoculture 
10

demonstrating an ability of this antibody to promote an immune-activating phenotype in otherwise suppressive macrophages. 
We are generating and screening other antibodies identified using our macrophage-specific approach that are focused on other targets for their potential as cancer immunotherapies. We are also leveraging our Translational Science Platform to systematically and comprehensively interrogate cell types within the TME, including non-immune cells such as stromal cells, with the goal of enabling us to develop therapies to benefit patients with tumors across the hot to cold spectrum. We believe that some of our discovery approaches, including targeting stromal cells, may identify product candidates with the potential to address a significant unmet medical need by turning cold tumors hot and making them amenable to PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, such as JTX-4014.
Manufacturing
We rely on and will continue to rely on our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for both drug substance and drug product. While we do not plan to develop our own full-scale manufacturing capabilities, we may consider establishing a small, flexible approach for supporting preclinical IND enabling studies and early clinical studies. As of now, all of our manufacturing is outsourced to well-established third-party manufacturers. We have entered into a long-term contract with a CMO for drug supply to our JTX-2011 and JTX-4014 clinical trials. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the immunotherapy subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our product candidates, discovery programs, technology, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.
Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any complementary diagnostics and/or companion diagnostics. Potentially competitive therapies fall primarily into the following groups of treatment:

• | traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy;


• | two anti-ICOS antibody programs in clinical trials, the first being developed by GlaxoSmithKline plc, for which patient enrollment in a Phase I trial began in the second quarter of 2016 and the second being developed by Bristol Myers Squibb Company, for which patient enrollment in a Phase I/II trial began in the third quarter of 2017;


• | approved immunotherapy antibodies, including an approved anti-CTLA 4 antibody (Yervoy, marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb Company) and approved anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies (Opdivo, Keytruda, Tecentriq, Bavencio and Imfizi, marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb Company, Merck & Co., Genentech, Inc., Merck KGaA and Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca PLC, respectively);


• | anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy antibodies in clinical development;


• | other agonist immunotherapy antibodies in clinical development; and


• | therapies targeting macrophages, T regulatory cells and B cells that are in clinical development.

The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. In addition, our competitors may obtain Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Many of the companies against which we may compete, either alone or with their strategic partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, novel biological discoveries, including new targets and applications, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, generally we intend to first pursue patent protection covering both compositions of matter and methods of use. As we continue the development of our product candidates, we intend to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through additional methods of use and biomarker and complementary diagnostic and/or companion diagnostic related claims.
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates. As of February 28, 2018, with respect to JTX-2011 patent rights, we own two pending U.S. provisional patent applications, one pending U.S. non-provisional application, twenty-six pending foreign patent applications, and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent application within three patent families that cover compositions of matter and methods of use and ICOS-related biomarkers, and we do not own any issued patents. As of February 28, 2018, with respect to JTX-4014 patent rights, we own one pending U.S. non-provisional application, three pending foreign patent applications, and one pending PCT patent application within one patent family that covers compositions of matter and methods of use, and we do not own any issued patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we pursue will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide any proprietary protection from competitors. Even if our pending patent applications are granted as issued patents, those patents, as well as any patents we license from third parties, may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
In addition, we exclusively in-licensed a patent portfolio from Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Memorial Hospital for Cancer, or MSK, and University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, or MD Anderson, consisting of two issued U.S. patents, one issued Japanese patent, one issued Chinese patent, one pending U.S. patent application, and four pending foreign patent applications. This licensed patent portfolio covers methods related to the use of an ICOS agonist in combination with blocking agents of certain T cell inhibitory receptors. The issued patents and the pending patent applications (if issued) licensed from MSK and MD Anderson, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, are expected to expire in 2030, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
We also rely on unpatented know-how, inventions and other proprietary information relating to JTX-2011, JTX-4014 and our other future product candidates. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These 
12

agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Exclusive License Agreement with Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases
In September 2015, we amended and restated an exclusive license agreement from December 2013 with Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, MSK and Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases. Pursuant to this amended and restated license agreement, MSK and MD Anderson granted to us a worldwide exclusive license under certain patents to manufacture, develop and commercialize certain products and services, including those products for which the use in combination with another product for the treatment of any disease is covered by such patents (including, potentially, JTX-2011), and to practice certain methods covered by the patents.
Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize at least one licensed product or licensed service as defined in the license agreement. We also are required to achieve the following developmental milestones by the end of 2019: achievement of initial efficacy of proof of concept, identification of a development candidate, and filing of an IND application with the FDA. As of September 30, 2016, we have achieved all of these milestones.
In connection with the license agreement, we issued to MSK and MD Anderson an aggregate of 60,974 shares of our common stock. We also paid an upfront license fee of $30,000 to MSK and MD Anderson. Commencing on the third anniversary of the effective date of the license agreement, we must pay an annual maintenance fee ranging in the mid-four figures to the mid-five figures. The annual maintenance fee is fully credited against the royalty payments for the same year or any subsequent year or any other amount due under the license agreement. We are obligated to pay MSK milestone payments of up to $3,475,000 for the first and second licensed products to achieve certain development and marketing approval milestones, including up to $2,725,000 for the first licensed product to achieve such developmental and marketing approval milestones. On a country-by-country basis and licensed product-by-licensed product or licensed service-by-licensed service basis, we are also obligated to pay MSK a low single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of licensed products or licensed services, to the extent used in combination with another product for the treatment of any disease covered by the applicable patents, until the earlier of the expiration of the last valid patent claim covering such licensed product or licensed service in such country or twelve years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product or licensed service in such country. If we sublicense our rights under our license agreement with MSK, we would be obligated to pay MSK a low double-digit percentage royalty of the total gross proceeds we receive in consideration of the grant of the sublicense, excluding royalties, research and development funding, payments for equity or debt securities and certain other expenses we have incurred that are reimbursed by the sublicensee.
Unless terminated earlier, the license agreement expires on the date that we no longer have any royalty payment obligations under the license agreement. We may terminate the license agreement for convenience in its entirety upon 30 days’ prior written notice to MSK and MD Anderson. Either party may terminate the license agreement in its entirety in the event of an uncured material breach or the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up of the other party which is not dismissed or cured within a set period of time. If we terminate the license agreement because of MSK’s and MD Anderson’s uncured breach or insolvency, we will retain a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free worldwide license to the licensed patents. Upon expiration of our obligation to pay royalties for a licensed product or service in a country, our license to the licensed patents for such licensed product or service will become exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up and royalty-free in such country.

Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as JTX-2011, JTX-4014 and any future product candidates. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations and regulates biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
JTX-2011, JTX-4014 and any future product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a New Drug Application, or NDA, or Biologics License Application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. We expect JTX-2011, JTX-4014 and other future product candidates to be regulated by the FDA as biologics and require the submission of a BLA prior be being marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;


• | determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.

Preclinical Studies and IND
The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to evaluate toxicity, assess the potential for adverse events and, in some cases, establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit 
14

the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at such institution, approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on available data from the study. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase I, Phase II and Phase III, which may overlap.

• | Phase I clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.


• | Phase II clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.


• | Phase III clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from animal or in vitro testing or other studies that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete 
15

additional animal studies and must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that JTX-2011, JTX-4014 and any future product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
NDA/BLA and FDA Review Process
The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA. The NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The FDA must approve the NDA or BLA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, currently $2,421,495 for an application requiring clinical data for fiscal year 2018, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual product or program fees, currently $304,162 per program. These fees may be increased or decreased annually and fee waivers, reductions or deferrals are available in certain circumstances. 
The FDA reviews each NDA and BLA for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following receipt by the FDA of the NDA or BLA. If the submission is found to be complete, the FDA will file the NDA or BLA, triggering a full review. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. The established goal of the FDA is to review applications within ten months of the filing date for a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA and within six months from the filing date for a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect the manufacturing facilities for the new product and will not approve the product unless the facilities comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. Additionally, the FDA may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved, such as requiring additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. These circumstances are where another product shows clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity because it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient 
16

care. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances. 
Competitors may also receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if one of our products is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has various programs, including a fast track program, priority review and accelerated approval, that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that, generally, are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition, demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs and that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. The fast track program is designed to facilitate the development and review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fulfill unmet needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. 
A candidate product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, the investigational product must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. 
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or BLA or supplement to a NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The assessment must also support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, requires the submission of a pediatric study plan prior to the assessment of data, which must contain proposed pediatric study, including study design and objectives, any deferral or waiver requests, and any other information required by regulation. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data until after the approval of the drug for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extensions of deferrals are contained in FDASIA.
Post-marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs 
17

for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals, including imposing limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed, requiring that warning statements be included in the product labeling, requiring that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, imposing restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limiting the scope of any approval. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including recall.
Companion Diagnostics and Complementary Diagnostics
We believe that the success of our product candidates may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of either a companion diagnostic or complementary diagnostic. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product, identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product, or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and, as such, require either clearance or approval prior to commercialization. The level of risk combined with available controls to mitigate risk determines whether a companion diagnostic device requires Premarket Approval Application approval or is cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under FDA guidance, for a novel therapeutic product for which a companion diagnostic device is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or 510(k)-cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic. The use of the companion diagnostic device will be stipulated in the labeling of the therapeutic product. This is also true for a complementary diagnostic, although it is not a prerequisite for receiving the therapeutic.
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. 
18

Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers also can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs or biologics, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. 
Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Affordable Care Act. The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects us to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of JTX-2011, JTX-4014 and any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity; a drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. 
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, as part of the Affordable Care Act. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
A reference biological product is granted twelve years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. It is necessary to 
19

determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity and, for subsequent applications, such determinations are made a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. As of January 1, 2018, the FDA has approved nine biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars have been approved. 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods or patent protection. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. Furthermore, a biological product seeking licensure as biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product indicated for a rare disease or condition and granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity may not be licensed by the FDA for the protected orphan indication until after the expiration of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period or the 12-year reference product exclusivity, whichever is later.
Foreign Regulation
As in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future products and medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to the national health authority and an independent ethics committee in each country in which the company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical study may proceed. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs and other applicable regulatory requirements and ethical principles. 
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, region-specific document requirements. 
The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If grated, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. If we obtain approval in the future to market any our product candidates, we may seek approval 
20

and coverage for those products under Medicaid, Medicare and the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program and may seek approval to sell the products to federal agencies. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay a rebate for each product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation.
Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government. The program covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that are not administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time to time.
Medicare Part B covers most injectable drugs given in an in-patient setting, and some drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient departments and doctors’ offices. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage decision. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for Part B covered drugs based on a percentage of a manufacturer-reported average sales price. 
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs.
Since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise.
Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or 
21

patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
