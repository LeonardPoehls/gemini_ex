NAMI Corp. (formerly known as Pack Fuerte, Inc.) (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 2012. November 30th has been established as the Company’s fiscal year end.
 
On October 31, 2016, a change in control of the Company occurred by virtue of the Company's largest shareholder, Bunloet Sriphanorm, selling 60,750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to Ong Tee Keat, an individual residing in Malaysia, which represented 60.22% of the Company’s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock at that time. Such 60,750,000 shares sold represented all of the shares of the Company’s common stock owned by Mr. Sriphanorm.
 
On October 31, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the “Nevada SOS”) whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by (a) increasing the Company’s authorized number of shares of common stock from 200 million to 5 billion; and (b) increasing all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of seven (7) shares for every one (1) share held. The Company’s Board of Directors approved this amendment on October 26, 2016. 
 
On November 3, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada SOS whereby it entered into a statutory merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, NAMI Corp. pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200 et. seq. The effect of such merger is that the Company was the surviving entity and changed its name to “NAMI Corp.” 
 
Effective December 13, 2016, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company appointed Mr. Ong Tee Keat as Chairman of the Board of Directors, CEO, Secretary, and Treasurer, and Binloet Sriphanorm resigned from his positions as an officer and director of the Company.
