Item 1. | Business

We are a leading provider of cloud-based platform solutions designed to help small- and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, succeed online. We serve approximately 5.37 million subscribers globally with a comprehensive suite of products and services that help SMBs get online, get found and grow their businesses. Historically, our products focused largely on web hosting and other basic web presence solutions such as domains, but over time we have expanded to offer security, site backup, premium domains, search engine optimization (“SEO”) and search engine marketing (“SEM”), Google Adwords, mobile solutions, social media enablement, website analytics, email marketing and productivity and e-commerce tools, among others. More recently, we have launched additional products and services, including website builders, mobile site builders and new hosting brands, both to satisfy existing subscriber needs and to expand the product gateways through which new subscribers initially reach us. We refer to these newer products and services as “gateway products”.
On February 9, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Constant Contact, Inc., or Constant Contact, for $32.00 per share in cash, for a total purchase price of approximately $1.1 billion. Constant Contact is a leading provider of online marketing tools that are designed for small organizations, including small businesses, associations and non-profits. This acquisition combined two leaders in small business online products and services, allowing us to offer a comprehensive suite of online marketing tools and end-to-end solutions for our subscribers. 
Market Opportunity 
Small and medium businesses represent a large and diverse market, both in the United States and internationally. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, there were approximately 29 million small businesses in the United States in 2013, of which approximately 23 million were non-employer firms, or companies that do not have paid employees. Worldwide, there were estimated to be approximately 75 million SMBs in 2014. 
We believe the growth in global Internet penetration and the proliferation of mobile devices are changing the way in which consumers discover and transact with businesses. As a result, SMBs are increasingly adopting technology to operate and grow their businesses, but the market penetration of web presence and marketing technologies among SMBs remains limited. Studies indicate that of U.S. SMBs with one to ten employees, almost half do not have a website, and that only 40% of U.S. SMBs with 100 or fewer employees use email to advertise or promote their business. Worldwide, many SMBs, particularly in emerging markets, are moving online due to wider availability of Internet infrastructure and mobile connectivity. We believe that these factors result in a significant worldwide market opportunity for us.
Our Products and Services
Many SMBs (particularly those with five or fewer employees, which we believe represent the majority of our SMB subscribers) have limited technological and marketing expertise, time and financial resources. To address these challenges, we offer a comprehensive suite of products and services that help SMBs get online, get found and grow their businesses quickly, easily and affordably. Our offerings, which consist of both proprietary applications and third-party products, can be broadly grouped as follows: 
Getting SMBs Online 
We provide SMBs an easy and cost-effective way to create an online presence.
Web Hosting. By providing a consolidated set of core products that combine storage, bandwidth and processing power, our entry-level shared hosting services enable subscribers to create an initial web presence quickly and cost-effectively. We also offer a new Cloud Sites offering for customers who are looking for more power and flexibility as their businesses start to scale, but are not yet ready for more advanced Virtual Private Server ("VPS") or dedicated hosting solutions.
Website Builders. We offer website building tools that enable subscribers with varying degrees of technical sophistication to create a customized web presence. We also offer various premium elements that subscribers can purchase separately to enhance their website and provide a more engaging user experience for their customers, including premium themes, mobile optimization, social networking features, customer interaction tools, embedded videos, photo galleries, blogs, maps, polls and community forums. 
2

Domain Registration, Management and Resale. As an accredited domain registrar with approximately 12 million domains under our management at December 31, 2016, we enable our subscribers to search and purchase available domain names from a wide spectrum of domain registries. We also maintain a portfolio of premium domains that are available for resale to our subscribers. 
Security. We offer malware protection solutions to help protect our subscribers’ websites from viruses, malicious code and other threats. Our premium offerings, including a web application firewall, can help prevent attacks on subscriber websites before they affect subscriber data or operations. For subscribers that collect personally identifiable information or other private data from their customers and website visitors, we offer a variety of Secure Socket Layer, or SSL, certificates that encrypt data collected on a subscriber’s website. We also offer products that help subscribers achieve payment card industry compliance for maintaining sensitive information. 
Site Back-Up. We offer enhanced backup control solutions that enable subscribers to schedule, maintain, manage and restore backups of their online data and websites to meet their particular business needs. 
Mojo Marketplace. Mojo Marketplace is an online marketplace for WordPress themes, plugins and other digital goods. We make Mojo Marketplace available to subscribers of many of our main web presence brands, as well as through MOJOMarketplace.com. We plan to further enhance MOJOMarketplace.com during 2017. 
Getting SMBs Found 
Our marketing solutions enable subscribers to increase their online visibility, attract more customers to their websites and build customer loyalty. 
Mobile. We offer solutions that allow our subscribers to have their websites rendered on mobile devices and target mobile customers for their businesses, among other features and functionality. Our website builder solutions offer mobile-ready templates, which enable small businesses to ensure that their websites render well on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Search Engine Marketing (SEM). We offer a variety of search engine optimization and marketing solutions that can improve a subscriber’s ability to be discovered by potential customers. These services help a subscriber distribute its business profile to online directories and manage links and keywords with on-page diagnostic tools. We also offer fully managed pay-per-click (PPC) services designed to direct traffic to a subscriber’s website, email or phone. 
Social Media. We offer tools and services that enable our subscribers to communicate effectively with their customers and potential customers through social networks. Our solutions enable our subscribers to easily integrate their website content and sales and marketing efforts into Facebook, Twitter and other forms of social media, and track the results of their social media campaigns. 
Analytics. We offer control panels and dashboards that enable our subscribers to analyze activity on their websites and optimize the impact of their web presence design and marketing campaigns to more effectively reach their customers. 
Helping SMBs Grow 
We offer a wide array of applications and services that can help our subscribers grow their businesses over time by enabling them to have dedicated processing power to drive their websites, consistently get in front of their customers, collaborate more efficiently with their employees, partners and customers, better manage their businesses, and have advanced, secure online payment services. 
Advanced Web Hosting. In addition to providing shared hosting services, we also provide VPS hosting and dedicated hosting solutions. As a subscriber’s business expands and the demands on its website increase, these more customizable and higher performance solutions allow our subscribers to build additional functionality into their websites, offer high bandwidth content and drive more commerce and marketing activities while reducing load times and increasing site speeds. Subscribers can start with an advanced web hosting solution or upgrade from an existing shared hosting service.
Email Marketing. Constant Contact’s email marketing product allows small businesses and other small organizations to easily create, send and track professional-looking email campaigns, allowing them to communicate effectively with their customers and potential customers via email. Email marketing services available to subscribers include building and segmenting mailing lists, designing and managing email newsletters, coupons and landing pages, scheduling and sending email messages, and reporting and tracking the results of each campaign.

We offer our Constant Contact email marketing products on a stand-alone basis and through bundled offerings that combine email marketing with other marketing offerings, including running promotions, managing events online, conducting surveys and getting feedback, and marketing automation capabilities. 
Productivity Solutions. We offer our subscribers email capabilities, including custom mailboxes that reflect a subscriber’s domain name, spam filters, email aliases and forwarding functionality. Our communications tools also allow a subscriber to unify its email inbox with other communications streams, such as social media feeds. Through our partnership with Google, we also offer our customers Google Apps for Work, which includes an integrated suite of email, collaboration, and file sharing tools. 
E-commerce Enablement. As our subscribers grow their businesses and their demands on e-commerce increase, we offer products that enable secure and encrypted payments, shopping carts, payment processing and related services, mobile payments and other forms of e-commerce to expand the way SMBs conduct business online. 
Professional Services. For subscribers who have extensive demands for web design, content aggregation and presentation or have unique requirements for their web presence, we offer professional services with dedicated engineering and web design to help them create their ideal web presence complete with integration with some of the more advanced e-commerce, productivity and marketing products we offer. 
SinglePlatform. Our SinglePlatform product provides local businesses the ability to create and manage digital storefront listings through one interface. The digital storefront, which may include menus, photos, services, offers and featured products, is distributed online across over 100 online publishers, including multiple websites and mobile applications such as Yelp, Urbanspoon, Foursquare, YellowPages, WhitePages and TripAdvisor. SinglePlatform increases a merchant’s reach and helps small businesses to be found online and via mobile sites by consumers. 
Reportable Segments
Following our acquisition of Constant Contact in the first quarter of 2016, we determined that our business consisted of two operating segments, and that those segments meet the aggregation criteria under the relevant accounting rules to be treated as one reportable segment. In early 2017, however, we determined that Constant Contact is a separate reportable segment from our web presence business, due primarily to economic differences between Constant Contact and our web presence business that had become apparent by the fourth quarter of 2016. We now report two reportable segments: our web presence business, which is predominately our legacy business, and Constant Contact, which we refer to as our email marketing segment. We have reported these two reportable segments for 2016. 
Web Presence. Our web presence segment consists of web hosting, domains and the related products and services listed above under “Products and Services” (other than email marketing and SinglePlatform). 
Email Marketing. Our email marketing segment consists of the products and services historically offered by Constant Contact, principally email marketing, but also including event marketing, survey tools and SinglePlatform. 
Information about our reportable segments is set forth in Note 20 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Sales & Marketing
The SMB market is broad, diverse and fragmented in terms of geography, industry, size and degree of technological sophistication. As a result, we use a multi-brand approach to precisely target the SMB universe, identify the best ways to reach different categories of subscribers and tailor our brands and service offerings specifically toward those audiences. For example, within our web presence segment, our iPage brand targets SMBs who have less technical experience and are looking for a simpler solution; our HostGator brand targets web professionals; and our Bluehost brand targets Wordpress users. This multi-brand approach allows us to provide a diverse base of subscribers with a relevant experience on our platform. 
For our web presence segment, the majority of our program marketing expense is associated with targeted PPC-based online marketing and with payments to our large network of referral partners, who drive subscribers to us on a paid referral basis. Payments to our referral partners occur after a subscriber signs up on our platform and therefore allow us to readily determine the returns on our marketing spend. We also attract a significant percentage of our new subscribers through word-of-mouth referrals. In addition to PPC, referral channels and word-of mouth referrals, we have entered into strategic partnerships that help us reach additional subscribers, such as our partnerships with Google and WordPress. 
4

In the past, we have not invested significantly in television or radio advertising for our web presence segment. In 2017, we plan to modestly increase our expenditures in these areas in order to strengthen brand awareness for certain key web presence brands, particularly our HostGator and Bluehost brands, in order to address a trend among consumers to search for web presence and marketing solutions using brand-related search terms rather than generic search terms such as “shared hosting” or “website builder”.
For our email marketing segment, we market our products and acquire our customers through a variety of sources, including online marketing, such as search engines and advertising with online networks and other websites, offline marketing through television and radio advertising, local seminars, relationships with our partners, outbound sales efforts, referrals from our customer base, general brand awareness and a link to our website in the footer of substantially all of the emails sent by our customers. We have partner relationships with over 10,000 local and national small business service providers. These partners refer customers to us through links on their websites and outbound promotions to their customers or allow us to market to their customers directly. Our television and radio advertising is designed to educate potential customers about our marketing solutions and raise awareness of our brand. Our regional initiatives include local seminars and local online marketing. In addition, a significant number of our new email marketing subscribers come to us from word-of-mouth referrals from our existing subscribers and from the inclusion of a link to our website in the footer of substantially all of the emails sent by our subscribers. 
Subscriber Support 
Our support agents assist our subscribers via phone, email, chat and social media. We use data analytics and subscriber management software to help us deliver targeted support, which we believe enables us to deepen relationships with our subscribers and help them succeed as they grow. Our support personnel not only assist subscribers with technical issues, but also focus on understanding the business goals of each subscriber to help identify the right products and services to achieve those goals. Our primary support centers are located in Arizona, Colorado, Massachusetts, Texas, Brazil and India. We also currently have a support center for our Bluehost brand in Utah, but are in the process of transferring Bluehost support operations to our Tempe, Arizona facility and expect that process will be completed by the end of 2017. In addition, we have third-party support arrangements in India, China and the Philippines. 
Technology Platform and Infrastructure
Web Presence Segment
The technology platform supporting our web presence segment combines open source and proprietary software, and is based on a scalable architecture that allows us to operate with a large number of subscribers per server, which helps keep our capital expenditures relatively low. In addition, we have built subscriber relationship management, billing and subscriber service support systems to on-board, serve and track our web presence subscribers, and to enable them to manage their own service experience. 
We employ various techniques to enhance the stability of our systems and preserve the security of information contained on them. Within our web presence segment, our systems are not fully redundant. While the redundancies we do have in place will permit us to respond, at least to some degree, to failures of applications and systems, our data centers are vulnerable in the event of failure. With respect to data security, we utilize monitoring systems and a variety of software components to monitor and protect our infrastructure against attempts to attack or gain unauthorized entry to our internal systems and subscriber websites; however, like other companies generally and Internet-based organizations in particular, we remain vulnerable to targeted attacks aimed at exploiting network and system applications or weaknesses. See "Risk Factors" for additional information on disaster recovery, redundancy and data security risks. 
We currently serve most of our web presence subscribers from four U.S.-based data centers, one of which is owned by us and the rest of which are co-located. 
Email Marketing Segment
For our email marketing segment, our on-demand products use a central application and a single software code base with unique accounts for each subscriber, except for SinglePlatform, which operates on a separate code base. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of providing our products across our entire customer base. In addition, because we have one central application, we believe we are able to scale our business to meet increases in demand for our products. Scalability is achieved through advanced use of application partitioning to allow for horizontal scaling across multiple sets of applications. This structure enables individual application subsystems to scale independently as required by volume and usage. 
We own all of the hardware deployed in support of our platform, except for SinglePlatform, which operates on a third party’s infrastructure. We continuously monitor the performance and availability of our products. We have a highly available, 
5

scalable infrastructure that utilizes load-balanced web server pools, redundant interconnected network switches and firewalls, replicated databases, and fault-tolerant storage devices. Production data is backed up on a daily basis and stored in multiple locations to ensure transactional integrity and restoration capability. 
Our production system hardware and the disaster recovery hardware for our production system, with the exception of SinglePlatform, are co-located in third-party hosting facilities in Massachusetts and Texas.
Engineering and Development 
Our engineering and development activity is focused on enhancing our systems, improving and expanding product and service offerings, and developing new features and offerings, as well as integrating technology capabilities from our acquisitions. Our engineering and development expense during 2014, 2015 and 2016 was $19.5 million, $26.7 million and $87.6 million, respectively, or approximately 3.1%, 3.6% and 7.9% of revenues, respectively. 
Subscriber Profile 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 5.37 million subscribers, of which approximately 0.5 million were Constant Contact subscribers. Based on data from a 2015 survey of subscribers of major brands in our web presence segment, approximately 80% are SMBs, and the majority of SMB subscribers are businesses with five or fewer employees. We estimate that approximately 80% of subscribers of our email marketing segment employ 25 or fewer employees. 
The industries in which our subscribers operate are very diverse, including retail, professional services, non-profits, merchandising, media, recreation, education, construction, health, beauty and wellness, and arts and entertainment, among others. 
Geographical Information 
We currently maintain offices and conduct operations primarily in the United States, Brazil, India, and the Netherlands. We also have third-party support arrangements in India, China and the Philippines. 
Information about the geographic location of our long-lived assets and revenue is set forth in Note 22 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Competition 
The global cloud-based services market for SMBs is highly competitive and constantly evolving. We expect competition to increase from existing competitors as well as potential new market entrants. Our competitors include providers of: 

• | offerings designed to help SMBs establish an initial web presence, such as domain name registrars and shared hosting providers, including GoDaddy, Web.com and United Internet; website builders, such as Squarespace and Wix; website creation and management companies, e-commerce service providers, security solutions providers and site backup companies;


• | solutions that help SMBs get found online, such as SEM companies, SEO companies, local directory listing companies and online and offline business directories;


• | more advanced solutions targeted at growing SMBs, such as companies offering VPS, cloud hosting and dedicated hosting services, advanced e-commerce and security products and productivity tools; and


• | in the case of our email marketing segment, other email marketing vendors focused on the SMB market, including MailChimp.

We expect continued competition, both domestically and internationally, from competitors in the domain, hosting and website builder markets such as GoDaddy, Wix, Squarespace, Web.com and United Internet, as well as potential increased competition from large companies like Amazon, which offers cloud web hosting through Amazon Web Services; Google, which now offers a website building tool; and Facebook, which offers Facebook Pages for businesses and an Internet marketing platform. For our email marketing segment, we expect continued competition from MailChimp and other SMB-focused vendors. In some instances, we have commercial partnerships with companies with which we also compete.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the cloud-based services market for SMBs include: ease of use and effectiveness; product functionality, performance and reliability; customer service and support; integrated solutions; brand 
6

awareness and reputation; affordability; and product scalability. With respect to the first four factors, we plan to invest in upgrading our product, customer support and user experience during 2017 to help us compete favorably in these areas in the future. With respect to brand awareness in our web presence segment, a trend among consumers to search for web presence and marketing solutions using brand-related search terms rather than generic search terms has favored competitors who have invested more heavily in brand awareness than we have. To address this, we plan to increase our investment in brand awareness in 2017, although these efforts may not be successful. See "Risk Factors" for additional discussion of competition and brand awareness risks we face. 
Seasonality 
Our web presence segment has historically experienced increased subscriber billings in the first quarter of our fiscal year as many subscribers start businesses at the beginning of a new year. This segment records a significant portion of these billings as deferred revenue and recognize the deferred revenue throughout the course of the year and beyond based on the term of the applicable subscription. Consequently, our web presence quarterly subscriber billings and net new subscriber additions are typically relatively high in the first quarter of our fiscal year, while revenue under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") from new web presence subscriber additions is relatively higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. 
Sales within our email marketing segment are also are impacted by seasonality, since SMBs and other small organizations are typically less active during the summer months than at the beginning and end of a year. 
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies, confidential information, brands and other intellectual property. 
We use open source technologies pursuant to applicable licenses as the basis for our technology platform. We have also developed, acquired or licensed proprietary technologies for use in our business. As of January 24, 2017, we have fifteen U.S. patents as well as five pending U.S. patent applications and several pending foreign counterpart applications relating to aspects of our technology platform and offerings, including our shared services architecture, predictive analytics methods, virtualization technologies, subscriber migration technologies, web presence improvement technologies, and email composition and editing technologies. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of the technologies they cover. 
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some unregistered trademarks that were established over years of use. In addition, we have a trademark and service mark enforcement program pursuant to which we monitor applications filed by third parties to register trademarks and service marks that may be confusingly similar to ours, as well as the use of our major brand names in social media, domain names and other Internet sites. 
We have non-disclosure, confidentiality and license agreements with employees, contractors, subscribers and other third parties, which limit access to and use of our proprietary information; however, unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information or proprietary technologies by our employees or third parties could still occur. In addition, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain access to our proprietary rights. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as we expand outside of the United States. 
Third-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap across industries. Third parties, including non-practicing patent holders, have claimed, and could claim in the future, that our processes, technologies or websites infringe patents they now hold or might obtain or that might be issued in the future. See “Risk Factors" for additional discussion about the substantial costs that we could incur as a result of any claim of infringement of another party’s intellectual property rights.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 4,005 employees, including 2,228 in support and network operations, 830 in sales and marketing, 520 in engineering and development, and 427 in general and administrative. Excluded from our employee figures are approximately 790 individuals located in India who are directly employed by a third party, but who are devoted to Endurance on a full time basis and perform a range of services, including email- and chat-based customer and technical 
7

support, billing support, compliance monitoring, domain registrar support, marketing support, network monitoring, engineering and development support and web design and web building services. Most of our employees are based in the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Corporate Information
Our business was founded in 1997 as a Delaware corporation under the name Innovative Marketing Technologies Incorporated. In December 2011, investment funds and entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman, Sachs & Co. acquired a controlling interest in our company. Prior to our initial public offering, or IPO, in October 2013, we were an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of WP Expedition Topco L.P., a Delaware limited partnership that we refer to as WP Expedition Topco. Pursuant to the terms of a corporate reorganization that we completed prior to our IPO, WP Expedition Topco dissolved and in liquidation distributed the shares of Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. common stock to its partners in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of WP Expedition Topco. 
Our principal executive offices are located at 10 Corporate Drive, Suite 300, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803 and our telephone number at that address is (781) 852-3200.
