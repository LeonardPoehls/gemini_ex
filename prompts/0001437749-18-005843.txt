Item 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
AG&E Holdings Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary American Gaming & Electronics, Inc. (“AG&E”) distributes parts and repairs and services gaming equipment to casinos throughout the United States with offices in Las Vegas, Nevada, West Palm Beach, Florida and Hammonton, New Jersey. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” mean AG&E Holdings Inc., an Illinois corporation, and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates a different meaning, and the term “common stock” means our common stock, $1.00 par value per share.
 
Originally founded in 1925 as an Illinois corporation with the name Wells-Gardner Electronics Corporation, the Company previously was a global distributor and manufacturer of liquid crystal display (LCD) video monitors and other related parts for a variety of markets including, but not limited to, gaming machine manufacturers, coin-operated video game manufacturers and other display integrators. On September 12, 2014, the Company sold its LCD monitor business operations, and on October 30, 2014, changed its name to AG&E Holdings Inc. On June 15, 2015, the Company’s distribution agreement for video gaming terminals, or VGTs, in Illinois with GTech expired and as a result, the Company wound down this business.
 
On November 30, 2016, the Company acquired Advanced Gaming Associates LLC (“AGA”). On the closing date, AGA was merged with and into AG&E. The separate legal existence of AGA ceased with AG&E continuing as the surviving entity and remaining a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
