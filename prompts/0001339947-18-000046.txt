Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW
Viacom creates entertainment experiences that drive conversation and culture around the world. Through television, film, digital media, live events, merchandise and solutions, our brands connect with diverse, young and young at heart audiences in more than 180 countries. We operate through two reportable segments: Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment, each of which is described below.
In fiscal year 2018, we executed against three strategic priorities: 

• | First, we are driving share and margins in our core business. We are focused on increasing our share of viewership in our core domestic and international media networks business as well as in Paramount’s film and television production divisions.


◦ | In our Media Networks business, we have designated key “flagship” brands - Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central and Paramount Network - as our highest priority brands. Our flagship brands are unique from our other brands, in that they have compelling, valuable and distinct brand propositions; serve diverse, substantial audiences with content largely owned by us; and have global reach and multi-platform distribution potential across linear, digital, film, consumer products, and live events and experiences. We continue to pursue opportunities to bring the best of Paramount Pictures to our Media Networks business, and the best of our Media Networks business to Paramount Pictures, as part of our efforts to enhance cross-company collaboration.


◦ | In our Filmed Entertainment business, we are focused on developing films designed to appeal specifically to a targeted audience or to broad audiences, with appropriate budgets and revenue projections. We also continue to focus on creatively and efficiently managing our distribution and marketing costs. Paramount’s resurgence is evident in its box office success, thriving television production business, and seven straight quarters of year-over-year adjusted operating income improvement. 


◦ | During 2018, we launched a program of cost transformation initiatives to improve our margins, including an organizational realignment of support functions across Media Networks, new sourcing and procurement policies, real estate consolidation and technology enhancements. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the restructuring and related costs associated with the cost transformation initiatives.


• | Second, we are transitioning to next-generation platforms and marketing solutions. We are packaging and monetizing our content across mobile, social, over-the-top (“OTT”) and other platforms, and via multiple business models, including ad-supported, free and authenticated owned-and-operated apps, direct-to-consumer standalone and bundled subscription services, and product and content-based transactional offerings. We have also developed, and continue to expand, an advanced advertising, data marketing and brand solutions business.


• | Third, we are diversifying beyond our core business. We are extending the reach of our brands in the physical world through consumer products, live events, recreation and other similar experiences. In 2018, we launched a global consumer products group to manage our consumer products business across the Company, with oversight over product and business development, licensing, merchandising, retail sales and marketing. We have also launched a global, cross-portfolio Media Networks studio production initiative with the aim of leveraging our considerable intellectual property library to produce new, first-run, episodic content for third-party distributors. 

We were organized as a Delaware corporation in 2005 in connection with our separation from CBS Corporation (“CBS”), which was effective January 1, 2006. Our principal offices are located at 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036. Our telephone number is (212) 258-6000 and our website is www.viacom.com.

In August 2018, we launched Viacom Digital Studios International (“VDSI”) with a focus on creating, distributing and monetizing digital content for our flagship brands outside of the U.S. VDSI currently has three production hubs, in New York City, Buenos Aires and London.

Our Media Networks segment generates revenues in three categories: (i) the sale of advertising and marketing services, (ii) affiliate fees from distributors of our programming and program services and (iii) ancillary activities such as consumer products. In fiscal year 2018, advertising revenues, affiliate revenues and ancillary revenues were approximately 47%, 46% and 7%, respectively, of total revenues for the Media Networks segment.
Revenues from the Media Networks segment accounted for 77%, 76% and 79% of our revenues for the fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, after the elimination of intercompany revenues.

Advertising Revenues
Our Media Networks segment generates revenues from the sale of advertising and from marketing services. Our advertising revenues generally depend on the number of viewers and viewership demographics. Demand and pricing for our advertising depend on the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers, viewership and overall market conditions.
Ratings and demographic information for advertising purposes are determined by third-party research companies such as Nielsen and comScore, sometimes also including third- and first-party data.
Our Media Networks properties appeal to various key audiences attractive to advertisers. For example, MTV appeals to young adults, Nickelodeon appeals to kids and their families and BET appeals to African-American audiences. We also drive additional demand for our advertising services through integrated sales of multi-platform advertising and marketing opportunities and through our integrated marketing services, providing unique branded content and custom sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers. 
Domestically, we sell a certain amount of our advertising inventory in advance each year in the upfront market, and other inventory in the scatter market closer to the time a program airs. Upfront sales and pricing for each new cable broadcast year are largely established in our third fiscal quarter and reflected in advertising revenue principally beginning in the first quarter of our subsequent fiscal year as marketing plans are finalized and orders are fulfilled to deliver advertising across various programs and dayparts. Pricing for advertising within our programming is generally established based on projected impression delivery, which may be guaranteed on a fixed price per impression unit basis. For advertising sold based on impression guarantees, audience deficiency may result in an obligation to deliver subsequent additional units, thereby reducing inventory available for scatter sales. Scatter advertising is sold throughout the year at pricing reflecting market conditions at the time of sale and customization of services delivered. Most scatter advertising is sold based on impression guarantees. To the extent we do not satisfy contracted impression delivery, we record deferred revenue until such time that the impression guarantee has been satisfied.
Internationally, advertising markets vary by jurisdiction; however, we do not typically sell our inventory in advance in an upfront market. The majority of our international inventory is sold in the equivalent of the U.S. scatter market, and in a number of markets we are represented by third-party sales houses. The terms of these relationships vary. For example, in the UK, which is our largest market outside the U.S., we are represented by a third party to whom we sell the inventory on our television channels in the form of commercial impacts at a price calculated in accordance with a pre-arranged pricing metric, and the third party then resells those impacts to UK agencies and advertisers. In Argentina, our inventory is sold to advertisers either directly or through advertising agencies.
We continue to expand our product offerings to enable our customers and partners to better target and more broadly activate their advertising campaigns. Our Advanced Marketing Solutions portfolio consists of two main categories - Addressable Video and Brand Solutions. 
Addressable Video consists of pools of inventory that we are aggregating and enabling within both multichannel video programming distributor (“MVPD”) and OTT environments, to allow for advanced targeting to fulfill the demand for next generation video ad products. This inventory generally resides in 1) our owned and operated websites and apps, which are distributed either on a stand-alone basis, or via connected device platforms such as Roku, Amazon Fire, or AppleTV; 2) MVPD apps, which are controlled by our distribution partners, who license Viacom content into their platforms and grant us ad insertion rights; or 3) advanced set top boxes, where addressable units are trafficked through the set-top box infrastructure against video-on-demand and live linear television feeds.
Our Viacom Vantage platform combines data from multiple sources, which may include both first- and third-party data, in a predictive environment to deliver enhanced consumer targeting and campaign measurement. In addition, we license our proprietary targeting and data science software underpinning Vantage to third parties to enable them to engage in linear optimization across their networks.
Brand Solutions consists of a bundle of consulting, creative services, and media activation, under four different product types: 1) Influencer Marketing, an end-to-end creative product distributed across social platforms and optimized for the mobile platform, which we take to market under the recently acquired WhoSay brand; 2) Shopper Marketing, which leverages Viacom’s intellectual property and extends reach to physical stores, providing Viacom access to trade and promotion budgets; 3) Branded Programming, which offers advertisers a range of executions, from off the shelf sponsorship of our digital-first productions, to custom content, sometimes taking the form of an original custom series underwritten by an advertiser; and 4) 
11

Experiential, which began with the BET Experience and has now grown to include several other properties including Comedy Central’s Clusterfest, Nickelodeon’s Slimefest and the recently acquired VidCon.
Our consortium with Fox Networks Group, NBCU, Turner and Univision - OpenAP - is the television industry’s first open platform for cross-publisher audience targeting. OpenAP enables advertisers and agencies to define and customize the audiences they want to reach beyond traditional age/gender segments, across member networks, with consistent standards of measurement and independent third-party posting for advertising campaigns. 
Our advertising revenues may be affected by the strength of advertising markets and general economic conditions, and may fluctuate depending on the success of our programming, as measured by viewership, at any given time. Measured viewership may vary based on the success of our programming (due to, among other things, the timing of new episodes related to our popular programming and the performance of competing programs and other entertainment alternatives), the platforms on which our programming is available, and variations related to the methods used by third parties to measure viewership. Advertising revenues may also fluctuate due to the timing of holidays and significant programming events such as awards shows and premieres. Typically, advertising revenues are highest in the first quarter of our fiscal year.
Affiliate Revenues
Our affiliate revenues are generated through fees from distributors of our programming and program services, such as cable television operators, direct-to-home satellite television operators, mobile networks and SVOD and other OTT services.
Our agreements with multichannel television service providers are generally multi-year carriage agreements with set rate increases. The amount of fees we receive is generally a function of the number of subscribers and the rates we receive per subscriber. Expirations of these affiliate agreements are staggered. 
Under SVOD and other similar OTT agreements, we make certain programs available for distribution on one or more dates, and our revenue under these OTT agreements is recognized when the content has been delivered by us and is available for use by the licensee; therefore, revenue will fluctuate depending on the timing of when programming is delivered and made available throughout the license period. 
Ancillary Revenues
Our Media Networks ancillary revenues are principally derived from (i) our consumer products activities, which include licensing our brands and intellectual property, as well as creation and publishing of interactive games across various platforms (including mobile devices, PCs and consoles), (ii) recreation experiences and live events, (iii) viewing of our programming on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (“TVOD”) and through electronic sell-through services and the sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs and (iv) television syndication of our content. 
Our ancillary revenues vary based on consumer spending, the popularity of our programming and intellectual property, and the volume of content available during a particular period. 
Media Networks Competition
Our media networks generally compete with other widely distributed cable networks, broadcast television networks and digital programming services and platforms. Our media networks compete for advertising revenue with other cable and broadcast television networks, social media platforms, other connected outlets such as websites, apps and other online experiences, radio programming and print media. Each programming service competes for audience share with other programming services that target or include the same audience. For example, Nickelodeon’s programming and services compete for younger viewers, and BET’s programming and services compete for consumers of African-American culture, with other entertainment services, including cable and broadcast networks, digital distribution outlets and other content platforms. We also compete with other cable networks for affiliate fees and distribution. Our networks compete with other content creators for directors, actors, writers, producers and other creative talent and for new program ideas and the acquisition of popular programming. Competition from these sources may affect our revenues and costs.

FILMED ENTERTAINMENT
Overview
Our Filmed Entertainment segment develops, produces, finances, acquires and distributes films, television programming and other entertainment content through its Paramount Pictures®, Paramount PlayersTM, Paramount Animation® and Paramount TelevisionTM divisions, in various markets and media worldwide. It partners on various projects with key Viacom brands, including Nickelodeon Movies, MTV Films and BET Films.
Films produced, acquired and/or distributed by the Filmed Entertainment segment are generally first exhibited theatrically in domestic and/or international markets and then released in various markets through airlines and hotels, electronic sell-through, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, TVOD, pay television, SVOD, cable and free television. In fiscal year 2018, the Filmed Entertainment segment released 9 films theatrically, including Mission: Impossible - Fallout, A Quiet Place, Daddy’s Home 2 and Book Club. 

Paramount Pictures is a major global producer and distributor of filmed entertainment and has an extensive library consisting of approximately 1,200 film titles produced by Paramount, acquired rights to approximately 2,200 additional films and a number of television programs. Paramount’s library includes many Academy Award winners, including Titanic, Braveheart, Forrest Gump, The Godfather, The Godfather Part II and Wings, which won the first Academy Award ever awarded for Best Picture in 1929, and other Academy Award Best Picture nominees such as Arrival, Fences, The Big Short, Selma and The Wolf of Wall Street. The Paramount library also includes classics such as The Ten Commandments, Breakfast at Tiffany’s and Sunset Boulevard and a number of successful franchises such as Mission: Impossible, Transformers, Star Trek and Paranormal Activity. 

Paramount Players aims to expand Paramount’s slate of films by partnering with our Media Networks flagship brands to develop, produce and release distinctive feature films in order to bring more of our leading brands to movie audiences around the world. These co-branded films are distributed by Paramount with a unique emphasis on marketing campaigns and integrations benefiting from the global reach of our flagship networks. Paramount Players also focuses on smaller budget films for specific genres and target audiences. Nobody’s Fool, Tyler Perry’s first feature film with Paramount Players and BET Films, was released in November 2018, and Paramount Players expects to theatrically release three additional films in fiscal year 2019, including What Men Want and Dora the Explorer, a live-action adaption of the classic Nickelodeon series that is being co-produced with Nickelodeon Movies.
Paramount Animation
Paramount Animation creates high-quality animated films and aims to release one to two titles per year. Upcoming releases include Wonder Park, a film about the adventures of a young girl in a magical amusement park, expected to be released in 2019, and Spongebob 3 and Monster on the Hill, both expected to be released in 2020. We anticipate that Wonder Park will be followed by a Wonder Park television series on Nickelodeon. 
13


Paramount Television develops and finances a wide range of original, premium television content across all types of media platforms for distribution worldwide. Paramount Television’s productions include The Alienist for TNT, Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan for Amazon, 13 Reasons Why and Maniac for Netflix and Berlin Station and The Contender for EPIX. Paramount Television’s fiscal year 2019 slate includes The Haunting of Hill House for Netflix, Catch-22 for Hulu, Boomerang for BET and First Wives Club for Paramount Network. In 2018, Paramount Television’s programming received nine Emmy Award nominations. 
Film Production, Distribution and Financing
Paramount produces many of the films it releases and also acquires films for distribution from third parties. In some cases, Paramount co-finances and/or co-distributes films with third parties, including other studios. Paramount also enters into film-specific financing and slate financing arrangements from time to time under which third parties participate in the financing of the costs of a film or group of films, typically in exchange for a partial copyright interest. Paramount distributes films worldwide or in select territories or media, and may engage third-party distributors for certain pictures in certain territories.
Paramount has several multi-picture production, distribution and financing relationships, including its recently extended agreement with Skydance Productions (“Skydance”) and a new overall deal with Hasbro Inc. (“Hasbro”). Under the Skydance agreement, Paramount and Skydance will continue to work together to produce and finance certain Paramount films, and Paramount has a first look on Skydance-initiated projects, including animated films. Paramount’s agreement with Hasbro involves the production, financing and distribution of live action and animated films based on Hasbro’s expansive list of properties. Paramount and Hasbro will also continue to work together on the Transformers and G.I. Joe franchises, including the first Transformers spinoff - Bumblebee - which is scheduled for theatrical release in December 2018. 
Domestically, Paramount generally performs marketing and distribution services for theatrical releases and sales and marketing services for its home entertainment releases. Paramount has an agreement with Universal Studios for certain back-office and distribution services for all physical DVD and Blu-ray discs released by Paramount in the U.S. and Canada. Paramount also distributes CBS’s television and other library content on DVD and Blu-ray disc on a worldwide basis under an agreement that runs through 2020.
Internationally, Paramount generally distributes its theatrical releases through its own international affiliates or, in territories where it does not have an operating presence, through United International Pictures, a joint venture with Universal Studios, or third-party distributors. For home entertainment releases, Paramount’s physical DVD and Blu-ray discs are distributed in certain international territories by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and in certain other territories by Paramount licensees. 
Paramount also distributes films domestically and internationally on electronic sell-through, TVOD, SVOD and television platforms. In the first domestic pay television distribution window, Paramount’s feature films initially theatrically released in the U.S. are generally exhibited on EPIX, a multi-platform premium entertainment service. 
Producing, marketing and distributing films and television programming can involve significant costs, and the timing of a film’s release can cause our financial results to vary. For example, marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows, and are expensed as incurred. As a result, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film’s theatrical exhibition, and recoupment of investment as well as profitability for the film may not be realized until well after its theatrical release. Therefore, the results of the Filmed Entertainment segment can be volatile as films work their way through the various distribution windows.
Filmed Entertainment Revenues
Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenues in four categories: (i) the release and/or distribution of films theatrically, (ii) the release and/or distribution of film and television product through home entertainment, (iii) the licensing of film and television product to television and digital platforms and (iv) other ancillary activities. In fiscal year 2018, theatrical revenues, home entertainment revenues, licensing revenues and ancillary revenues were approximately 23%, 20%, 50% and 7%, respectively, of total revenues for the Filmed Entertainment segment.
14

Revenues from the Filmed Entertainment segment accounted for 23%, 24% and 21% of our revenues for the fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, after the elimination of intercompany revenues.
Theatrical Revenues
Paramount generates revenues worldwide from the theatrical distribution of films, primarily from audience ticket sales, including 3D and/or IMAX tickets that are generally sold at premium pricing. Our theatrical release strategy generally aims to develop films designed to appeal specifically to a targeted audience or to broad audiences, with appropriate budgets and projected revenue. 
Each film is a separate and distinct product with its revenues, and ultimate profitability, dependent upon many factors, among which domestic and international audience response is of fundamental importance. Theatrical revenues may also be affected by the number, timing and mix of releases and competitive offerings in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, and overall economic conditions, including trends in discretionary spending. The theatrical success of a film is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment markets and licensing arrangements for television and other platforms. Revenues from theatrical film releases tend to be cyclical with increases in the summer months during our fourth quarter. 
In fiscal year 2018, Paramount theatrically released in domestic and/or international markets Mission: Impossible - Fallout, A Quiet Place, Daddy’s Home 2, Book Club, Sherlock Gnomes, Annihilation, Downsizing, Action Point, Same Kind of Different as Me and Suburbicon. In addition to Nobody’s Fool and Overlord, which were released in November 2018, Paramount’s fiscal year 2019 slate is expected to include Instant Family, Bumblebee, What Men Want, Wonder Park, Pet Sematary, Rocketman and Dora the Explorer. 
Home Entertainment Revenues
Home entertainment revenues are derived from the worldwide sales and distribution of DVDs and Blu-ray discs relating to the films released theatrically by Paramount and programming of other Viacom brands such as Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and BET, as well as certain acquired films and content distributed on behalf of third parties such as CBS. Home entertainment revenues are also derived from the viewing of our films on a transactional basis through TVOD and electronic sell-through services around the world, for a fee and/or on a revenue-sharing basis.
Our home entertainment revenues may be affected by the number, timing and mix of releases and competitive offerings in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, the prominence given by distributors and retailers to our releases compared to those of our competitors, and overall economic conditions, including trends in discretionary spending.
Key home entertainment releases in fiscal year 2018 included Daddy’s Home 2 and A Quiet Place. 
Licensing Revenues
Paramount generates fees by licensing, around the world on a territory-by-territory basis, films and television programs produced, acquired or distributed by Paramount, for a fee or on a revenue-sharing basis, to SVOD, pay and basic cable television, free television and free video-on-demand services.
Revenue from the licensing of film and television exhibition rights is recognized upon availability for airing by the licensee and will fluctuate depending on the number and mix of available titles in any given territory.
Licensing revenues in fiscal year 2018 were generated from licensing of films, including The Cloverfield Paradox, Transformers: The Last Knight, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, Daddy’s Home 2, Daddy’s Home and Baywatch, and from distribution of Paramount Television titles, including Jack Ryan, 13 Reasons Why, The Alienist, Shooter and Berlin Station. 
Ancillary Revenues
Paramount generates ancillary revenues by providing production and facilities services to third parties, primarily at Paramount’s studio lot. Paramount also generates ancillary revenues by licensing its brands for consumer products, themed restaurants, hotels and resorts, live stage plays, film clips and theme parks and other location-based entertainment projects.
15

Filmed Entertainment Competition
Our Filmed Entertainment segment’s competitive position primarily depends on the amount and quality of the content it produces, its distribution and marketing success and public response. It competes for audiences for its films, television programming and other entertainment content with releases by other major film studios, television producers and OTT services. It also competes with other forms of entertainment and consumer spending outlets. We also compete for creative talent, including producers, actors, directors and writers, and new film and television projects, all of which are essential to our success. Our film brands also compete with studios and other producers of entertainment content for distribution on third-party platforms. Competition from these sources may affect our revenues and costs.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Viacommunity is the global umbrella covering all of Viacom’s social impact and purpose-driven initiatives. By leveraging Viacom’s culture of diversity and creativity, Viacommunity offers programs that empower, engage and inspire our employees, audiences and company to make a difference in the global communities we serve.
Following are just a few examples of our efforts: 

Viacommunity Day, our global day of service, offers over 100 opportunities for thousands of employees across Viacom, in 25 countries, to join together to volunteer in our communities each year. From beautifying local parks to mentoring youth in schools to assembling kits for those in need and promoting many other types of volunteer activities, Viacommunity Day has long been a tradition for Viacom employees, celebrating its 22nd year in 2018.

In partnership with Viacom, Get Schooled leverages the power of pop culture to inspire and empower students to graduate from high school and succeed in college. Get Schooled partners with over 2,000 middle and high schools, and engages close to two million students, nationwide and has been recognized by Fast Company as a “Most Innovative Company.”

The VH1 Save The Music Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to restoring instrumental music education programs in America’s public schools, and raising awareness about the importance of music as part of each child’s complete education. Founded in 1997, VH1 Save The Music has donated more than $56 million worth of new musical instruments to 2,100 public schools in 261 school districts around the country, impacting the lives of more than three million public school students.

Nickelodeon encourages kids to get up and get active on its annual Worldwide Day of Play by suspending programming for three hours in the afternoon across its platforms while thousands of local partners nationwide host activities focused on “just” playing. The Road to Worldwide Day of Play campaign, underway throughout each summer, travels to communities where kids are hometown heroes making play happen.

Paramount has a long and proud tradition of giving back with a corporate social responsibility program focused on four key initiatives: supporting public education; protecting the environment; combating HIV/AIDS; and promoting volunteerism. By offering employee engagement opportunities, coupled with financial and in-kind contributions, Paramount supports numerous local, national, and global non-profit organizations. Kindergarten to Cap & Gown - Paramount’s signature education program - mentors students through their educational experience, targeting four partner schools in Paramount’s Los Angeles neighborhood.

Talent for Good, our skills-based employee volunteering program, leverages the knowledge and power of Viacom’s workforce to assist organizations striving to impact social change. In partnership with Catchafire (a nonprofit skills-based volunteer matching service), the program offers employees the opportunity to hone their skills and forge lasting relationships both across Viacom and with local organizations, while giving back to worthy causes. To date, Talent for Good has engaged more than 700 Viacom employees domestically and assisted many nonprofit organizations across the U.S.

In August 2018, Paramount Network launched its first-ever Stories Matter - Storytelling Lab initiative, which aims to install filmmaking and editing equipment in schools across underrepresented communities in the U.S. Paramount Network plans to bring the best of the Storytelling Lab stories to its audiences, online and on television, to amplify these untold stories.

VIMN’s multi-award-winning MTV Staying Alive Foundation engages in fighting the stigma, spread and threat of the HIV and AIDS epidemic globally by creating engaging media content such as MTV Shuga and funding youth-led, grassroots prevention projects.

MTV’s Emmy Award-winning “Look Different” campaign helps America’s youth better recognize and challenge hidden racial, gender and anti-LGBT biases, empowering them to create a more equal future.
REGULATION AND PROTECTION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We are, fundamentally, a media content company, so the trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property laws that protect our brands and entertainment content are of paramount importance to us. Our businesses and the intellectual property they create or acquire are subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as laws and regulations of countries other than the U.S. and pan-national bodies such as the European Union 
17

(“EU”). The laws and regulations affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change as are the protections that those laws and regulations afford us. The discussion below describes certain, but not all, present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.
Certain Regulations Affecting Our Business
Children’s Programming 
Our business is subject to various regulations, both in the U.S. and abroad, applicable to children’s programming. Since 1990, federal legislation and rules of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) have limited the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and since 2006 the FCC has limited the display of certain commercial website addresses during children’s programming. In July 2018, the FCC initiated rulemaking to revise its children’s programming rules. We are participating in that process. In addition, some policymakers have sought limitations on food and beverage marketing in media popular with children and teens. For example, restrictions on the television advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (“HFSS”) to children aged 15 and under have been in place in the UK since 2007. The UK government is currently considering tighter controls, including a ban on all HFSS advertising before 9:00 p.m. Various laws with similar objectives have also been enacted in Ireland, Turkey, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Taiwan and South Korea, and significant pressure for similar restrictions continues to be felt globally, most acutely in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, India, Slovenia, South Africa and France. The implementation of these or similar limitations and restrictions could have a negative impact on our Media Networks advertising revenues, particularly for our networks with programming for children and teens.
Global Data Protection Laws and Children’s Privacy Laws
A number of data protection laws impact, or may impact, the manner in which Viacom collects, processes and transfers personal data. Most notably, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which went into effect in May 2018, expands data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significantly increased fines for noncompliance, requiring additional compliance resources and efforts on our part. Further, a number of other regions where we do business, including the U.S., Asia, and Latin America, have enacted or are considering new data protection regulations that may impact our business activities that involve the processing of personal data. In addition, some of the mechanisms Viacom relies upon for the transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S., such as utilizing standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission (“EC”), have been subject to legal challenges, and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, which permits the transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S., is subject to review by the relevant EU and U.S. authorities. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain and may require changes to our international data transfer mechanisms. 
In addition, we are subject to other laws and regulations intended specifically to protect the interests of children, including the privacy of minors online. The U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) limits the collection by operators of websites or online services of personal information online from children under 13 years of age. In addition to COPPA, the EU’s GDPR also limits our ability to process data from children under the age of 16. We have been required to limit some functionality on our websites and apps as a result of these regulations. Such regulations also restrict the types of advertising we are able to sell on these sites and apps and impose strict liability on us for certain actions of Viacom, advertisers and other third parties, which could affect advertising demand and pricing. State and federal policymakers are also considering regulatory and legislative methods to protect consumer privacy on the Internet, and these efforts have focused particular attention on children and teens. 
Compliance with enhanced data protection laws requires additional resources and efforts on our part, and noncompliance with personal data protection regulations could result in increased regulatory enforcement and significant monetary fines.
EU Commission’s Digital Single Market Strategy 
The EC continues to pursue its Digital Single Market (“DSM”) Strategy, which contains a broad range of proposals designed to create a more complete EU-wide market for digital goods and services, several of which are likely to impact Viacom’s businesses. The territorial nature of copyright has been identified by the EC as one of the main barriers to a single European market, and there has been strong pressure from politicians to undermine content owners’ commercial freedom to distribute exclusively on a territorial basis.
The EC published DSM-related legislative proposals in each of May 2016 and September 2016. Several of these proposals are of particular relevance to Viacom’s business practices in Europe given their impact on content owners’ exclusive control over distribution decisions for film and television productions. In June 2017, the Portability Regulation went into effect, requiring 
18

online content providers to ensure that their subscribers can access content while temporarily in another EU country. Another regulation currently under consideration by the EU Parliament and Council seeks to extend the EU Satellite and Cable Directive to permit EU-wide licenses for rights included in broadcasters’ online ancillary services, with the aim of making it easier for platforms to respond to passive sales requests for those services from other EU countries without contravening copyright law. A further proposal would entitle talent to seek additional non-contractual compensation through the courts for highly-successful works, which would raise our operating expenses.
The EC has adopted a number of reforms to the Audio-Visual Media Services Directive, which sets content and advertising rules for European broadcasters. The revised Directive is expected to become effective at the end of 2018, followed by a 21-month implementation period for states to adopt the regulations at the national level. A liberalization of advertising minutage restrictions on linear channels could cause shifts of advertising spending between broadcasters with an adverse impact on some of our international channels in certain EU countries. In addition, changes to the operation of the ‘country of origin’ rule, which allows pan-EU broadcasters to be regulated in a single EU jurisdiction, could increase scrutiny of our licensing location decisions, and allow countries to impose levies on services licensed outside of their jurisdiction.
Restrictions on Content Distribution 
In addition to the regulations regarding territorial licensing in the EU discussed above, numerous countries around the world impose restrictions on the amount and nature of content that may be distributed in that country. 
Such regulations in China have the greatest impact, as only 34 foreign films, as selected by relevant authorities in China, may be distributed annually on a revenue share basis based on box office performance. In addition, in September 2018, China’s film and television regulator, the National Administration of TV and Radio, published proposed regulations that would severely limit the streaming and broadcasting of foreign film and television content in China, further reducing foreign access to the Chinese market. 
UK Regulations Affecting Channel 5 Business 
As a PSB in the UK, Channel 5 is subject to certain OFCOM broadcasting regulations that impose detailed obligations including mandating the proportion of total programming and programming during peak hours that must be original productions; the hours devoted to news and current affairs; and the proportion of commissioned programming that must be made by independent producers. Channel 5 has also undertaken to air a certain amount of UK-originated children’s programming. Like all UK broadcasters, Channel 5 must abide by the OFCOM Broadcasting Code, which contains content and scheduling regulations relating to harm and offense, protection of individuals under the age of 18, privacy, fairness and product placement, and by OFCOM’s Code on the Scheduling of Television Advertising, which contains regulations on the amount and scheduling of advertising.
Program Access 
Under the U.S. Communications Act of 1934, as amended, vertically integrated cable programmers are generally prohibited from entering into exclusive distribution arrangements or offering different prices, terms or conditions to competing MVPDs unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the regulations promulgated by the FCC. Our wholly-owned program services are not currently subject to these program access rules. Because we and CBS are under common control, each company’s businesses, as well as the businesses of any other commonly controlled company, may be attributable to the other companies for purposes of the program access rules, and therefore the businesses and conduct of CBS could have the effect of making us subject to the rules. If Viacom or its programming agreements were to become subject to the program access rules, our flexibility to negotiate the most favorable terms available for our content and our ability to offer cable television operators exclusive programming could be adversely affected.
Protecting our Content from Copyright Theft 
The unauthorized reproduction, distribution, exhibition or other exploitation of copyrighted material interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to distribute and monetize our content. The theft of films, television and other entertainment content presents a significant challenge to our industry, and we take a number of steps to address this concern. Where possible, we make use of technological protection tools, such as encryption, to protect our content. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, including: monitoring online destinations that distribute or otherwise infringe our content and sending takedown or cease and desist notices in appropriate circumstances; using filtering technologies employed by some user-generated content sites; and pursuing litigation and referrals to law enforcement with respect to websites and other online platforms that distribute or facilitate the distribution and exploitation of 
19

our content without authorization. Through partnerships with various organizations, we also are actively involved in educational outreach to the creative community, labor unions, state and federal government officials and other stake holders in an effort to marshal greater resources to combat copyright theft. Additionally, we participate in various industry-wide enforcement initiatives, public relations programs and legislative activities on a worldwide basis. We have had notable success with site-blocking efforts in Europe and Asia, which can be effective in diverting consumers from piracy platforms to legitimate platforms.
Notwithstanding these efforts and the many legal protections that exist to combat piracy, the proliferation of content theft and technological tools with which to carry it out continue to be a challenge. The failure to maintain enhanced legal protections and enforcement tools and to update those tools as threats evolve could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could negatively impact its value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights as we continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
We create, own and distribute intellectual property worldwide. It is our practice to protect our films, programs, content, brands, formats, characters, games, publications and other original and acquired works, and ancillary goods and services. The following brands, logos, trade names, trademarks and related trademark families are a few of those strongly identified with the product lines they represent and are significant assets of the Company: Viacom®, Nickelodeon®, Nick Jr.®, MTV®, BET®, Comedy Central®, Paramount Network®, Nick at Nite®, Nicktoons®, TeenNick®, MTV2®, MTV Classic®, VH1®, CMT®, TV Land®, Logo®, Channel 5® (UK), Milkshake!TM, Telefe® (Argentina), Colors®, SPIKE®, Paramount Channel™, MTV LiveTM, BET Networks®, BET HerTM, BET Gospel®, BET Hip Hop®, Tr3s®, Paramount Pictures®, Paramount Players™, Paramount Animation®, Paramount Television™, Paramount Vantage®, Paramount Classics®, Insurge Pictures®, MTV Films®, Nickelodeon Movies™, SLIME®, AwesomenessTV®, WhoSay®, VidCon®, Viacom Digital Studios™, Viacom Vantage™, Viacom Velocity™ and other domestic and international program services and digital properties. 
EMPLOYEES AND LABOR MATTERS
As of September 30, 2018, we employed approximately 10,400 full-time and part-time employees worldwide, and had approximately 960 additional project-based staff on our payroll. We also use many other temporary employees in the ordinary course of our business.
Our Filmed Entertainment segment, through in-house, affiliated and third-party production service companies, engages the services of writers, directors, performers, musicians and various crew members who are subject to certain industry-wide and/or specially negotiated collective bargaining agreements. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers is a multi-employer trade association, which, along with and on behalf of hundreds of member companies including Paramount Pictures, negotiates the industry-wide collective bargaining agreements with these parties. Certain collective bargaining agreements that apply to specific companies have been negotiated in the past, and we expect will be negotiated as the need arises in the future. 
Our Media Networks segment, through in-house and third-party production service companies, engages for certain of our productions the services of writers, directors, performers, musicians and various crew members who are subject to certain specially negotiated collective bargaining agreements or one-off agreements. Since these agreements are entered into on a per-channel or per-project basis, negotiations occur on various agreements throughout the year. 
Any dispute with the labor organizations that represent any of these parties could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues.
