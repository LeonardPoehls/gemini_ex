ITEM 1. Business
Overview
 
We were incorporated on July 13, 1994 in the State of New York to recruit and provide an array of IT personnel for businesses. Due to the progressive nature of digital services, the Company evolved to provide on-site IT programmers, analysts and architects for corporations, and online services for sales and marketing professionals requiring sales data, marketing intelligence and real-time leads. Historically, our business was a traditional “head hunter” agency which provided on-site IT programmers, analysts and other IT professionals for businesses. In April 2015, we purchased from Green Tree Software LLC a 49% interest in its product called GreenTree Magic Software, which has a database that provides access to information on IT professionals in the industry. In addition to technical qualifications of IT staff for companies included in the database, the software also provides business intelligence that allows companies to find other businesses that may need their services. The database includes contact information, type of technology used, management information and real-time leads that we believe will enable companies to better target their recruiting efforts. As a result of our purchase of the minority interest in the Greentree Magic Software, the Company’s primary business activity during 2016 was marketing the software.  To date, four (4) licenses have been sold.  As a result, we are changing our business focus to not being reliant on sales of the software.
Business
 
Historically, our business was a traditional “head hunter” agency which provided personnel recruitment, programming and IT contingent staff to businesses.  Our clients have included Goldman Sachs, Panasonic, Federal Reserve Bank, and Xpress Scripts.  While our focus during 2016 switched from the provision of traditional placement agency services to development and marketing of software to create a technology based placement agency, commencing in 2017 we expect once again to devote resources to our traditional business of placement services.
 
We have provided the following IT services: (i) Onsite programmers, analysts and architects – recruiting IT personnel for companies either on an hourly basis acting as a consulting firm or as full time employee positions for a one time placement fee acting as a staffing company; (ii) Programming - providing experienced consultants, offering programming languages such as JAVA C++ PHP C# .NET and supplying talent to work alongside the existing staff of a given company, giving technical advice and acumen to compliment and bolster the existing staff; and (iii) Quality Assurance – providing experience quality assurance personal and business analysts in the same companies and clients as our programming staff.
 
Commencing in 2017 we will attempt to expand our customer base and begin providing placement services to non-IT related customers.  Our initial focus will be the provision of personnel in the IT and telecommunications fields and temporary placements in the food industry on a recurring basis.
 
GreenTree Magic Software
 
In connection with our agreement with Green Tree Software LLC described under Green Tree Magic Software Agreement below, we acquired a 49% minority interest of the Green Tree Magic Software and we have, together with Green Tree Software LLC, the exclusive rights to market and distribute the software worldwide. Both Green Tree Software LLC and the Company are expected to make sales of the software for the mutual benefit of both entities, with 51% of net revenues accruing to Green Tree Software LLC and 49% of net revenues accruing to the Company.
 
The software, which was marketed during 2016, provides business intelligence to companies for business development and professional IT recruiting. The software provides access to information for passive IT applicants in the industry. The software provides a searchable list by company of the IT personnel within a company and lists their technical abilities. We believe that this will provide a tool for companies searching for individuals with a particular array of software or hardware expertise. The software also includes contact information, type of technology used, management information, and other useful information that enables companies to better target their IT staffing efforts. Users will have access to work history, educational background, skills, technical abilities and specific accomplishments for various levels of IT professional within our listed companies.
 
We believe that the software will help companies generate sales leads by providing access to actionable triggers, for example, a change in management, use of new software, or the type of programming language used by companies in our database. We also believe that the software will also serve as a business intelligence tool by providing “Strategic Spending Alerts” of businesses throughout the United States, e.g. “Ford Motor Company is opening a new Data Center in Denver Colorado and Ford has allocated $23 million for this project which will require programming and networking personnel”.

The initial version of the software, which is fully developed and being marketed, provides skills and contact information for over 30,000 IT professionals, over 2,000 companies and information with respect to more than 8,000 spending initiatives totaling millions of dollars.
 
Our aim is to assist staffing firms and human resource departments capitalize on this knowledge to find candidates and increase business productivity by licensing to them the GreenTree Magic Software. After licensing the software, clients will be able to create an account. Each license provides access to one account. As an incentive, companies that help us update our database will receive a 5% discount towards their license for the following year. To meet this requirement, clients must provide a minimum of 10 updates. We believe this will increase opportunities to have return clients while keeping our information as current as possible.
 
Our base price for a software license is an annual fee of $8,000, which we believe is approximately 50% less than the prices charged by our main competitors.  To date we have sold four licenses, albeit some at discounted prices.
 
Although Green Tree Software LLC initially developed the software, we and Green Tree collaborated to provide further enhancements and develop, market and sell the software. Our team of researchers is experienced at running searches over the Internet to locate additional data on companies and IT personnel to increase the scope of our coverage and to monitor changes as personnel move from job to job.  In addition, we mine data from external database sources which we subscribe to and the additional information is added to our database by two data entry professional.  To the extent data is added to the database, updates will be available, at no additional cost, to purchasers of a license during the 12 month term of the license.
 
We believe the following to be keys to success of our business: (i) Flexibility to meet the demands of any corporate establishment, regardless of size and requirement; (ii) Expertise and advice to tailor each offering to suit the needs of each client; (iii) Cost effective and competitively priced service; (iv) Excellent user experience with support from knowledgeable and experienced staff; and (v) Partnering and collaboration by outlining common goals and understanding of culture, values and approach, that builds trust and openness, resulting in a shared and transparent partnership.
 
Industry Overview
 
We believe many factors that have contributed to the rise of the IT solutions market, including enterprise mobility and the expanding global mobile worker population. As the mobile workforce needs to remain in touch with its corporate headquarters and have access to business information at all times, the demand for working solutions such as document sharing and web conferencing, need to be available on all platforms. We believe that demand for efficient business continuity will continue to rise, with the necessity of such efficiencies not only limited to huge multinationals but for businesses of all sizes.  We believe that improving economies in the US and elsewhere will generate cash flow to support new hiring initiatives
 
The United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics has stated that employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 12 percent from 2014 to 2024, faster than the average for all occupations. These occupations are expected to add about 488,500 new jobs, from about 3.9 million jobs to about 4.4 million jobs from 2014 to 2024, in part due to a greater emphasis on cloud computing, the collection and storage of big data, more everyday items becoming connected to the Internet in what is commonly referred to as the “Internet of things,” and the continued demand for mobile computing.

Marketing
 
Our initial target market has been the existing B2B sector with which we have existing relationships, meaning our current and past staffing customer relationships. In an effort to expand our network we have contacted prior clients and incentivized them through free trials and below market price licensing fees to try our new technology based services.  By utilizing our software to identify qualified personnel, companies looking to fill an IT position can directly approach potential candidates and hire them without having to pay placement fees to traditional placement agencies.  In addition to the B2B sector, we believe our software will be attractive to traditional placement agencies as a way for them to expand their own databases to increase their ability to locate qualified IT personnel for their clients.  Finally, we believe that at our $8,000 price point, there may be individuals looking to upgrade their positions that would purchase the software to assist in their own job search.

Besides cultivating existing relationships, we plan to engage with businesses and other potential customers through online marketing. To focus our marketing efforts, we plan to segment the market by geography and demographics, such as the location and size of company. Client acquisition is expected to be accomplished through a promotional mix of social network marketing and networking, and by:

· | Building relationships - developing and retaining relationships will convey how we believe that our solutions will provide the ability to reach more consumers at a low cost. We believe that this will also result in referrals to other customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Content Marketing - using targeted and carefully selected content through ad networks, social media and video networks (e.g. YouTube, Website) to develop relationships with clients through “shares” (i.e. sharing our product information and successes through the above media outlets.)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Online advertising - specifically targeted at businesses, using professional networks, such as LinkedIn.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Networking - at major industry conferences and technology events, seeking partners in the industry through the distribution of both on and offline marketing material.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Website - increased SEO and banner promotion, in order to drive more traffic to our website.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Blogs – we intend to develop and support blogs which we expect will be constantly updated in order to keep content fresh.

Competition
 
We believe that Tekmark Global Solutions LLC, a company that offers a range of IT, telecom, financial, consulting and staffing services, Galaxy Systems Inc., a company providing IT consulting and recruiting in the placement industry and Pivotal Solutions, Inc., an IT staffing company of which our former director, Steven Edelman, is the chief executive officer, are staffing solutions competitors and  Rainking Software, Inc., Monster Worldwide, Inc. and DiscoverOrg Inc. are providers of software for IT staffing and business intelligence with which we compete.
 
However, there is no comparable offer currently in the market of which we are aware that provides (i) the full range of personnel at each company from management level all the way down to junior IT staff; and (ii) the depth of information for a passive IT professional candidate (phone, email, place of employment, position, technical skills used in last 5 years).
 
We expected that GreenTree Magic Software would separate itself from the competition through an affordable pricing structure. We initially intended to charge licensing fees at prices below industry standards in order to increase market share and develop brand awareness. In addition to targeting large companies, we believed this would allow us to also target mid-size companies seeking a strategic edge over the competition as well as smaller price-conscious companies, traditional placement agencies and individuals.
 
However, larger companies with greater resources and recognition than us may enter the market which may make competition even more difficult.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company does not have any patents.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to local and international laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations. We are also subject to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of our business. However, to our knowledge, there are no laws or regulations specifically directed to our industry and proposed business activities.  While general laws about privacy are applicable, we only incorporate publicly available data in our databases.
Employees
 
During 2016 we had one full-time employee.  During 2016 there were currently two persons overseas providing Data Entry and Quality Assurance Services at an annual cost of approximately $24,000 of which we are responsible for 49% of the cost with the balance payable by Green Tree Software LLC.

Green Tree Magic Software Agreement
 
On April 27, 2015, we entered into a software purchase agreement with Green Tree Software LLC (“Green Tree”), Steven Edelman, the principal of Green Tree, and Rosenweiss Capital LLC (“Rosenweiss”), pursuant to which we purchased a minority 49% interest in the software known as “Greentree Magic Software” from Green Tree Software LLC for 14,700,000 shares of our common stock to Green Tree, representing 49% of our issued and outstanding shares at that time, and $54,000 in cash.
 
If the software has not generated at least $25,000 in revenues by April 27, 2017, Green Tree Software LLC will return 7,350,000 shares to the treasury of the Company and 7,350,000 shares to Rosenweiss. In such situation, we would retain a 5% interest in the software. As a result of this obligation, Green Tree agreed not to sell or transfer any of the 14,700,000 shares until April 27, 2017 without obtaining certain consents.
 
In anticipation that we would lose our rights to the software in April 2017 since we had not met the revenue milestone, and in an effort to recoup some value for our shareholders, on March 2, 2017, we entered into a Software Sale Agreement with Green Tree Software LLC which provides for us to sell all of our rights and interest in the Greentree Magic Software product for $7,000.  The closing is expected to occur in April. 
 
Growth Strategy
 
Inasmuch as we have been unable to gain traction in the IT sector or generate any significant interest in the software, in the first quarter of 2017 we made the strategic decision to change management and the direction of the company by moving away from a software based business and back to our roots as a traditional placement agency, albeit with a difference focus.  Our current management has contacts in the IT, telecommunications, food service and real estate businesses and we will attempt to grow our business through increased placements in those industries.  In addition, we intend to pursue entry into other markets through a variety of potential sales channels, for example by retaining a call center to initiate contacts with potential customers allowing the Company to make sales to those recipients expressing interest.  Our initial efforts appear to be paying dividends as we signed contracts during the first quarter of 2017 which are expected to generate approximately $25,000 to $50,000 of revenue.
 
In addition to attempting to grow our current business, we believe that there are lateral opportunities to acquire operating businesses. We may consider the possibility of acquiring an operating business if we believe it will enhance shareholder value.  We anticipate that, given our current cash flow levels, any acquisition would likely involve the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or third party financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify and successfully conclude negotiations with any potential target.
