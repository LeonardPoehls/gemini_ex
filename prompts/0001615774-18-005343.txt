In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Barington/Hilco Acquisition Corp.
 
Introduction
 
We are a Delaware blank check company incorporated on July 24, 2014. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses (an “Initial Business Combination”). We have not generated any operating revenues and will not until after completion of our Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We have generated non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”).
Company History 
 
In September 2014, our original sponsors purchased an aggregate of 1,150,000 shares of our common stock, which we refer to throughout this report as the “Insider Shares,” for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.02 per share.


On February 11, 2015, the Company sold 4,000,000 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit in its Initial Public Offering. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Common Stock”), one right (“Public Right”) and one redeemable Common Stock purchase warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Right will convert into one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation of our Initial Business Combination. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $12.50 per whole share.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 295,000 Units (“Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Unit in a private placement to the Company’s original sponsors and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the Company’s underwriters (“EBC”), generating gross proceeds of $2,950,000. On such date, EBC notified the Company of its election to exercise its over-allotment option to the extent of 293,069 out of a possible 600,000 Units. Pursuant to terms set forth upon their purchase, 76,733 Insider Shares held by our original sponsors were forfeited when the underwriters did not exercise their over-allotment option in full.


Of the net proceeds from our Initial Public Offering (including the exercise of the over-allotment option) and the private placement of the Private Units, $43,642,769 was placed in a trust account at Morgan Stanley with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). Except as described in this Form 10-K, the remaining proceeds in the Trust Account will not be released until the earlier of the completion of our Initial Business Combination and our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares of Common Stock upon our failure to consummate an Initial Business Combination by June 30, 2018, or earlier at the Company’s option.


Our Initial Public Offering documents provided that we initially had until August 11, 2016 to complete an Initial Business Combination, with an option to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 24 months to complete a Business Combination). In order to extend the time available for us to consummate a Business Combination, the initial stockholders or their affiliates or designees were required to deposit into the Trust Account $100,000 prior to the applicable deadline for each three month extension. On August 8, 2016, we elected to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination for an additional three months ending on November 11, 2016 and, accordingly, deposited $100,000 into the Trust Account. Subsequently, on November 10, 2016, we elected to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination for an additional three months ending on February 11, 2017 and, accordingly, deposited an additional $100,000 into the Trust Account.

On February 10, 2017, we held a special meeting of stockholders pursuant to which the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “A&R Charter”) providing for an extension of the period of time in which we are required to consummate a Business Combination through August 11, 2017 (the “First Extension Amendment”). The six (6) month extension was implemented in 30-day increments. Pursuant to the terms of the A&R Charter, prior to the special meeting, stockholders were given the opportunity to redeem their shares of the Company’s Common Stock for their pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account. The number of shares of Common Stock presented for redemption in connection with the First Extension Amendment was 911,200. Accordingly, following the special meeting, the Company distributed $9,305,588, or approximately $10.21 per share, to redeeming stockholders. In addition, prior to the special meeting, the Company agreed to contribute $0.025 per share to the Trust Account for each public share that was not converted in connection with the approval of the First Extension Amendment, for each 30-day period, or portion thereof, that was needed by the Company to complete a Business Combination from February 11, 2017 through August 11, 2017 (the “Contribution). The Company deposited an aggregate of $507,280 into the Company’s Trust Account in connection with the First Extension Amendment. Of the aggregate of $507,734 deposited into the Company’s Trust Account in connection with the First Extension Amendment, $425,000 was paid from funds advanced to the Company by Oomba, Inc., a Delaware corporation. (“Oomba”). The advances were non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on demand. 


On August 9, 2017, we held a special meeting of stockholders pursuant to which the stockholders approved an amendment to our A&R Charter providing for an additional extension of the period of time in which we were required to consummate a Business Combination through December 31, 2017 (the “Second Extension Amendment”). The extension was implemented in 30-day increments. Pursuant to the terms of the A&R Charter, prior to the special meeting, stockholders were given the opportunity to redeem their shares of the Company’s Common Stock for their pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account. The number of shares of Common Stock presented for redemption in connection with the Second Extension Amendment was 1,966,096. Accordingly, following the special meeting, the Company distributed $20,373,670, or approximately $10.36 per share, to redeeming stockholders. In addition, prior to the special meeting, the Company agreed to contribute $0.025 per share to the Trust Account for each public share that was not converted in connection with the approval of the Second Extension Amendment, for each 30-day period, or portion thereof, that was needed by the Company to complete a Business Combination from August 11, 2017 through December 31, 2017 (the “Second Contribution”). The Company deposited an aggregate of $164,412 into the Trust Account in connection with the Second Extension Amendment. The Second Contribution was paid by the Company and from funds loaned to us by the sponsors.
 
On December 29, 2017, we held a special meeting of stockholders pursuant to which the stockholders approved an amendment to our A&R Charter providing for an additional extension of the period of time in which we were required to consummate a Business Combination through June 30, 2018 (the “Third Extension Amendment”). The extension is to be implemented in 30-day increments. Pursuant to the terms of the A&R Charter, prior to the special meeting, stockholders were given the opportunity to redeem their shares of the Company’s Common Stock for their pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account. The number of shares of Common Stock presented for redemption in connection with the Third Extension Amendment was 537,804. Accordingly, on January 3, 2018, the Company distributed $5,635,379, or approximately $10.48 per share, to redeeming stockholders, resulting in $9,199,825 being held in the Trust Account as of January 3, 2018. In addition, prior to the special meeting, the Company agreed to contribute $0.04 per share to the Trust Account for each public share that was not converted in connection with the approval of the Third Extension Amendment, for each 30-day period, or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete a Business Combination from December 31, 2017 through June 30, 2018 (the “Third Contribution”). Furthermore, the Company agreed to prepay the contributions for the three-month period from December 31, 2017 until March 31, 2018. On January 4, 2018 and April 23, 2018, the Company deposited an aggregate of $140,475 into the Trust Account in connection with the Third Extension Amendment. The Third Contribution was paid by the Company.


On January 3, 2017, the Company received a letter (the “Letter”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) stating that the Company had not yet held an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months of the end of the Company’s fiscal year end. As a result, the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5620(a) (the “Annual Meeting Rule”). The Letter was only a notification of deficiency, not of imminent delisting, and had no contemporaneous effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s securities on NASDAQ. The Letter stated that, under NASDAQ rules, the Company had 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Rule. If NASDAQ were to accept the Company’s plan, NASDAQ could have granted the Company an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the fiscal year end, or until June 29, 2017, to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Rule. If NASDAQ did not accept the Company’s plan, the Company would have had the opportunity to appeal the decision in front of a NASDAQ Hearings Panel. The Company submitted a plan to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Rule, pursuant to which the Company noted its intention to hold the annual meeting in connection with a vote of its shareholders to extend the date by which the Company must complete a Business Combination. The Company held the annual meeting on February 10, 2017.

On April 18, 2018 and May 17, 2018, the Company received a letter from NASDAQ stating that the Company had not timely filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2017 or its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018 (the “Filings”). As a result, the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Filing Rule”).The Company has 60 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Annual Filing Rule. If NASDAQ were to accept the Company’s plan, NASDAQ could grant the Company an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the Filing’s due date, or until October 15, 2018, to regain compliance with the Filing Rule. If NASDAQ does not accept the Company’s plan, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal the decision in front of a NASDAQ Hearings Panel.
 
On May 12, 2017, the Company entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Oomba pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Oomba. On November 29, 2017, the Company terminated the Merger Agreement with Oomba because Oomba breached several of its obligations under the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, its obligation to deliver to the Company audited financial statements of Oomba on or prior to May 31, 2017. The termination of the Merger Agreement was effective as of November 29, 2017, and the Company reserved its rights to vigorously pursue all available remedies against Oomba under the Merger Agreement and applicable law. As a result of these breaches, the Company believes that approximately $867,000 of net expenses incurred by the Company are the responsibility of Oomba pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These reimbursable expenses are net of the $425,000 advanced by Oomba to the Company. 
 
While the Company believes it is owed the $867,000 from Oomba, the Company has not retained legal counsel with respect to the above demand for reimbursement, nor has the Company commenced any action against Oomba in order to collect the expenses it believes it is owed. It should also be noted that, even if the Company were to commence legal action against Oomba, the Company believes that the likelihood of collecting the receivable would be remote given that Oomba does not have sufficient cash funds to be able to make the payment. 
 
On January 3, 2018, the Company, Barington Companies Advisors, LLC (“Barington”), Hilco Global (“Hilco Global”), Hilco Merchant Resources, LLC (“HMR” and, together with Hilco Global, collectively, “Hilco”), and certain additional parties, including members of the board of directors of the Company (together with Barington and Hilco, the “Sellers”), entered into an agreement (the “Change of Control Agreement”) with Sweiss Ventures, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Sweiss”), JS Equity Holdings, LLC, a New York limited liability company (“JSE”), BAG Spac 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“BAG”), PLA99, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (”PLA”), and Oreva Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Oreva” and together with Sweiss, JSE, BAG and PLA, the “Investors”).
 
Pursuant to the Change of Control Agreement, the Sellers agreed to transfer to the Investors an aggregate of (a) 1,035,767 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Common Stock”), and (b) an aggregate of 142,500 warrants to purchase an additional 71,250 shares of Common Stock (collectively, the “Transferred Securities”). The 1,035,767 shares of Common Stock included in the Transferred Securities represented 96.5% of an aggregate of 1,073,267 insider promoter shares of Common Stock of the Company owned of record and beneficially by the Sellers (the “Insider Shares”). Under the terms of the Change of Control Agreement, the Sellers retained an aggregate of (i) 285,000 shares of Common Stock and associated rights, which entitle a holder to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of Common Stock (the “Rights”), and (ii) 37,500 promotional shares of Common Stock that were issued to directors, officers and a consultant of the Company as compensation for their services to the Company.


In consideration for their receipt of the Transferred Securities, the Investors and its affiliates obtained control of the board of directors of the Company. In such connection each of Jared L. Landaw, Jeffrey B. Hecktman, Robert Mettler, Frank R. Mori, James A. Mitarotonda and Jeffrey D. Nuechterlein, representing the entire former board of directors of the Company, resigned as directors effective as of the close of business January 4, 2018, and Adam Levin, Paul Abramowitz, Justin Ehrlich, Marc Beilinson and Colin Conway were appointed as directors of the Company, with Mr. Levin serving as Chairman of the Board. In addition, Cory Lipoff, Jeffrey D. Nuechterlein and Jared L. Landaw each resigned as officers of the Company, and Mr. Abramowitz was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, effective as of the close of business on January 4, 2018.


Mr. Abramowitz is the manager of PLA, Mr. Beilinson is the manager of BAG, Mr. Ehrlich is the manager of JSE and Mr. Levin is the manager of Sweiss.
 
Under the terms of the Change of Control Agreement, the Investors and its affiliates and associates (collectively, the “Investor Group”) agreed to use its and their best efforts to locate and consummate, on or prior to the June 30, 2018, a Business Combination for the Company acceptable to the Company’s stockholders. In addition, the Investors paid on behalf of the Company, or reimbursed the Sellers for, (i) $154,000, representing three months payment required to be paid by the Company for the Third Extension Amendment, and other accrued fees and expenses, and agreed pay approximately $59,229 in additional documented Company expenses within 30 days. The Investors also agreed to assume responsibility for all ongoing costs and expenses of the Company, including, without limitation, payments associated with the Third Extension Amendment and costs and expenses associated with running and maintaining a publicly traded company following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

On February 14, 2018, the Company, Oreva Capital Corp., (“Oreva”) and an entity formed by Oreva, POP G Foods Holding, Inc. (“Pop G”) entered into a letter of intent (the “LOI”) with Specialty Brands Holdings, LLC (“the “Seller”) and Papa Gino’s Inc.. The parties agreed that until February 28, 2018 (the “Exclusivity Period”), none of the parties nor their affiliates would seek to consummate a sale or purchase transaction with any other person or entity.
 
Under the terms of the LOI, the Seller agreed in principle to sell to Pop G 100% of the capital stock of PGHC Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “PGHC”). PGHC is a holding company that owns 100% of the capital stock of Papa Gino’s Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation, which together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Papa Gino’s, Inc., owns, operates and franchises (i) 148 company owned pizzeria restaurants and one venue licensee, under the trade name Papa Gino’s™ and (ii) 93 company owned sandwich restaurants, 31 franchised locations and three venue licensees under the trade name, D’Angelo’s™ ; in each case, throughout New England (collectively, the “Business”).
 
On or about March 21, 2018, the negotiation of the definitive stock purchase agreement was terminated as the parties were unable to agree upon the final purchase price.

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
Our Initial Business Combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
Identifying a Target Business
 
Subject to our management team’s pre-existing fiduciary duties and the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our Initial Business Combination, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. We have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:
 
● financial condition and results of operation; 
 ● growth potential; 
 ● brand recognition and potential; 
 ● return on equity or invested capital; 
 ● market capitalization or enterprise value; 
 ● experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 
 ● capital requirements; 
 ● competitive position; 
 ● barriers to entry; 
 ● stage of development of the products, processes or services; 
 ● existing distribution and potential for expansion; 
 ● degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 
 ● proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas; 
 ● impact of regulation on the business; 
 ● regulatory environment of the industry; 
 ● costs associated with effecting the business combination; 
 ● industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and 
 ● macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.
 
4

 

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Our management may not consider any of the above criteria in evaluating a prospective target business.
 
Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination remain to be determined. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the Trust Account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our Initial Business Combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the Trust Account balance. We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. To date, we have not entered into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. However, if we seek to consummate an Initial Business Combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsors and are therefore required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view, we would ask that banking firm to opine on whether the target business met the 80% fair market value test. Nevertheless, we are not required to do so and could determine not to do so without consent of our stockholders.

Lack of Business Diversification
 
We expect to complete only a single business combination, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating our Initial Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our Initial Business Combination; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.
 
Stockholder Approval of Business Combination
 
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders (but not our sponsors, officers or directors) may seek to convert their shares of Common Stock, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Initial Business Combination, into a portion of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, subject to the limitations described herein.
 
We will consummate our Initial Business Combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. As a result, if stockholders owning approximately 2% or more of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Initial Public Offering exercise conversion rights, the business combination will not be consummated. However, the actual percentages will only be able to be determined once a target business is located and we can assess all of the assets and liabilities of the combined company upon consummation of the proposed Initial Business Combination, subject to the requirement that we must have at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets upon closing of such business combination. As a result, the actual percentages of shares that can be converted may be significantly lower than our estimates. We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an Initial Business Combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the Trust Account upon consummation of such Initial Business Combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such Initial Business Combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. We may not be able to consummate a business combination unless the number of shares of Common Stock seeking conversion rights is significantly less than the 2% indicated above. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such Initial Business Combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait until June 30, 2018 in order to be able to receive a portion of the Trust Account.


Our sponsors and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of Common Stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination and (2) not to convert any shares of Common Stock into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed Initial Business Combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity.

Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
If we do not complete a business combination before June 30, 2018, unless we are able to obtain a fourth extension, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In connection with our redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us for our working capital requirements or necessary to pay our taxes payable on such funds (subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors). There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless.
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following June 30, 2018 and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.

We will seek to have all third parties and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. The underwriters in the Initial Public Offering have already executed such a waiver agreement. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party was to refuse to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, or whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the Trust Account. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the Trust Account could be less than $10.72 due to claims or potential claims of creditors as of June 30, 2018. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount then held in the Trust Account, inclusive of any interest not previously released to us.


We anticipate notifying the trustee of the Trust Account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. Our sponsors have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to their Insider Shares. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the Trust Account and from the interest income on the balance of the Trust Account (net of income and other tax obligations) that may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements. If such funds are insufficient, affiliates of Barington Capital Group, L. P. and Hilco Global have agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (in an amount not to exceed $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.
 
If we are unable to consummate an Initial Business Combination and are forced to redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.  
 
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only in the event of our failure to complete our Initial Business Combination in the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert their respective shares of Common Stock upon a business combination which is actually completed by us. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we may not be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.72 per share as of June 30, 2018.


If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the Trust Account to our public stockholders promptly after June 30, 2018, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination may delay the completion of a transaction; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to convert shares of Common Stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination; 
● | our outstanding rights, warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential future dilution they represent; 
● | our obligation to ensure that if we enter into a definitive agreement for an Initial Business Combination in which we will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the Common Stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into Common Stock basis (for instance, if the business combination would result in each share of Common Stock outstanding being exchanged for two shares of Common Stock, each right would result in the holder receiving two-tenths (2/10) of a share of Common Stock upon consummation of such business combination); 
● | our obligation to pay a fee of approximately $1,717,000 to EBC for assisting us in connection with our Initial Business Combination; 
● | our obligation to either repay or issue private units upon conversion of up to $500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our sponsors, officers, directors or their affiliates; 
● | our obligation to register the resale of the Insider Shares, as well as the private units (and underlying securities) and any shares issued to our sponsors, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and 
● | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of an Initial Business Combination. 

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our Initial Business Combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting our Initial Business Combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Subsequent to our Initial Business Combination, we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they devote at any time varies based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote an average of approximately 10 hours per week to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our Initial Business Combination.
