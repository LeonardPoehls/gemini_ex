Item 1. Business 
General 
 C. R. Bard, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the company or Bard) are engaged in the design, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. Charles Russell Bard founded the company in 1907. In 1923, the company was incorporated as C. R. Bard, Inc. and distributed an assortment of urological and surgical products. Bard became a publicly traded company in 1963 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange five years later. Currently, the company sells a broad range of products to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities on a global basis. In general, Bards products are intended to be used once and then discarded or either temporarily or permanently implanted. The company participates in the markets for vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products. Bards product strategy is based on the following tenets, which are designed to position the company for continued growth: 

 | Clinician Preference - Bard targets markets where clinicians drive purchasing decisions based on the benefits a product provides to patients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Product Leadership - The company pursues opportunities in markets where products that consistently provide superior clinical outcomes and medical economic value can attain a leadership position;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Market Growth - Bard focuses its investments in fast-growing and/or under-served markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Competitive Advantage - The company strives to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage through product quality and innovation, intellectual property protection and a core competency in managing complex clinical and regulatory requirements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Product Diversity - Bard offers a broad, diverse product portfolio to balance the risks inherent in the highly competitive and complex medical device industry.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Bards execution of this strategy has helped the company establish market leadership positions across its four product group categories. In 2016, approximately 75% of the companys net sales were derived from product lines in which the company holds a number one or number two market share position.

Vascular Products 
 Bards vascular products cover a wide range of minimally invasive devices for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). These products include: percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) catheters, chronic total occlusion (CTO) catheters, guidewires, fabrics, meshes, introducers and accessories; valvuloplasty balloons; peripheral vascular stents, self-expanding and balloon-expandable covered stents and vascular grafts; vena cava filters; and biopsy devices. Bards low-profile catheter and high-pressure balloon technology has made Conquest®, Atlas® and Dorado® PTA catheters leading choices of clinicians for the treatment of arterial venous access stenosis and other PVDs. Bard began selling the Lutonix® drug-coated PTA balloon for the treatment and prevention of vascular disease in Europe in 2012 and in the United States in October 2014, upon receipt of regulatory approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The companys Ultraverse® and VascuTrak® PTA catheters and Crosser CTO catheter give Bard one of the broadest offerings in the small-vessel segment of the PVD market. Bards line of peripheral vascular stents, covered stents and vascular grafts includes the Flair® AV (arterial venous) Access Stent Graft, ELuminexx® and LifeStar® Iliac Stents, and the LifeStent® family of stents approved for use in the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries. Bards vena cava filters product line includes devices that can be either permanently implanted or retrieved after the threat of blood clots traveling from the lower extremities to a patients lungs has passed. Bard also offers products for the treatment of ESRD through a broad line of long-term dialysis catheters with market leading products including GlidePath, Equistream®, Decathlon®, Hickman® and Reliance® catheters. Bard also offers a market leading portfolio of automatic core needle biopsy devices including MaxCore®, Magnum®, the Mission lightweight semi-automatic biopsy device and the Marquee disposable core biopsy instrument. Bards Vacora® and Finesse® devices combine the benefits of a vacuum-assisted biopsy technology with a portable, self-contained needle system for the diagnosis of breast tumors. Bard offers a wide variety of products across the percutaneous breast biopsy and tissue marker segments. The EnCor® and EnCor Enspire® breast biopsy systems allow for ultrasound-, stereotactic- and MRI-guided breast biopsy procedures, and Bards breast tissue markers include the SenoMark®, StarchMark®, Gel Mark®, UltraClip® and UltraCor® product lines. In 2014, the company began recording revenue related to royalty payments received from W.L. Gore & Associates Inc. (Gore).
Urology Products 
 Bards urology products include basic urology drainage products, fecal and urinary continence products, urological specialty products and Targeted Temperature Management products. The Foley catheter, which Bard introduced in 1934, remains one of the most frequently used products in the urology field. The company has a market-leading position in Foley catheters, including the infection control Foley catheter (Bardex® I.C. Foley catheter), which has been proven to substantially reduce the rate of urinary tract infections. The company also has a line of intermittent self-catheters and male external catheters, primarily used in non-acute settings. In January 2016, the company acquired Liberator Medical Holdings, Inc., a durable medical equipment supplier, to vertically integrate and expand its presence in the non-acute segment of the market. Other products include: fecal incontinence products; brachytherapy devices and radioactive seeds used to treat prostate cancer; intermittent urinary drainage catheters, urine monitoring and collection systems; ureteral stents; and specialty devices for stone removal procedures. The company markets the proprietary line of StatLock® catheter stabilization devices, which are used primarily to secure peripheral intravenous catheters, thereby reducing restarts and other complications. These devices are also used to secure many other types of catheters sold by Bard and other companies, including Foley catheters. In addition, the company markets the Arctic Sun® system with proprietary ArcticGel pads providing therapy for patients requiring Targeted Temperature Management. 
Oncology Products 
 Bards oncology products cover a wide range of devices used in the treatment and management of various cancers and other diseases and disorders. These include specialty vascular access catheters and ports, vascular access ultrasound devices, dialysis access catheters and enteral feeding devices. The companys specialty vascular access products serve a well-established market in which Bard holds a leading position. The features and 
 
I-2 
 
 benefits of the companys broad line of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have allowed Bard to capitalize on this important segment of the specialty vascular access market. The companys PowerPICC® catheters and PowerPort® devices can also be used to inject contrast media at high flow rates. These devices eliminate the need to place an additional catheter in the significant number of PICC and port recipients who also require contrast enhanced CT (computed tomography) scans. Bards Site-Rite® vascular access ultrasound device and Sherlock tip locator system help nurses place a PICC at a patients bedside, making PICCs a more convenient and cost-effective treatment option. The companys 3CG Tip Confirmation System can be used in place of imaging technologies such as x-rays to confirm proper placement of the PICC prior to treatment. Both Sherlock and Sherlock 3CG can be integrated into the Site Rite® system facilitating bedside placement. For patients not requiring central venous access, Bard offers a wide range of midline catheters as well as guidewire-assisted peripheral intravenous lines. 
 Surgical Specialty Products 
 Bards surgical specialty products include implanted grafts and fixation devices for hernia and soft tissue repairs in addition to hemostats and surgical sealants. The companys soft tissue repair products consist of hernia repair grafts, including permanent synthetic and bioresorbable synthetic products, natural-tissue configurations, and hernia fixation devices. Bard has a full line of products for inguinal (groin) hernias including the Perfix® Plug and 3D Max® product lines. The company has products for the repair of ventral (abdominal) hernias including the Ventrio®, Ventrio® ST, Ventralex®, Ventralex® ST and Ventralight® ST synthetic grafts. In addition, the company markets the ECHO PS® Positioning System which helps facilitate mesh deployment in laparoscopic surgical repair. Bard also markets the Phasix line of products for both inguinal and ventral hernias. The product incorporates advanced polymer technology based on a fully resorbable platform that is resorbed naturally by the body over time. The companys Phasix ST incorporates an anti-adhesion layer allowing for laparoscopic placement. Bards line of natural-tissue products includes the XenMatrix® and Allomax® grafts used to repair complex ventral hernias and soft tissue reconstruction. The company also sells XenMatrix® AB, the first of its kind anti-bacterial natural-tissue surgical graft. The companys hernia fixation devices include OptiFix, a bioresorbable-tack fixation device and Capsure®, a permanent fixation device for use in laparoscopic and open surgical procedures. Bard also offers the Progel© surgical sealant, which is the only FDA-approved product available for intraoperative sealing of air leaks in connection with open, video-assisted and robotic thoracic surgery. The companys Arista® AH hemostat product line complements Bards Progel© surgical sealant technology and is a plant based hemostat that is used as an adjunct to mechanical techniques to control bleeding in a variety of surgical procedures. 
International 
 Bard markets its products through subsidiaries to customers in over 100 countries outside the United States. The products sold in the international markets include many of the products described above. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the companys international businesses vary with market size and stage of development. The companys principal international markets are currently in Europe, China and Japan, and the company expects to continue investing to expand sales and marketing resources in order to capitalize on opportunities in other markets, such as certain emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. Generally, the company maintains a geographically-based sales organization that it believes provides greater flexibility in international markets. Approximately 72% of international sales are of products manufactured by Bard in the United States, Puerto Rico or Mexico. For financial reporting purposes, revenues and long-lived assets in significant geographic areas are presented in Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 
 Bards foreign operations are subject to certain financial and other risks, and international operations in general present complex tax and cash management issues. Relationships with customers and effective terms of sale frequently vary by country. Trade receivable balances outside the United States generally are outstanding for longer periods than in the United States, particularly in Europe. Inventory management is also an important business concern due to the potential for rapidly changing business conditions and currency exposure. Foreign 
 
I-3 
 
 currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect income and cash flows of international operations. The company attempts to hedge some of these currency exposures to help reduce the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on the business. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 
 Competition 
 The company competes in therapeutic and diagnostic medical device markets around the world. These global markets are characterized by rapid changes resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. The companys market position depends on its reliable product quality, dependable service, value proposition and ability to develop products to meet evolving market needs. The company faces a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to smaller manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products, and to a lesser extent reprocessors of single-use medical devices. Many of Bards products are patented or are the subject of patent applications. Patent protection also affects the companys market position. 
 In keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in healthcare delivery, the trend among hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers is to consolidate purchases to enhance purchasing power. The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers. This enhanced purchasing power has placed pressure on product pricing. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Marketing 
 The companys products are distributed domestically directly to hospitals and other healthcare institutions, as well as through numerous hospital/surgical supply and other medical specialty distributors with whom the company has distribution agreements. In international markets, products are distributed either directly or through distributors, with the practice varying by country. Full-time representatives of the company in domestic and international markets engage in sales promotion. Sales to distributors, which supply the companys products to many end-users, accounted for approximately 36%, 35% and 34% of the companys net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the five largest distributors combined accounted for approximately 51%, 61% and 66%, respectively, of distributors sales for the corresponding years. One large distributor accounted for approximately 8% of the companys net sales in 2016 and 9% of the companys net sales in each of 2015 and 2014. 
 In order to service its customers, optimize logistics, lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels, the company operates consolidated distribution facilities in both the United States and Europe. Orders are normally shipped within a matter of days after receipt. Backlog is not currently a significant issue for the company. 
 Most of the products sold by the company, whether manufactured by the company or by others, are sold under the BARD® trade name or trademark and/or other trademarks owned by the company. Products manufactured for the company by outside suppliers are generally produced according to the companys specifications.

 Regulation 
 The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of the companys products are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the United States. Government regulation, including detailed inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, manufacturing, marketing, sampling, distribution, recordkeeping and storage and disposal practices, substantially increases the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products. Government regulatory actions can result in the seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions. 
 Medical device laws are in effect in many of the countries in which the company does business outside the United States. These range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of the companys medical device products to requests for product data or certifications. Inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of device-related adverse events are also components of most of these regulatory systems. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing and evolving. 
 For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Third-Party Reimbursement and Healthcare Cost Containment 
 Reimbursement remains an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical devices and procedures. Difficulty in obtaining coverage, coding and payment can be a significant barrier to the commercial success of a new product or procedure. The consequences can include slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can continue for months or even years. 
 Bards products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians, which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. In addition, with respect to our durable medical equipment supplier, we also directly bill patients, insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies because it can affect the products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Manufacturers such as Bard rely on insurance reimbursement to create favorable markets for their products, while providers depend on this reimbursement to incorporate new products into their medical practices. As the largest single insurer in the United States, Medicare has a profound influence on the healthcare market. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) formulates national and local coverage policy 
 
I-5 
 
 and sets payment rates for facilities and physician providers. Additionally, most private payors will follow the lead of CMS when developing their policies and payment rates. Technology assessment organizations, including the one run by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, are consulted by public and private payors to evaluate the relative merits of new technologies and their impact on net health outcomes in an effort to get as much value for the healthcare dollar as possible. 
 The processes necessary for a manufacturer to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement are complex and usually vary from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursements to hospitals and ambulatory care facilities are typically made for procedures or episodes of care, which include the costs of devices, supplies and equipment, and provide an incentive for efficient care and careful use of more expensive technologies. 
 Third-party payors for hospital services in the United States and abroad are increasingly focused on strategies to control spending on healthcare and reward improvements in quality and patient outcomes. In addition, in an effort to better align incentives for providers, CMS and most large commercial payors have adopted policies that carry penalties for certain preventable, hospital- acquired infections such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The company believes that the Bardex® IC products are well-positioned to help its customers prevent certain hospital acquired infections. As payors focus on the net benefits provided by medical technologies, manufacturers are increasingly required to provide evidence not only of the clinical efficacy of their products, but also the economic impact they have on stakeholders in the healthcare system. The company has taken steps in recent years to bolster its health economic and outcomes research capabilities with the goal of meeting the needs of the business and customers around the world. However, the uncertainty and complexity of future legislation seeking to reform the health insurance market and the healthcare delivery system make it difficult to ultimately predict the impact on Bards business. 
 For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Raw Materials 
 The company uses a wide variety of readily available oil-based resins, textiles, alloys and latex materials for the manufacture of its devices. These materials are primarily purchased from external suppliers. Most of the raw materials are available and/or purchased only from single source suppliers. Materials are purchased from selected suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, sole-source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. Bard works closely with its suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
Environment 
 The company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the United States. The operations of the company, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. While the company continues to make capital and operational expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, management believes that such compliance will not have a material effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. For more information, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
Employees 
 The company had approximately 16,300 employees as of December 31, 2016. 
 Seasonality 
 The companys business is not affected to any material extent by seasonal factors. 
 
I-6 
 
Research and Development 
 The company is engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety and reliability of its existing products, and to expand the applications for which the uses of its products are appropriate. The company is dedicated to developing and acquiring technologies that will furnish healthcare providers with a more complete line of products to treat medical conditions through less invasive procedures and in a cost-effective manner. The companys research and development expenditures, including acquired in-process research and development, were $292.8 million, $259.2 million and $302.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The company evaluates developing technologies primarily in areas where it may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition. 
Intellectual Property 
 Patents and other proprietary rights are important to Bards business. The company also relies upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve its competitive position. 
 The company owns an extensive portfolio of patents and has numerous patent applications pending in the United States and in certain foreign countries that relate to aspects of the technology used in many of the companys products. The companys policy is to file patent applications in the United States and foreign countries where rights are available and where the company believes it is commercially advantageous to do so. However, the standards for international protection of intellectual property vary widely. The company does not consider its business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Other than the payments received from Gore, the company does not receive material revenue from licensing of its patents or other intellectual property.
