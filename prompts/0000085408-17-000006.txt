ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
Rowan Companies plc is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The terms “Rowan,” “Rowan plc,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Rowan plc and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. 
Rowan plc is a global provider of offshore contract drilling services to the international oil and gas industry, with a focus on high-specification and premium jack-up rigs and ultra-deepwater drillships. Our fleet currently consists of 29 mobile offshore drilling units, including 25 self-elevating jack-up rigs and four ultra-deepwater drillships. Our fleet operates worldwide, including the United States Gulf of Mexico (US GOM), the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, the Middle East and Trinidad. 
As of February 14, 2017, the date of our most recent Fleet Status Report, two of our four drillships were under contract in the US GOM. Additionally, we had three jack-up rigs under contract in the North Sea, nine under contract in the Middle East, three under contract in Trinidad and two under contract in the US GOM. We had an additional six marketed jack-up rigs, two cold-stacked jack-up rigs and two marketed drillship without a contract. 
We contract our drilling rigs, related equipment and work crews primarily on a “day rate” basis. Under day rate contracts, we generally receive a fixed amount per day for each day we are performing drilling or related services. In addition, our customers may pay all or a portion of the cost of moving our equipment and personnel to and from the well site. Contracts generally range in duration from one month to multiple years. 
For information with respect to our revenues, operating income and assets by operating segment, and revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Drilling Fleet
We believe our high-specification and premium jack-up fleet and ultra-deepwater drillships are well positioned to serve the worldwide market for high-pressure/high-temperature (HPHT) wells, including those in demanding locations. As of February 14, 2017, our drilling fleet consists of the following:

• | Four ultra-deepwater drillships;


• | Nineteen high-specification cantilever jack-up rigs; and


• | Six premium cantilever jack-up rigs.

We use the term “high-specification” to describe jack-ups with a hook-load capacity of at least two million pounds and the term “premium” to denote independent-leg cantilever jack-ups that can operate in at least 300 feet of water in benign environments.
Ultra-Deepwater Drillships – Our ultra-deepwater drillships are self-propelled vessels equipped with computer-controlled dynamic-positioning systems, which allow them to maintain position without anchors through the use of their onboard propulsion and station-keeping systems. Drillships have greater variable loading capacity than semisubmersible rigs, enabling them to carry more supplies on board and, thus, making them better suited for drilling in deep water in remote locations. Our drillships are equipped with two drilling stations within a single derrick allowing the drillships to perform preparatory activities off-line and potentially simultaneous drilling tasks during certain stages of drilling, subject to legal restrictions in various jurisdictions, enabling increased drilling efficiency particularly during the initial stages of a well. In addition, our drillships are equipped to drill in 12,000-foot water depths, are equipped with 2,500,000 pound hook-load capability, and are capable of drilling HPHT wells to 40,000-foot depths. Each is equipped with two fully redundant blowout preventers, which significantly reduce non-productive time associated with repair and maintenance. In addition, each drillship is equipped with an active-heave crane for simultaneous deployment of subsea equipment. The sum total of these and other advanced features make the drillships very attractive to our customers.
High-Specification and Premium Jack-up Rigs – Our jack-ups are capable of drilling wells to maximum depths ranging from 25,000 to 40,000 feet and in maximum water depths ranging from 300 to 550 feet, depending on rig size, location and outfitting. All of our high-specification rigs are equipped with the high pressure circulation and pressure control equipment that are necessary for HPHT operations. Each of our jack-ups is designed with a hull that is fully equipped to serve as a drilling platform supported by three independently elevating legs. The rig is towed to the drilling site where the legs are lowered into and penetrate the ocean 
4

floor, and the hull raises itself out of the water up to the elevation required to drill the well using a self-contained rack and pinion system. 
Our three N-Class rigs are capable of drilling in water depths to 435 feet in harsh environments such as the North Sea depending on location and outfitting. The N-Class rigs, which were designed for operation in the highly regulated Norwegian sector of the North Sea, can be equipped to perform drilling and production operations simultaneously. Our first N-Class rig, the Rowan Viking, was delivered in 2010, and the Rowan Stavanger and Rowan Norway were delivered in 2011.
Our four EXL class rigs enable HPHT drilling in water depths up to 350 feet and are equipped with a hook-load capacity of two million pounds. The first three EXL class rigs were delivered in 2010, and the Rowan EXL IV was delivered in 2011.
Our three 240C class rigs were designed for HPHT drilling in water depths up to 400 feet in benign environments and are equipped with a hook-load capacity of 2.5 million pounds. The Rowan Mississippi and the Ralph Coffman were added to the fleet in 2008 and 2009, respectively, and the Joe Douglas was added to the fleet in 2012.
Three of our four Super Gorilla class rigs were delivered during the period from 1998 to 2001 and can be equipped for simultaneous drilling and production operations. They can operate year-round in 400 feet of water in harsh environments such as the North Sea. The Bob Palmer, our fourth Super Gorilla class rig delivered in 2003, is an enhanced version of the Super Gorilla class jack-up designated a Super Gorilla XL. With 713 feet of leg, 139 feet more than the Super Gorillas, and 30 percent larger spud cans, the Bob Palmer can operate in water depths to 550 feet in normally benign environments like the US GOM and the Middle East or in water depths to 400 feet in hostile environments such as the North Sea.
Our four Tarzan Class rigs were delivered during the period from 2004 to 2008 and are specifically designed for deep-well, HPHT drilling in up to 300 feet of water in benign environments.
Our Rowan Gorilla class rig, the Rowan Gorilla IV, was designed in the mid 1980s as a heavier-duty class of jack-up rig and is capable of operating in water depths to 450 feet in benign environments.
In 2016, we sold two of our older rigs in our jack-up fleet, the Rowan Gorilla II in November and the Rowan Gorilla III in December. The units were sold under agreements that prohibit their future use as drilling units.
See Item 2, “Properties,” for additional information regarding our fleet.
Our operations are subject to many uncertainties and hazards. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional information.
Joint Venture
On November 21, 2016, Rowan and the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (“Saudi Aramco”), through their subsidiaries, entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement to create a 50/50 joint venture to own, manage and operate offshore drilling units in Saudi Arabia. The new entity is anticipated to commence operations in the second quarter of 2017.
At formation of the new company, each of Rowan and Saudi Aramco will contribute $25 million to be used for working capital needs. The Asset Contribution and Transfer Agreements provide that at commencement of operations, Rowan will contribute three rigs and its local shore based operations, and Saudi Aramco will contribute two rigs and cash to maintain equal equity ownership in the new company. Rowan will then contribute two more rigs in late 2018 when those rigs complete their current contracts, and Saudi Aramco will make a matching cash contribution at that time. At the various asset contribution dates, excess cash is expected to be distributed in equal parts to the shareholders. Rigs contributed will receive contracts for an aggregate 15 years, renewed and re-priced every three years, provided that the rigs meet the technical and operational requirements of Saudi Aramco.
Rowan rigs in Saudi Arabia not selected for contribution will be managed by the new company until the end of their current contracts pursuant to a management services agreement that provides for a management fee equal to a percentage of revenue to cover overhead costs. After the management period ends, such rigs may be selected for contribution, lease, or they will be required to relocate outside of the Kingdom.
Each of Rowan and Saudi Aramco will be obligated to fund their portion of the purchase of up to 20 new build jack-up rigs ratably over 10 years. The first rig is expected to be delivered as early as 2021. The partners intend that the newbuild jack-up rigs will be financed out of available cash from operations and/or funds available from third party debt financing. Saudi Aramco as a customer will provide drilling contracts to support the new company in the acquisition of the new rigs. If cash from operations or financing is not available to fund the cost of the newbuild jack-up rig, each partner is obligated to contribute funds to purchase such rigs, up to a maximum amount of $1.25 billion per partner in the aggregate for all 20 newbuild jack-up rigs.

Contracts
Our drilling contracts generally provide for a fixed amount of compensation per day (day rate), and are either “well-to-well,” “multiple-well” or "fixed-term" generally ranging from one month to several years. Well-to-well contracts are typically cancellable by either party upon completion of drilling.  Fixed-term contracts usually contain a termination provision such that either party may terminate if drilling operations are suspended for extended periods as a result of events of force majeure.  While many fixed-term contracts are for relatively short periods of three months or less, many others are for one or more years, and all can continue for periods longer than the original terms. Well-to-well contracts can be extended over multiple series of wells.  Many drilling contracts contain renewal or extension provisions exercisable at the option of the customer at mutually agreeable rates.  Many of our drilling contracts provide for separate lump-sum payments for rig mobilization and demobilization. We recognize lump-sum fees and related expenses over the primary contract term. We recognize reimbursement of certain costs as revenues and expenses at the time they are incurred.  Our contracts for work generally provide for payment in United States (U.S.) dollars except for amounts required by applicable law to be paid in the local currency or amounts required to meet local expenses.
A number of factors affect our ability to obtain contracts at profitable rates within a given region.  Such factors, which are discussed further under “Competition” and in “Risk Factors” include the global economic climate, the price of oil and gas which can affect our customers' drilling budgets, over- or under-supply of drilling units, location and availability of competitive equipment, the suitability of equipment for the project, comparative operating cost of the equipment, competence of drilling personnel and other competitive factors.  Profitability may also depend on receiving adequate compensation for the cost of moving equipment to drilling locations.
During periods of weak demand and declining day rates, we have historically entered into contracts at lower rates in order to keep our rigs working. At times, however, market conditions have forced us to "warm-stack" rigs to reduce costs during extended periods between contracts.  We currently have two ultra-deepwater drillships and five jack-ups warm stacked. We have also cold stacked certain of our idle older rigs to reduce cost further and have ultimately sold five such rigs over the last two years, the Rowan Juneau, Rowan Alaska, Rowan Louisiana, Rowan Gorilla II and Rowan Gorilla III. All but the Rowan Louisiana were sold under agreements that prohibit their future use as drilling units. 
Our contract backlog was estimated to be approximately $1.7 billion at February 14, 2017, down from approximately $3.6 billion at January 20, 2016. Backlog at February 14, 2017 does not account for anticipated changes to the Middle East fleet due to the formation of the 50/50 joint venture with Saudi Aramco expected to commence operations in second quarter 2017. See "Joint Venture" above and "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information with respect to our backlog.
Competition
The contract drilling industry is highly competitive, and success in obtaining contracts involves many factors, including supply and demand for drilling units, price, rig capability, operating and safety performance, and reputation.
In the jack-up drilling market, we compete with numerous offshore drilling contractors that together have 458 marketed jack-up rigs worldwide as of February 14, 2017, with an additional 103 units that are under construction or on order.  (We define marketed rigs as all rigs that are not cold-stacked.) We estimate that 69 delivered and marketed jack-ups, or 15 percent of the world’s marketed jack-up fleet, are high-specification, including Rowan's 19 high-specification rigs. At February 14, 2017, there were 213 marketed floaters (drillships and semi-submersibles) worldwide, with an additional 48 units that are under construction or on order. We estimate that 100 of these floaters, or approximately 47 percent of the world’s marketed fleet, are capable of drilling in water depths of 10,000 feet or more, but only an estimated 32 floaters, or approximately 15 percent of the world's marketed fleet, have 2,500,000 pound hook-load capability and are equipped with dual blow-out preventers, which are key specifications valued by our customers.
A significant contributing factor to the softness in the offshore drilling market has been the influx of 231 newbuild jack-ups and 158 newbuild floaters delivered since early 2006. The addition of newbuild units, combined with numerous rigs having rolled off contracts in past months, has continued to increase competition, putting additional downward pressure on day rates and utilization. Of the approximately 103 jack-up rigs under construction worldwide scheduled for delivery through 2020 (33% of the currently utilized jack-up fleet of approximately 310 rigs), approximately 50 are considered high-specification (72% of the delivered high-specification fleet). Currently, there are approximately 77 competitive newbuild jack-up rigs scheduled for delivery during 2017, and only five have contracts. For the floater market there are approximately 48 floaters under construction worldwide for delivery through 2020 (32% of the currently utilized floater fleet of approximately 149 rigs). Following the negotiated delivery delays on several units into future years, there are approximately 30 competitive newbuild floaters scheduled for delivery during 2017, with 11 having contracts.

Based on the number of rigs as tabulated by IHS-Petrodata, we are the seventh largest offshore drilling contractor in the world and the fifth largest jack-up rig operator. Based on market capitalization, we are the fourth largest publically traded pure play offshore driller. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources and may be more able to make technological improvements to existing equipment or replace equipment that becomes obsolete.  In addition, those contractors with larger and more diversified drilling fleets may be better positioned to withstand unfavorable market conditions.
We market our drilling services to present and potential customers, including large international energy companies, smaller independent energy companies and foreign government-owned or government-controlled energy companies.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of current and anticipated industry conditions and their impact on our operations.
Governmental Regulation
Many aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulation, including those relating to environmental protection and pollution control. In addition, governmental regulations concerning licensing and permitting, equipment specifications, training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of our operations and could reduce exploration activity in the areas in which we operate.
We could become liable for damages resulting from pollution which could materially affect our financial position, operations and liquidity. Generally we are indemnified under our drilling contracts for pollution, well damage and environmental damage, except in certain cases of pollution emanating above the surface from our drilling rigs. This indemnity includes costs associated with regaining control of a wild well, removal and disposal of pollutants, environmental remediation and claims by third parties for damages. However, such contractual indemnification provisions may not adequately protect us for several reasons such as (i) the contractual indemnity provisions may require us to assume some of the liability; (ii) our customers may not have the financial resources necessary to honor the contractual indemnity provisions; or (iii) the contractual indemnity provisions may be unenforceable under applicable law.
Our customers often require us to assume responsibility for pollution damages when we are at fault. We seek to limit our liability exposure to a non-material amount, or an amount within the limits of our available insurance coverage. For example, a contract may provide that we will assume the first $5 million of costs related to an incident resulting in wellbore pollution due to our negligence, with the customer assuming responsibility for all costs in excess of $5 million. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to negotiate indemnities and/or limitation of liability provisions or that such indemnification and/or limitation of liability provisions can be enforced or will be sufficient. Our customers may challenge the validity or enforceability of the indemnity provision for several reasons, including but not limited to applicable law, judicial decisions, the language of the indemnity provision, reasons of public policy, degree of fault and/or the circumstances resulting in the pollution.
In the event of an incident resulting in wellbore pollution where we are liable for all or a portion of such event, the impact on our financial position, operations and liquidity would depend on the scope of the incident. In this instance, we would seek to enforce our legal rights, including the enforcement of the indemnity obligation and redress from all parties at fault. In addition, we maintain limited insurance for liability related to negative environmental impacts of a sudden and accidental pollution event, as described below. Such an event would adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows if both insurance and indemnity protection were unavailable or insufficient and the incident was significant.
The U.S., U.K. and other other jurisdictions in which we operate have various regulations and requirements with which we must comply. For example, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Permit (NPDES permit) is required for discharges into the US GOM. The permit holder is the designated responsible party for any environmental impacts that occur in the event of the discharge of any unpermitted substance, including a fuel spill or oil leak from an offshore installation such as a mobile drilling unit. We operate in accordance with NPDES permit standards regardless of the holder. 
Pursuant to the U.K. Offshore Directive, we are required to have an approved Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (OPEP) for each drilling unit operating in U.K. waters. The Offshore Directive also specifies additional regulations related to safety, licensing, environmental protection, emergency response and liability with which we comply. 
Additionally, pursuant to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), we are required to have a Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (SOPEP) for each of our drilling units. Our SOPEP establishes detailed procedures for rapid and effective response to spill events that may occur as a result of our operations or those of the operator. This plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary. Onboard drills are conducted periodically to maintain effectiveness of the plan, and each rig is outfitted with equipment to respond to minor spills. For operations in the U.S., our SOPEPs are subject to review and approval by various organizations including the United States Coast Guard, the EPA and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), and are recertified every five years by the American Bureau of Shipping, a Recognized Organization under the IMO.

As the designated responsible party, an operator has the primary responsibility for spill response, including having contractual arrangements in place with emergency spill response organizations to supplement any onboard spill response equipment. Pursuant to our SOPEPs, we have certain resources and supplies onboard our drilling units to mitigate the impact of an incident until an emergency spill response organization can deploy its resources. However, we also have an agreement with an emergency spill response organization should we have an incident that exceeds the scope of our onboard spill response equipment. Our primary spill response provider in the U.S. has been in business since 1994 and specializes in helping industries prevent and clean up oil and other hydrocarbon spills. Our provider has represented it holds all necessary licenses, certifications and permits to respond to environmental emergencies in the US GOM and maintains contacts with other response resources and organizations outside the US GOM. We believe we have adequate equipment and third-party resources available to us to respond to an emergency spill; however, we can provide no assurance that adequate resources will be available. 
We are actively involved in various industry-led initiatives and work groups, including but not limited to those of the American Petroleum Institute, the International Association of Drilling Contractors, the Ocean Energy Safety Institute, and the British Rig Owners Association, which are intended to improve safety and protection of the environment.
Oil and gas operations in the US GOM and in many of the other jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to regulation with respect to well design, casing and cementing and well control procedures, as well as rules requiring operators to systematically identify risks and establish safeguards against those risks through a comprehensive safety and environmental management system, or SEMS. Any serious oil and gas industry related event heightens governmental and environmental concerns and may lead to legislative proposals being introduced which may materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas. New regulations continue to be implemented, including rules regarding drilling systems and equipment, such as blowout preventer and well-control systems and lifesaving systems, as well as rules regarding employee training, engaging personnel in safety management and requiring third-party audits of SEMS programs.
On July 28, 2016, BSEE published a final rule, Oil and Gas and Sulfur Operations in the Outer Continental Shelf-Blowout Preventer Systems and Well Control to implement recommendations of the Deepwater Horizon Commission. The new regulations took effect on July 28, 2016, with a number of requirements to be phased in over several years. 
Regulatory compliance has and may continue to materially impact our capital expenditures and earnings, particularly in the event of an environmental incident. Given the state-of-the-art design of our drillships and high specification of our jack-up fleet, we believe we are well positioned competitively to our peers to be able to comply with current and future governmental regulations. 
Insurance
We maintain insurance coverage for damage to our drilling rigs, third-party liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, sudden and accidental pollution and other types of loss or damage. Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and self-insured retentions which must be met prior to any recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and we can provide no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.
Our current insurance policies provide coverage for loss or damage to our fleet of drilling rigs on an agreed value basis (which varies by unit) subject to a deductible of either $25 million or $15 million per occurrence, depending on the unit's geographic location. This coverage does not include damage to our rigs arising from a US GOM named windstorm, for which we are self-insured.
We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage for liability associated with negative environmental impacts of a sudden and accidental pollution event, third-party liability, employers’ liability (including Jones Act liability) and automobile liability, and these policies are subject to various exclusions, deductibles and underlying limits. In addition, we maintain excess liability coverage with an annual aggregate limit of $700 million subject to a self-insured retention of $10 million except for liabilities (including removal of wreck) arising out of a US GOM named windstorm, which are subject to a self-insured retention of $200 million.
Our rig physical damage and liability insurance renews each June. We can provide no assurance we will be able to secure coverage of a similar nature with similar limits at comparable costs.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, we had 2,917 employees worldwide, compared to 3,496 and 4,051 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 264 independent contractors. Certain of our employees and contractors in international markets, such as Trinidad and Norway, are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiation. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
