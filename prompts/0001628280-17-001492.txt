Competition
We face strong competition in attracting and retaining deposits, originating loans, and providing title services. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from other commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions located in our market areas, including many large financial institutions that have greater financial and marketing resources available to them. In addition, during times of high interest rates, we have faced significant competition for investors’ funds from short-term money market securities, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. Our ability to attract and retain customer deposits depends on our ability to generally provide a mix of return on deposited funds, liquidity and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment opportunities.
We experience strong competition for loan originations principally from other commercial banks, savings institutions, and mortgage banking companies. We compete for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees we charge, the efficiency and quality of services we provide borrowers, and the convenient locations of our branch office network and access to services such as mobile banking.
Employees
We had 3,045 full-time associates and 110 part-time associates as of December 31, 2016. None of these associates is represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we enjoy an excellent relationship with our associates. 
Business Combinations
We continually evaluate business combination opportunities and sometimes conduct due diligence activities in connection with them. As a result, business combination discussions and, in some cases, negotiations, take place, and transactions involving cash, debt or equity securities could be expected. Any future business combinations or series of business combinations that we might undertake may be material to our consolidated financial performance and position.

Supervision and Regulation
The banking industry is extensively regulated under both federal and applicable state laws. The following discussion is a summary of certain statutes and regulations applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides specific information relevant to us. Regulation of financial institutions is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, deposit insurance funds and the banking system, and generally is not intended for the protection of shareholders. Proposals are frequently introduced to change federal and state laws and regulations applicable to us, and new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations (including changes in interpretations or enforcement) could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes might have on us are impossible to determine with any certainty. References to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations.
General
We are a bank holding company and have elected to be a financial holding company with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”). We are subject to examination and supervision by the FRB pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and are required to file reports and other information with the FRB regarding our business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries.
Generally, the BHCA provides for “umbrella” regulation of bank holding companies by the FRB and functional regulation of holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory agencies. The BHCA, however, requires the FRB to examine any subsidiary of a bank holding company, other than a depository institution, engaged in activities permissible for a depository institution. The FRB is also granted the authority, in certain circumstances, to require reports of, and to examine and adopt rules applicable to, any bank holding company subsidiary.
In general, the BHCA and the FRB’s regulations limit the nonbanking activities permissible for bank holding companies to those activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks to be a proper incident thereto. A bank holding company such as us that has elected to be a financial holding company, however, may engage in, or acquire and retain shares of companies engaged in, a broader range of activities that are considered (i) “financial in nature” (as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and FRB regulations) or incidental to such financial activities (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury), or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. These activities include, among other things, securities underwriting, dealing and market-making, sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency activities, and merchant banking. Refer to “Holding Company Regulation - Financial Holding Company Status” below.
Because we are a public company, we are also subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC has established three categories of registrants for the purpose of filing periodic and annual reports. Under these regulations, we are considered to be a “large accelerated filer” and, as such, must comply with SEC large accelerated reporting requirements.
As a Louisiana-chartered commercial bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, IBERIABANK is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of Financial Institutions of the State of Louisiana (the “OFI”), IBERIABANK’s chartering authority, and the FRB, IBERIABANK’s primary federal regulator. IBERIABANK is also subject to regulation and supervision in certain respects by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB") as well as to regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), which insures the deposits of IBERIABANK to the maximum extent permitted by law.
State and federal laws govern the activities in which IBERIABANK may engage, the investments it may make and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect IBERIABANK’s operations.
The banking industry is affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the national supply of bank credit to moderate recessions and to curb inflation. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the FRB to implement its objectives are: open-market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate and the federal funds rate (which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight borrowings) and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits.
3

In addition to federal and state banking laws and regulations, we and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates, including those that engage in securities brokerage and insurance activities, are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations, and supervision and examination by other state and federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the SEC, and various state insurance and securities regulators.
The Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), enacted in 2010, significantly restructured financial regulation in the United States, including through the creation of a new resolution authority, mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements and directing changes in the way banks are assessed for federal deposit insurance, as well as through numerous other provisions intended to strengthen the financial services sector.
The following summarizes significant aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that may materially affect the operations of the Company and IBERIABANK:

• | The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it with extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services. IBERIABANK is subject to numerous consumer financial protection regulations administered by the CFPB, and is also subject to CFPB supervision and examination with respect to its compliance with such regulations. 


• | The Dodd-Frank Act established the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk.


• | The BHCA was amended to include a statutory requirement that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength for their banking subsidiaries.


• | The federal banking agencies were required to promulgate new rules on regulatory capital for depository institutions and their holding companies. See “Basel III Capital Rules” below.


• | The minimum ratio of the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund’s reserves was increased to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits.


• | The so-called “Durbin Amendment” to the Dodd-Frank Act required the FRB to establish a cap on the rate merchants pay banks for electronic clearing of debit transactions (i.e., the interchange rate). The FRB’s regulation implementing the Durbin Amendment severely limited the interchange fees that banks charge merchants for debit card transactions, starting in late 2011. As a result of the interchange fee structure imposed by such regulation, our electronic banking income was and continues to be negatively impacted. 

Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have delayed effective dates, and the legislation required various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations, some of which have not yet been issued in final form. The Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations have increased and may continue to increase our operating and compliance costs.
The Volcker Rule. In December 2013, the FRB and other federal agencies issued final rules to implement the so-called “Volcker Rule” contained in the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally became effective on July 21, 2015. The Volcker Rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates (referred to as “banking entities”) from: (i) engaging in “proprietary trading” and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (“covered funds”) subject to certain limited exceptions. These prohibitions affect the ability of U.S. banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with non-U.S. banking organizations in overseas markets. The rule also effectively prohibits short-term trading strategies by any U.S. banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading. 
The final Volcker Rule regulation provides certain exemptions allowing banking entities to continue underwriting, market-making and hedging activities and trading certain government obligations, as well as various exemptions and exclusions from the definition of “covered funds.” The final rule imposes certain reporting and compliance requirements on banking entities that engage in exempted trading activities. The level of required compliance depends on the size of the banking entity and the extent of its trading, with most requirements applicable only to banking entities with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, or those with $50 billion or more in worldwide trading assets and liabilities. As a banking entity with more 
4

than $10 billion in total assets but less than $10 billion in total trading assets and liabilities, we were required by the final Volcker Rule to implement a compliance program appropriate for the types, size, scope, and complexity of our permitted trading activities. To date, the Volcker Rule’s compliance requirements have not had a material effect on our operations. 
Basel III Capital Rules
In 2013, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies issued final rules (the “Basel III Capital Rules”) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including the Company and IBERIABANK. The Basel III Capital Rules redefined the components of regulatory capital and addressed other issues affecting the numerator in calculating banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also revised risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in calculating banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios with a more risk-sensitive approach. The Company and IBERIABANK became subject to the Basel III Capital Rules on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods as discussed below. 
Among other new requirements, the Basel III Capital Rules (i) introduced a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (CET1), (ii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements and (iii) expanded the scope of the deductions/adjustments from capital as compared to previously effective regulations. CET1 is defined as the sum of common stock and related surplus net of treasury stock, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) (which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities amongst other items) and qualifying minority interest, less applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions that include AOCI. 
Banking organizations were provided a one-time option in the first quarter of 2015 to permanently opt out of the inclusion of most AOCI in their calculation of CET1. The Company and IBERIABANK elected to opt out in order to reduce the impact of market volatility on their regulatory capital levels.
Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios effective as of January 1, 2015 are as follows:
•4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets.
•6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets.
•8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets.
•4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the "leverage ratio").
The Basel III Capital Rules also introduced a “capital conservation buffer”, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions are required to maintain a buffer composed of CET1 in an amount greater than 2.5% above the minimum CET1, Tier 1, and Total risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid limitations on dividend payments, equity repurchases and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Company and IBERIABANK to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as compared to a current minimum leverage ratio of 3% for certain highly rated banking organizations). Implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased in incrementally over a three-year period until reaching 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions from and adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a three-year period ending January 1, 2018.
5

The Basel III Capital Rules also preclude counting certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies. Tier 1 capital treatment for the Company’s trust preferred securities was subject to phase-out during 2015, with 75% phased out effective January 1, 2015 and the remainder phased out effective January 1, 2016. 
The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that substantially revises the risk weights assigned by the previously effective capital regulations. Material changes include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise on non-accrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital; and increased risk-weights (from 0% to up to 600%) for equity exposures.
Failure to meet applicable capital standards could subject the bank holding company or financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authorities of a capital directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC. In addition, the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under “Federal Banking Regulation - Prompt Corrective Action” as applicable to “under-capitalized” institutions.
The FRB’s capital standards specify that evaluations by the FRB of a bank’s capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of the bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates. The federal banking agencies have issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management.
Additional information, including our and IBERIABANK’s compliance with applicable capital adequacy standards at December 31, 2016, is provided in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources” in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Federal Banking Regulation
FDIC Insurance. The FDIC, through the Deposit Insurance Fund, insures deposit accounts in IBERIABANK up to $250,000 per separately insured deposit ownership right or category. IBERIABANK pays deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC based on assessment rates established by the FDIC. The FDIC may increase or decrease the range of assessments uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base assessment rate without notice and comment rulemaking. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, provides for a minimum required ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund’s deposit insurance reserves to estimated insured deposits, or designated reserve ratio (the “DRR”), of 1.15% through September 2020, with a DRR of 1.35% required thereafter. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are required to fund the increase in the DRR to 1.35%.
In 2011, the FDIC adopted a rule that provides for the lowering of the insurance assessment rate schedule for all banks as of the quarter after the DRR reaches 1.15%. In addition, a final rule issued by the FDIC in March 2016 requires insured institutions with an assessment base (total assets less tangible capital) of over $10 billion, such as IBERIABANK, to pay surcharge insurance assessments at an annual rate of 4.5 basis points of their assessment base, starting the quarter after the DRR surpasses 1.15% and ending when the DRR reaches 1.35%. The 4.5 basis point surcharge will be assessed against each covered institution’s assessment base, less $10 billion. 
The Deposit Insurance Fund’s DRR exceeded 1.15% as of June 30, 2016. As a result, the base deposit insurance rates now range from (i) 1.5 to 30 basis points of an institution’s assessment base for small banks and (ii) 1.5 to 40 basis points for institutions with an assessment base of over $10 billion, which are also now subject to the 4.5 basis point surcharge. The FDIC has stated that it expects that the DRR will likely reach 1.35%, allowing termination of the surcharge, in 2018.
In addition, the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 authorized the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) to impose assessments on applicable deposits in order to service the interest on FICO’s bond obligations from deposit insurance fund assessments. The amount assessed on individual institutions by FICO is in addition to the amount paid for deposit insurance 
6

under the FDIC’s risk-related assessment rate schedules. The bonds issued by FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. IBERIABANK recognized approximately $1.0 million of expense related to its FICO assessments in 2016.
Liquidity Requirements. Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter without required formulaic measures. The Basel III framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward such measures will be required by regulation. One test, the liquidity coverage ratio, is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. The other test, the net stable funding ratio, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements are intended to incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source.
Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, known as FDICIA, requires federal banking regulatory authorities to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: “well-capitalized,” “adequately-capitalized,” “under-capitalized,” “significantly under-capitalized,” and “critically under-capitalized.” Under the FRB’s regulations implementing FDICIA’s prompt corrective action provisions, which were amended to incorporate the regulatory capital standards implemented by the Basel III Capital Rules, an institution is deemed to be:

• | “well-capitalized” if it has a CET 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure;


• | “adequately capitalized” if it has a CET1 ratio of 4.5% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater and the institution does not meet the definition of a “well-capitalized” institution;


• | “under-capitalized” if it does not meet one or more of the “adequately-capitalized” tests;


• | “significantly under-capitalized” if it has a CET 1 ratio of less than 3%, a leverage ratio that is less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4% , or a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%; and 


• | “critically under-capitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity, as defined in the regulations, to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.

Throughout 2016 and as of December 31, 2016, IBERIABANK's regulatory capital ratios were in excess of the levels established for “well-capitalized” institutions.
FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would be “under-capitalized” after such payment. “Under-capitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking agency to submit a capital restoration plan. If any depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration plan, the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such plan.
If an “under-capitalized” institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly under-capitalized.” “Significantly under-capitalized” institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately-capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
“Critically under-capitalized” institutions may not, beginning 60 days after becoming “critically under-capitalized,” make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt. In addition, “critically under-capitalized” institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classified.
A depository institution that is not “well-capitalized” is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market. As previously stated, IBERIABANK is “well-
7

capitalized” and the FDICIA brokered deposit rule did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits. IBERIABANK had $1.6 billion of such brokered deposits at December 31, 2016.
Federal Reserve Bank Membership. IBERIABANK is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and is required to buy stock in the Federal Reserve Bank in an amount equal to 6% of IBERIABANK’s paid-in capital and surplus. Through December 31, 2015, IBERIABANK received statutory dividends of 6% per year on the stock it holds in the Federal Reserve Bank. Under the Fixing Americas Surface Transportation Act (the "FAST ACT"), enacted in 2015, the dividend rate to Federal Reserve member banks with assets of more than $10 billion, such as IBERIABANK, was reduced effective January 1, 2016 to the lesser of (i) the high yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note at the last auction prior to the dividend payment or (ii) 6%. This statute reduced the Federal Reserve Bank dividends paid to IBERIABANK in 2016 by approximately $1.4 million from the 2015 total.
On February 9, 2017, the American Bankers Association filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims which claims that the FAST Act's reduction of Federal Reserve Bank dividend payments constituted a breach of a century-old contract with the Federal Reserve and a taking of private property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment and seeks money damages for affected banks resulting from the reduction of the dividend payment rate. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of such litigation.
Affiliate Transactions. IBERIABANK is subject to Regulation W, which comprehensively implements statutory restrictions on transactions between a bank and its affiliates and incorporates the FRB’s interpretations and exemptions relating to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. 
Section 23A and the implementing provisions of Regulation W generally place limits on the amount of a bank’s loans or extensions of credit to, investments in, or certain other transactions with affiliates, and on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates. In general, IBERIABANK’s “affiliates” are IBERIABANK Corporation and our non-bank subsidiaries.
Section 23B and the implementing provisions of Regulation W generally require a bank’s transactions with its affiliates to be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies.
IBERIABANK is also subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders and their related interests. Such extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations, requires insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The statute and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions. Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory enforcement action, may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements. 
Consumer Protection Laws. In connection with our deposit-taking, lending and other activities, IBERIABANK is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending and other financial services to various sectors of the economy and population. The CFPB issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws, which include, among others, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Truth in Savings Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. IBERIABANK’S consumer financial products and services are subject to the regulations of the CFPB and, as an institution with assets of more than $10 billion, IBERIABANK is examined by the CFPB for compliance with these rules. 
In addition, customer privacy statutes and regulations limit the ability of the Bank to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. These laws require us to provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices and to give our customers an option to prevent their non-public personal information from being shared with non-affiliated third parties or with our affiliates.

Community Reinvestment Act. All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”) and related federal regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a state-chartered Federal Reserve member bank like IBERIABANK, the FRB is required to assess our record of compliance with the CRA. Such assessment is reviewed by the FRB when the Company or IBERIABANK makes application for approval of an expansionary proposal, such as a merger or other acquisition of another bank or the opening of a new branch office. In addition, in order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHCA or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHCA, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the CRA. IBERIABANK received a “satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent assessment by the FRB.
Incentive Compensation. Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder.
In 2010, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued guidance on incentive compensation policies (the “2010 Guidance”) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The 2010 Guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The 2010 Guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In April and May 2016, the federal banking agencies and the SEC issued for comment a proposed interagency rule that would require the reporting of incentive-based compensation arrangements at a covered financial institution when such compensation is excessive, could expose the institution to inappropriate risks, or potentially lead to material financial loss. The proposed rule, if adopted in final form, would impose no material requirements on institutions with total assets of less than $50 billion, like the Company and IBERIABANK, other than those already applied to such institutions by the 2010 Guidance. 
The final interagency rules on incentive compensation required under the Dodd-Frank Act have not been published, and it is uncertain at this time whether the proposed rule will be issued in final form or whether the agencies will issue a substantially revised proposed rule. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with the requirements of such final rules will adversely affect our and our subsidiaries’ ability to hire, retain and motivate their key employees.
Holding Company Regulation
General. As a bank holding company, we are subject to FRB examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the BHCA. The FRB has broad enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries. The FRB has authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule, regulation, administrative order or written agreement with a federal regulator. These powers may be exercised through the issuance of cease and desist orders, civil money penalties or other formal or informal actions.
Source of Strength. As a statutory requirement, a bank holding company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. Under this source of strength doctrine, the FRB may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. The FRB may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the FRB believes might jeopardize its ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company does not have the resources to provide it.

In addition, any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations.
Moreover, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expenses and the claims of holders of deposit liabilities of such an institution are accorded priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors of such an institution, including the holders of the institution’s note obligations, in the event of liquidation or other resolution of the institution. Claims of a receiver for administrative expenses and claims of holders of deposit liabilities of IBERIABANK, including the FDIC as the insurer of such holders, would receive priority over the holders of notes and other senior debt of IBERIABANK in the event of liquidation or other resolution and over our interests as sole shareholder of IBERIABANK.
Louisiana law permits the Commissioner of the OFI to require a special assessment of shareholders of a Louisiana-chartered bank whose capital has become impaired to remedy an impairment in such bank’s capital stock. This statute also provides that the Commissioner may suspend a bank’s certificate of authority until the capital is restored. As the sole shareholder of IBERIABANK, we are subject to such statute.
Stress Testing Requirements. As a bank holding company with total consolidated assets in excess of $10 billion, we are required under the Dodd-Frank Act and FRB regulation to conduct an annual stress test that projects our performance in various economic scenarios provided by the FRB. The Dodd-Frank Act stress tests are forward-looking exercises conducted by the FRB and financial companies regulated by the FRB to help ensure institutions have sufficient capital to absorb losses and support operations during adverse economic conditions. We are required to make certain assumptions in modeling future performance and must support these assumptions through statistical analysis and observed market behavior where applicable. The outcome of the FRB’s analysis of our projected performance (to include capital, earnings, and balance sheet changes) will be used in supervision of us and will assist the FRB in assessing our risk profile and capital adequacy. The results of our stress test could hinder our ability to pay quarterly cash dividends to shareholders as has been our practice, and could also impact the FRB’s decisions regarding future acquisitions by us. The results of our annual stress test are available on our website at www.iberiabank.com.
The federal banking agencies have issued joint supervisory guidance for stress testing practices applicable to banking organizations with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as us and IBERIABANK. The guidance addresses stress testing in connection with overall risk management, including capital and liquidity planning. The guidance outlines general principles for stress testing and highlights the importance of stress testing as an ongoing risk management practice that supports a banking organization’s forward-looking assessment of its risks. It outlines broad principles for a satisfactory stress testing framework and describes the manner in which stress testing should be employed as an integral component of risk management.
Dividends. We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. The majority of our revenue is from dividends paid to us by IBERIABANK. IBERIABANK is subject to federal and state laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay. In addition, we and IBERIABANK are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums, and to remain “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. The FRB has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for a bank holding company to pay dividends unless the bank holding company’s net income over the preceding year is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
In addition to the limitations placed on the payment of dividends at the holding company level, there are various legal and regulatory limits on the extent to which IBERIABANK may pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to us. IBERIABANK is subject to laws and regulations of Louisiana, which place certain restrictions on the payment of dividends. Additionally, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, IBERIABANK is subject to regulations of the FRB.
We do not expect that these laws, regulations or policies will materially affect our ability to pay dividends. Additional information is provided in Note 14 and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated herein by reference. 
Acquisitions. We comply with numerous laws relating to our acquisition activity. Under the BHCA, we are required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank holding company or bank or merge or consolidate with another bank holding company. Federal law authorizes bank holding companies to make interstate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without geographic 
10

limitation. Furthermore, a bank headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in another state, subject to any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years; and subject to certain deposit market-share limitations. After a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where a bank headquartered in that state could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provided authority for any bank to open de novo branches in any other state as if it were chartered in that state.
During 2015, the Company expanded its presence in Florida and Georgia through acquisitions of Florida Bank Group on February 28, 2015, Old Florida Bancshares, Inc. on March 31, 2015 and Georgia Commerce Bancshares, Inc. on May 31, 2015. Additional information is provided in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated herein by reference.
There were no acquisitions during 2016.
Financial Holding Company Status. A bank holding company meeting certain requirements may qualify and elect to become a financial holding company, permitting the bank holding company to engage in additional activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activity. Financial holding companies are authorized by the BHCA to engage in a number of financial activities previously impermissible for bank holding companies, including equity securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; and merchant banking activities through securities or insurance affiliates; and insurance company portfolio investments. The BHCA also permits the FRB to authorize additional activities for financial holding companies if they are “financial in nature” or “incidental” to financial activities.
For a bank holding company to be eligible to elect financial holding company status, the holding company must be both “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” under applicable regulatory standards, and all of its subsidiary banks also must be “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” and must have received at least a satisfactory rating on such institution’s most recent examination under the CRA. A financial holding company that continues to meet all of such requirements may engage directly or indirectly in activities considered financial in nature (discussed above), either de novo or by acquisition, as long as it gives the FRB after-the-fact notice of the new activities. If a financial holding company fails to continue to meet any of the prerequisites for financial holding company status after engaging in activities not permissible for bank holding companies that have not elected to be treated as financial holding companies, the company must enter into an agreement with the FRB that it will comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the financial holding company does not return to compliance within 180 days, or such longer period as agreed to by the FRB, the FRB may order the company to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies or divest investments in companies engaged in such activities. In addition, if any banking subsidiary of a financial holding company receives a CRA rating of less than satisfactory, the holding company would be prohibited from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the SOX Act, implements a broad range of corporate governance, accounting and disclosure requirements for public companies, and also for their directors and officers. SEC rules adopted to implement the SOX Act requirements require our chief executive and chief financial officer to certify certain financial and other information included in our quarterly and annual reports. The rules also require these officers to certify that they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures; that they have made certain disclosures to the auditors and to the Audit Committee of the board of directors about our controls and procedures; and that they have included information in their quarterly and annual filings about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes to the controls and procedures or other factors which would significantly impact these controls subsequent to their evaluation. Section 404 of the SOX Act requires management to undertake an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and requires our auditors to attest to and report on the effectiveness of these controls. See Item 9A. - “Controls and Procedures” for our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the SOX Act also accompany this Report on Form 10-K.
Other Regulatory Matters. We and our subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to numerous examinations by federal and state banking regulators, as well as the SEC, FINRA, NASDAQ Stock Market, and various state insurance and securities regulators.
