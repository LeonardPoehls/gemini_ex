ITEM 1: Business
General

Shire plc and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as either “Shire”, or the “Company”) is the leading global biotechnology company focused on serving people with rare diseases and other highly specialized conditions.
The Company has grown both organically and through acquisition, completing a series of major transactions that have brought therapeutic, geographic and pipeline growth and diversification. The Company will continue to conduct its own research and development (“R&D”) focused on rare diseases, as well as evaluate companies, products and pipeline opportunities that offer a strategic fit and have the potential to deliver value to all of the Company’s stakeholders: patients, physicians, policy makers, payers, partners, investors and employees.
Strategy 
Shire's mission is to develop and deliver breakthrough therapies for the hundreds of millions of people in the world affected by rare diseases, and millions more with highly specialized conditions, who lack effective therapies to live their lives to the fullest.
The Company’s strategy is underpinned by four drivers:
Growth: 

• | Optimize marketed products (referred to as "Inline products") through commercial excellence;


• | advance late-stage pipeline and launch new products; and


• | accelerate growth through the acquisition of assets in core/adjacent therapeutic areas (“TAs”).

Innovation: 

• | Invest to develop novel therapies to treat diseases with significant unmet need;


• | expand rare disease expertise through internal research and collaborations with external partners; and


• | broaden the Company’s portfolio through targeting new indications.

Efficiency: 

• | Operate a lean and agile organization;


• | maintain focus on profitability while investing for future growth; and


• | retain flexibility to reinvest in high-growth opportunities.

People:

• | Foster and reward an entrepreneurial, high performance culture;


• | attract, develop and retain the best talent; and


• | live our values.

Business Model
The Company's products are available in more than 100 countries across core therapeutic areas including Hematology, Genetic Diseases, Neuroscience, Immunology, Internal Medicine and Ophthalmology; and a growing franchise in Oncology.
Shire leads its business through the Executive Committee, with support from its Inline Committee, Pipeline Committee and Corporate Committee, which comprise senior management from across functions and commercial units to support the Inline products, pipeline activities and other corporate and group related activity. The Executive Committee is responsible for ensuring the appropriate allocation of resources and focused decision making across the enterprise is in the best interests of Shire’s patients, shareholders and other stakeholders.
7

Shire's Inline Committee focuses exclusively on the commercial execution of its marketed products to ensure that the Company provides innovative treatments and services the needs of its customers and patients, as efficiently as possible. 
Shire’s Pipeline Committee focuses on advancing the pre-clinical and clinical development pipeline, which targets rare diseases and highly specialized conditions with high unmet need. This cross-functional committee ensures Shire explores and develops opportunities built upon its core capabilities, priority commercial franchises and also seeks to explore related and emerging areas. 
Shire's Corporate Committee provides oversight, input and decision-making for corporate cross-functional matters not covered by the Inline Committee and Pipeline Committee. 
Shire also fuels growth by the acquisition of new companies, in-licensing and new product development opportunities through R&D partnerships. Shire’s global corporate development team searches for new technologies, innovative products and strategic partnerships. The team engages in conversations with scientists and entrepreneurs on a global basis, while collaborating with commercial and R&D experts throughout the Company. 
Shire’s support functions, including Technical Operations, are unified across the business to run as efficiently and effectively as possible to support the Inline and Pipeline activities. 

2016 and Recent Highlights
On June 3, 2016, Shire completed its acquisition of Baxalta, a global innovative biopharmaceutical leader with a sustainable portfolio of differentiated therapies across many disease areas, including hematology, immunology and oncology, to create the global leader in rare diseases and highly specialized conditions.

HEMATOLOGY PRODUCTS
Treatments for Bleeding Disorders
Bleeding disorders affect the blood clotting (coagulation) process so that it does not work properly. As a result, people with bleeding disorders can bleed for longer than normal, and some may experience spontaneous bleeding into joints, muscles, or other parts of their bodies. Bleeding disorders range in severity from mild to severe and are usually inherited, though some can be developed.
The coagulation process involves blood platelets and a variety of proteins known as clotting factors. For individuals with bleeding disorders, these factors are produced at a lower level or can even be missing.
Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that affects approximately one in 10,000 people. According to the World Federation of Hemophilia Report on the Annual Global Survey 2014, there are an estimated identified 178,500 people living with hemophilia. There are a number of forms of the disease. The most common type is hemophilia A. This occurs when a person does not have enough clotting factor VIII (factor eight). Hemophilia B is less common. A person with hemophilia B does not have enough factor IX (factor nine). The result is the same for people with hemophilia A and B; that is, they bleed for a longer time than normal. Hemophilia is usually congenital but can be acquired. Acquired hemophilia is an autoimmune disorder. It occurs when the immune system produces antibodies that mistakenly attack clotting factors. 
Von Willebrand disease ("VWD") is a hereditary bleeding disorder that is caused by deficiency or dysfunction of von Willibrand factor ("VWF"), a plasma protein that mediates the initial adhesion of platelets at sites of vascular injury and also carries and protects factor VIII from premature proteolysis. Because of this, the blood does not clot properly, resulting in heavy menstrual periods, easy bruising, or frequent nose bleeds. It is estimated that one in 100 people, approximately three million people in the U.S., suffer from VWD.
Shire expects to continue to build on its leadership position with new therapies for bleeding disorders.
ADVATE
ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)] is a recombinant factor VIII ("rFVIII") therapy. ADVATE is a recombinant antihemophilic factor indicated for use in adults and children with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) for control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative management and routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes. It was approved in the U.S. in 2003 and the EU in 2004. It is currently approved in 69 countries worldwide. 
ADYNOVATE / ADYNOVI
ADYNOVATE/ADYNOVI is an extended half­life rFVIII treatment for hemophilia A based on ADVATE. ADYNOVATE/ADYNOVI uses the same manufacturing process as ADVATE and adds a proven technology, PEGylation (a chemical process that prolongs the amount of time a compound remains in circulation, potentially allowing for fewer injections), which Shire has exclusively licensed from Nektar Therapeutics. The U.S. patent covering the composition of matter for this technology has a protected expiry date of 2024, subject to potential patent­term extension as applicable. ADYNOVATE was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and in Japan in April 2016. It was approved under the name ADYNOVI in Switzerland in September 2016. The product is currently under regulatory review in the EU.
12

RIXUBIS
RIXUBIS [Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant)] was launched in the United States in 2013 for the treatment of hemophilia B. RIXUBIS is an injectable medicine used to replace U.C. clotting factor IX that is missing in people with hemophilia B. RIXUBIS was approved in the EU in December 2014 and Japan in February 2016. As of December 31, 2016, RIXUBIS was approved in 46 countries. 
Inhibitor Therapies
Inhibitors are a serious medical problem that can occur when a person with hemophilia has an immune response to treatment with clotting factor concentrates.  The immune system defends the body from harmful germs and viruses. Sometimes in the case of an inhibitor, a person's immune system reacts to proteins in factor concentrates as if they were harmful foreign substances because the body has never seen them before. When this happens, inhibitors (also called antibodies) form in the blood to fight against the foreign factor proteins. This stops the factor concentrates from being able to fix the bleeding problem.
Bleeding is very hard to control in someone with hemophilia who develops inhibitors. A person with inhibitors faces more bleeding and pain because treatment with factor concentrates is ineffective. In patients with persistent inhibitors, if bleeding into the muscles and joints is not controlled, permanent joint damage is likely.
For patients with sufficient access to care, treatment of inhibitors is one of the biggest challenges in hemophilia today. It is possible to get rid of inhibitors using a technique called immune tolerance induction. However, this type of treatment requires specialized medical expertise, is expensive, and takes a long time. Drugs called bypassing agents can be used to work around inhibitors and help blood clot.
FEIBA
FEIBA (Anti­Inhibitor Coagulant Complex) is a plasma­ based inhibitor bypass therapy, and is a leading inhibitor management therapy and is the only marketed bypassing agent approved for prophylactic use. FEIBA is indicated for use in hemophilia A and hemophilia B patients with inhibitors for control of spontaneous bleeding episodes, to cover surgical interventions and routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes. FEIBA was first approved in the U.S. in 1986, and as of December 31, 2016, was approved in 74 countries. In a number of markets (not the U.S.), FEIBA is also approved for acquired hemophilia.
Treatments for Von Willebrand Disease 
VONVENDI
VONVENDI is a recombinant von Willebrand factor ("VWF") and is used to replace the VWF the body is missing in von Willebrand disease. VONVENDI is a first in class recombinant factor and was approved by the FDA in December 2015, for on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in adults 18 years and above with VWD. VONVENDI can also be given independent of recombinant Factor VIII ("rFVIII"), based on patient need. This attribute allows for tailored treatment for patients who may not require additional FVIII.
Other Hematology Products
The Company has a number of other marketed products in the Hematology portfolio (e.g., HEMOFIL M, RECOMBINATE and IMMUNATE for hemophilia A, OBIZUR for acquired hemophilia A, PROTHROMPLEX TOTAL for acquired deficiency and congenital deficiency of coagulation factors, IMMUNINE for hemophilia B).
GENETIC DISEASES PRODUCTS
Treatments for Hereditary Angioedema ("HAE")
Hereditary Angioedema is a rare, debilitating genetic inflammatory condition, which causes episodes of swelling in the face, extremities, and gastrointestinal ("GI") tract and can be life threatening. It is estimated that 20-30% of patients afflicted by HAE in the U.S. and EU remain undiagnosed. 
13

CINRYZE
CINRYZE is a C1 esterase inhibitor therapy for routine prophylaxis against HAE attacks, also known as C1 inhibitor ("C1-INH") deficiency. CINRYZE is marketed and sold in the U.S. for routine prophylaxis against HAE attacks in adolescent and adult patients with HAE. CINRYZE has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA, providing it with 12 years of data exclusivity from the date of grant of registration given to innovator biologics in the U.S. under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("PPACA" or "ACA") from October 2008. In June 2011, marketing authorization in the EU was granted for CINRYZE in adults and adolescents with HAE for routine prevention, pre-procedure prevention and acute treatment of angioedema attacks. The approval also includes a self-administration option for appropriately trained patients. As of December 31, 2016, CINRYZE was approved in 36 countries.
FIRAZYR
FIRAZYR is a peptide-based therapeutic developed for the symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of HAE.
In July 2008, the EMA granted marketing authorization throughout the EU for the use of FIRAZYR for the symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of HAE, and in February 2011 approved FIRAZYR for self-administration after training in subcutaneous injection technique by a healthcare professional. In August 2011, the FDA granted marketing approval for FIRAZYR in the U.S. for treatment of acute attacks of HAE in adults aged 18 and older and, after injection training, patients may self-administer FIRAZYR. FIRAZYR has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by both the FDA and the EMA, providing it with up to seven and ten years market exclusivity in the U.S. and EU, respectively, from the date of the grant of the relevant marketing authorization. As of December 31, 2016, FIRAZYR was approved in 45 countries.
Treatments for Lysosomal Storage Diseases
Lysosomal storage diseases ("LSD") are a group of approximately 50 inherited metabolic diseases that are characterized by an abnormal build-up of various toxic materials in the body's cells.
A lysosome is a subcellular organelle found in nearly all types of cells that is responsible for the enzymatic digestion of macromolecules (e.g. lipids, glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharides). Lysosomal disorders are usually triggered when a particular enzyme is missing or exists in too small an amount to enable the complete breakdown of the macromolecules. When this happens, waste substances accumulate in the cell. Each LSD is characterized by the nature of the substances that accumulate and their effects on the body.
Enzyme replacement therapy ("ERT") is an approach to treating LSDs whereby patients are given the particular enzyme that is deficient or absent.
ELAPRASE
ELAPRASE is an enzyme replacement treatment for Hunter syndrome (also known as Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II or MPS II). Hunter syndrome is a rare, inherited genetic disorder mainly affecting males that interferes with the body's ability to break down and recycle waste substances. In patients with Hunter syndrome, cumulative build-up of GAGs in cells throughout the body interferes with the way certain tissues and organs function, leading to severe clinical complications and early mortality. The disease is estimated to affect approximately one in 162,000 males (Meikle et al, 1999).
ELAPRASE was approved by the FDA in July 2006 and granted marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in January 2007 for the long term treatment of patients with Hunter syndrome. ELAPRASE has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by both the FDA and the EMA. ELAPRASE also benefits from the 12 years of data exclusivity from the date of grant of registration given to innovator biologics in the U.S. under the ACA.
ELAPRASE received approval from the Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (“MHLW”) in Japan in October 2007. As part of an agreement with Genzyme, Genzyme manages the sales and distribution of ELAPRASE in Japan as well as certain other countries in the Asia Pacific region. As of December 31, 2016, ELAPRASE was approved in 70 countries.
14

REPLAGAL
REPLAGAL is an enzyme replacement marketed for the treatment of Fabry disease outside of the U.S. Fabry disease is a rare, inherited genetic disorder resulting from a deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which is involved in the breakdown of fats. Although the signs and symptoms of Fabry disease vary widely from patient to patient, the most common include severe pain of the extremities, impaired kidney function which often progresses to kidney failure, early heart disease, stroke and disabling gastrointestinal symptoms. The disease is estimated to affect one in 27,000 people (Spada et al, 2006).
REPLAGAL is a fully human alpha-galactosidase A protein made in a human cell line is designed to replace the deficient alpha-galactosidase A with an active enzyme to ameliorate certain clinical manifestations of Fabry disease.
In August 2001, REPLAGAL was granted marketing authorization in the EU. As of December 31, 2016, REPLAGAL was approved in 56 countries, excluding the U.S.
VPRIV
VPRIV is an enzyme replacement treatment for Type 1 Gaucher disease. Gaucher disease is a rare, inherited genetic disorder which results in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase. This enzymatic deficiency causes an accumulation of glucocerebroside, primarily in macrophages called Gaucher cells in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and other organs. The accumulation of glucocerebrosidase in Gaucher cells in the liver and spleen leads to organomegaly. Presence of Gaucher cells in the bone marrow and spleen leads to clinically significant anemia and thrombocytopenia. The disease is estimated to affect one in 40,000 individuals, with a higher incidence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Sidransky et al, 2010, and National Gaucher Foundation).
VPRIV was approved by the FDA in February 2010, for long term enzyme replacement therapy for patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease. The EMA approved the marketing authorization for the use of VPRIV in August 2010. VPRIV has been granted orphan drug status in the EU with up to ten years market exclusivity from August 2010. VPRIV also benefits from the 12 years of data exclusivity in the U.S. from the date of grant of registration given to innovator biologics under the ACA. As of December 31, 2016, VPRIV was approved in 53 countries.
NEUROSCIENCE PRODUCTS 
Treatments for ADHD
ADHD is a chronic neurobehavioral disorder that manifests as a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is more frequent and severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development. Although there is no cure for ADHD, there are accepted treatments that have been demonstrated to improve symptoms. Standard treatments include educational approaches, psychological therapies that may include behavior modification, and/or medication.
The worldwide prevalence of ADHD is estimated at 5.3% (Am J Psych. 2007). In the U.S., an estimated 11% (6.4 million) of U.S. school-aged children have been diagnosed with ADHD in their lifetime. The diagnosis rate is approximately 61% of prevalent patients being diagnosed and 66% of these patients being treated with pharmacologic treatment.
Recent data suggest that the prevalence of ADHD in adults is 4.4%, indicating that approximately 8 million adults in the U.S. have the disorder. Although recognition of ADHD in adults has grown in recent years, it remains vastly under-recognized and under-treated as only 10-25% of adults with the disorder are diagnosed and adequately treated (Paragraph 1, Page 16, ADHD in Adults & Children, Text Book by Adler, Spencer & Wilens).
According to IMS National Sales Perspective (“IMS NSP”), a leading global provider of business intelligence for the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, the U.S. ADHD market was valued at approximately $10.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016; this represents an increase of approximately 1.9% from the year ended December 31, 2015.
15

VYVANSE
VYVANSE is a stimulant for the treatment of ADHD, where the amino acid l-lysine is linked to d-amphetamine. VYVANSE is therapeutically inactive until metabolized in the body.
The FDA approved VYVANSE as a once-daily treatment for children aged six to 12 with ADHD in February 2007, for adults in April 2008 and for adolescents aged 13 to 17 in November 2010. In addition, VYVANSE became the first drug in its class to be approved by the FDA for maintenance treatment, having been approved both as a maintenance treatment in adults with ADHD in January 2012, and for maintenance treatment in pediatrics and adolescents aged six to 17 in April 2013. VYVANSE is available in the U.S. in seven dosage strengths: 10mg, 20mg, 30mg, 40mg, 50mg, 60mg and 70mg.
The product is approved and marketed in certain European countries, Australia, Canada and Latin America under a variety of trade names VYVANSE / VENVANSE / ELVANSE/ TYVENSE / VUXEN / ADUVANZ.
VYVANSE was also approved in the U.S. in January 2015 as the first and only treatment of moderate to severe BED in adults. BED is defined as recurring episodes (more than once weekly), for at least 3 months, of consuming a large amount of food in a short time, compared with others. Patients feel a lack of control during a binge eating episode and marked distress over their eating. They typically experience shame and guilt, among other symptoms, about their binge eating and may conceal the symptoms. Unlike people with other eating disorders, adults with BED do not routinely try to “undo” their excessive eating with extreme actions like purging or over-exercising. BED is the most common eating disorder in the U.S., affecting an estimated 2.8 million adults, according to a national survey (Crossrow N, Russo LJ, Ming EE, Witt EA, Victor TW, Wadden TA. Poster, APA 167th Annual Meeting, New York, NY, May 3 - 7, 2014). BED occurs in both men and women and is more common than anorexia and bulimia combined. BED can occur in normal, overweight, and obese adults, and is seen across racial and ethnic groups. VYVANSE was approved for the treatment of BED in Canada in October 2016.
Information about litigation proceedings regarding VYVANSE can be found in ITEM 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 25, Legal and Other Proceedings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

IMMUNOLOGY PRODUCTS
Treatments for Primary Immunodeficiency
Primary immunodeficiencies ("PID") are a group of more than 300 disorders in which part of the body's immune system is missing or does not function properly. Normally, the immune system protects the body from pathogenic microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which can cause infectious diseases. When any part of a person's immune system is absent or dysfunctional, the individuals are susceptible to infections, and it may take longer to recover from infections. When a defect in the immune system is inherited and genetically determined, it is called primary immunodeficiency. It is estimated that as many as six million children and adults may be affected by PI worldwide (Bousfiha AA et al. Primary immunodeficiency diseases worldwide now appear more common than previously thought. J Clin Immunol. 2013 Jan;33(1):1-7).

GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG
GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] is a liquid formulation of the antibody­replacement therapy immunoglobulin product. It was originally approved by the FDA in September 2005. GAMMAGARD LIQUID is used to treat patients with PID and adults with multifocal motor neuropathy ("MMN"). GAMMAGARD LIQUID is made from human plasma that is donated by healthy people and contains antibodies collected from these healthy people that replace the missing antibodies in PID patients. It can be administered either intravenously or subcutaneously. KIOVIG is the brand name used for GAMMAGARD LIQUID outside of the U.S. KIOVIG is approved in Europe for use by patients with PID and certain secondary immunodeficiencies, and for adults with MMN. As of December 31, 2016, GAMMAGARD LIQUID / KIOVIG was approved in 71 countries.
GAMMAGARD S/D 
GAMMAGARD S/D [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] is indicated for the treatment of PID in patients two years old and older. GAMMAGARD S/D is also indicated for prevention of bacterial infections in hypogammaglobulinemia and/or recurrent bacterial infections associated with B­cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ("CLL"), treatment of adult patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ("ITP") to increase platelet count and to prevent and/or control bleeding, and prevention of coronary artery aneurysms associated with Kawasaki Syndrome in pediatric patients. GAMMAGARD S/D is provided for patients who require a low IgA content in their IV treatment (IgA less than 1 ìg/mL in a 5% solution). GAMMAGARD S/D was initially approved in the U.S. in 1994. As of December 31, 2016, GAMMAGARD S/D was approved in 22 countries.
HYQVIA
HYQVIA [Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) with Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase] is a product consisting of human normal immunoglobulin ("IG") and recombinant human hyaluronidase (licensed from Halozyme). The IG provides the therapeutic effect and the recombinant human hyaluronidase facilitates the dispersion and absorption of the IG administered subcutaneously, increasing its bioavailability. The IG is a 10% solution that is prepared from human plasma consisting of at least 98% immunoglobulin G, which contains a broad spectrum of antibodies. HYQVIA is the only subcutaneous IG treatment for PID patients with a dosing regimen requiring only one infusion up to once per month and one injection site per infusion to deliver a full therapeutic dose of IG. HYQVIA is approved in Europe for use by patients with PID syndromes and myeloma or CLL with severe secondary hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections, and in the United States for adults with PID. HYQVIA was approved in Europe in May 2013 and the U.S. in September 2014. As of December 31, 2016, HYQVIA was approved in 33 countries.
CUVITRU
CUVITRU is an Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) ("IGSC"), 20% Solution indicated as replacement therapy for primary humoral immunodeficiency in adult and pediatric patients two years of age and older. CUVITRU is also indicated in the EU for the treatment of certain secondary immunodeficiencies. CUVITRU is the only 20% subcutaneous IG treatment option without proline and with the ability to infuse up to 60 mL (12 grams) per site and 60 mL per hour, per site as tolerated, resulting in fewer infusion sites and shorter infusion durations compared to other conventional subcutaneous IG treatments. CUVITRU was approved in the U.S. in September 2016. A decentralized procedure ("DCP") to support approval by 17 authorities in Europe was successfully completed in June 2016.
Biotherapeutic Products
Albumin Products
Human albumin, produced in the liver, is an essential protein found in human plasma and accounts for about 50%-60% of plasma proteins. The primary functions of albumin are to maintain intravascular oncotic pressure, serve as a free radical scavenger and to facilitate transportation of substances such as fatty acids, hormones, bile salt, bilirubin, metals, and therapeutic drugs. When plasma volume is drastically reduced, serum albumin supplementation can help restore the losses. The key indication of albumin is the restoration and maintenance of circulating blood volume in situations such as trauma, surgery, blood loss, hypoalbuminemia, and burn management.
17

FLEXBUMIN
FLEXBUMIN [Albumin (Human)] is available as a 5% and 25% solution. Both products are indicated for hypovolemia, hypoalbuminemia due to general causes and burns, and for use during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery as a component of the pump prime. FLEXBUMIN 25% is also indicated for hypoalbuminemia associated with adult respiratory distress syndrome ("ARDS") and nephrosis, and hemolytic disease of the newborn ("HDN"). FLEXBUMIN was first approved in the US in 2005. As of December 31, 2016, FLEXBUMIN was approved in 54 countries.
Other Immunology Products
Shire has a number of other marketed products in the Immunology portfolio including SUBCUVIA for primary immunodeficiency, ARALAST NP and GLASSIA NP for emphysema due to severe hereditary deficiency of alpha1- antitrypsin, CEPROTIN for congenital protein C deficiency and BUMINATE for hypovolemia and hypoalbuminemia.
INTERNAL MEDICINE PRODUCTS 
LIALDA/MEZAVANT
Ulcerative Colitis ("UC") was estimated to affect approximately 1.6 million patients in major markets (U.S. and EU (France, Germany, UK, Italy and Spain)) in 2017 according to Ulcerative Colitis: Decision Resources. UC is a serious chronic inflammatory disease of the colon in which part or all of the large intestine becomes inflamed and often ulcerated. Typically, patients go through periods of relapse and remission and can suffer from diarrhea, bleeding and abdominal pain. Once diagnosis is confirmed, patients are usually treated for life. The first line treatment for UC is mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid (“5-ASA”)) based products.
LIALDA is the first and only FDA-approved once-daily, oral formulation of mesalamine indicated for the induction of remission in patients with mild to moderately active UC and for the maintenance of remission of UC. Initially approved for induction of remission in 2007, the maintenance indication was added in 2011. LIALDA contains the highest commercially available mesalamine dose per tablet (1.2g), so patients can take as few as two tablets once daily. LIALDA is marketed in certain territories outside the U.S. by Shire under the trade name MEZAVANT and MEZAVANT XL. As of December 31, 2016, LIALDA/MEZAVANT was commercially available in 24 countries either directly or through distributor arrangements. 
Litigation proceedings relating to the Company’s LIALDA patents are in progress. Information about litigation proceedings regarding LIALDA can be found in ITEM 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 25, Legal and Other Proceedings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
GATTEX/REVESTIVE
GATTEX/REVESTIVE (teduglutide [rDNA origin]) for injection is the first prescription medicine for the long-term treatment of adults with short bowel syndrome ("SBS") who are dependent on parenteral support. SBS is a condition in which a large portion of the intestine has been removed by surgery. As a result, people cannot absorb enough nutrients or fluids from food and liquids to maintain good health. SBS can also be caused by disease or injury that prevents the small intestine from functioning properly despite normal length. To make up for the inadequate absorption, intravenous (“IV”) feeding (parenteral support) may be prescribed to help the patient stay healthy. In the U.S., approximately 6,000 to 7,000 SBS patients are dependent on parenteral support with a similar prevalence in Europe (NA HPEN Patient Registry. Oley Foundation.1994). GATTEX / REVESTIVE may help the remaining intestine absorb more nutrients and reduce the need for parenteral support. GATTEX was approved by the FDA in December 2012. REVESTIVE was approved in the EU in August 2012. As of December 31, 2016, GATTEX / REVESTIVE was launched in the U.S., Canada, Sweden, Germany, Norway, France, Austria, Finland and Switzerland.
NATPARA/NATPAR
NATPARA (parathyroid hormone) for injection is indicated as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism ("HPT"). HPT is a rare condition in which the parathyroid glands fail to produce sufficient amounts of parathyroid hormone (“PTH”) or where the PTH lacks biologic activity. In patients with HPT, insufficient levels of PTH lead to many physiological abnormalities, including low serum calcium and an inability to convert native vitamin D into its active state to properly absorb dietary calcium. Acute symptoms of HPT are largely due to low serum calcium and range from muscle pain and tingling, to lack of focus or ability to concentrate, and anxiety 
18

and depression. In extreme cases, life-threatening events, such as arrhythmias and seizures, may occur. In the U.S., approximately 75,000 patients are diagnosed with HPT with 41,000 having moderate to severe disease with a similar prevalence in EU5. [J Bone Miner Res. 2013 Dec;28 (12):2570-6].
NATPARA was approved by the FDA in January 2015. NATPARA has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA. NATPARA also benefits from the 12 years of data exclusivity from the date of registration given to innovator biologics in the U.S. under the ACA.
NATPARA carries a boxed warning that bone cancer (osteosarcoma) has been observed in rat studies with NATPARA. It is unknown whether NATPARA causes osteosarcoma in humans, but because of a potential risk of osteosarcoma, NATPARA is only recommended for use in patients whose hypocalcemia cannot be controlled on calcium supplementation and active forms of vitamin D, and for whom the potential benefits are considered to outweigh this potential risk. NATPARA is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") program.
The Marketing Approval Application ("MAA") for NATPAR (parathyroid hormone (rDNA)) has been validated by the EMA and is currently under review. The EMA granted orphan drug designation for NATPAR in January 2014.

The Company has a number of other marketed products in the Internal Medicine portfolio (e.g., XAGRID/AGRYLIN for essential thrombocythemia, RESOLOR for chronic constipation, CARBATROL for epilepsy, REMINYL for dementia, PLENADREN for adrenal insufficiency, FOSRENOL for hyperphosphatemia in end stage renal disease and PENTASA for ulcerative colitis).
ONCOLOGY PRODUCTS
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ("ALL")
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a rare, fast-growing cancer of the white blood cells, with approximately 5,000 new cases each year in the United States, and 4,000 in Europe. The disease is the most common childhood cancer and is responsible for more than 80% of childhood leukemia cases. The five-year pediatric survival rate has climbed to 80% with modern therapies.
ONCASPAR
ONCASPAR (pegaspargase) is approved in the U.S. and EU as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the first-line treatment of patients with ALL. As of December 31, 2016, ONCASPAR was approved in 37 countries.
Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of the pancreas when abnormal cells within the pancreas grow out of control and form a tumor. It spreads rapidly and is seldom detected in its early stages, making it a leading cause of cancer death. It was the seventh leading cause of cancer deaths in 2012, and it is estimated that pancreatic cancer will become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide by 2030 (Rahib L, Smith B, Aizenberg R, et al. Projecting Cancer Incidence and Deaths to 2030: The Unexpected Burden of Thyroid, Liver, and Pancreas Cancers in the United States. American Association for Cancer Research; 2014).
ONIVYDE
ONIVYDE (pegylated liposomal formulation of irinotecan) is approved in the U.S. and EU in combination with fluorouracil ("5-FU") and leucovorin ("LV"), for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine based therapy. As of December 31, 2016, ONIVYDE was approved in 32 countries.
Shire is responsible for the development and commercialization of ONIVYDE outside of the U.S. and Taiwan under an exclusive licensing agreement with Merrimack. Shire pays Merrimack tiered royalties on ONIVYDE net sales. Merrimack markets ONIVYDE in the United States. PharmaEngine holds the commercialization rights in Taiwan.

OPHTHALMOLOGY PRODUCTS 
XIIDRA
XIIDRA (lifitegrast ophthalmic solution) 5%, a twice-daily eye drop solution, was approved by the FDA in July 2016 for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. 
Dry eye disease is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface. It is diagnosed by an eye care professional based on patient reported symptoms, such as eye dryness, overall eye discomfort, stinging, burning, a gritty feeling or fluctuating blurry vision, as well as signs, which can be objectively evaluated by an eye care professional through various tests to determine the presence of dry eye disease. The symptoms of dry eye can interrupt daily activities such as reading, driving, working, using technology, watching TV, and spending time outside in bright light and cold or windy conditions. Aging and gender (female) are recognized as traditional risk factors of dry eye disease while modern risk factors include prolonged digital/computer screen time, contact lens wear and cataract or refractive surgery. Dry eye is an often chronic ocular disease associated with inflammation that may eventually lead to damage to the surface of the eye. Dry eye may be progressive and is a common patient complaint to eye care professionals. XIIDRA is the only prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of both signs and symptoms of this condition.

PIPELINE
Among the products, therapies and projects in Shire’s pipeline are the following, grouped by development status as of December 31, 2016:
22

Products in Registration
Hematology
ADYNOVATE/ADYNOVI for the treatment of hemophilia A
ADYNOVATE/ADYNOVI is a PEGylated rFVIII, considered as lead candidate of the rFVIII EHL (extended half-life) program. ADYNOVATE/ADYNOVI is considered a next-generation ADVATE molecule with improved pharmacokinetic properties, to provide hemophilia A patients on prophylaxis with another option built on the proven ADVATE molecule. Phase 2/3 has been completed, followed by approval and first product launch in the U.S. (fourth quarter of 2015) and then Japan (second quarter of 2016). An application was filed with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in March 2016 and the Company received feedback from the EMA in July 2016. Shire has responded to the Day 120 questions and is proactively preparing for the agency response.
Neuroscience
SHP465 for the treatment of ADHD
SHP465 is a once daily long acting, triple-bead, mixed amphetamine salt product for oral administration. The product was developed for the treatment of ADHD. The SHP465 NDA was originally submitted to the FDA in 2006, an approvable letter was received in 2007 and the project was placed on hold. In 2014, the project was reactivated and a plan was agreed with the FDA to allow a Class 2 resubmission, which is a category of resubmission that involves a six month review cycle due to the inclusion of large amounts of new information and significant FDA review. In April 2016, Shire announced positive topline results of the SHP465 safety and efficacy study in ADHD. In June 2016, Shire announced positive topline results of the SHP465 efficacy and safety study in adults with ADHD. Shire filed a Class 2 resubmission of the NDA with the FDA in December 2016.
INTUNIV for the treatment of ADHD in Japan
Under a collaboration agreement, Shionogi and Shire are co-developing and will sell treatments for ADHD in Japan, including INTUNIV. A Phase 3 clinical program to evaluate the efficacy and safety of INTUNIV in Japanese patients aged six to 17 has been completed and submission of the INTUNIV MAA in Japan was made in January 2016.
Internal Medicine
NATPAR/NATPARA for the treatment of HPT
NATPAR is currently under review in Europe as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with HPT. NATPARA was approved by the FDA in January 2015.
Phase 3 
Hematology
VONVENDI for the treatment of von Willebrand disease
VONVENDI is the first recombinant therapy providing a pure von Willebrand disease factor with customized dosing. The Company received U.S. regulatory approval in December 2015 and the product was broadly available in the U.S. in late 2016. A surgery clinical study, which is required for filing in Europe, was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.
OBIZUR (CHAWI SURGERY) for patients with congenital hemophilia A with inhibitors undergoing surgery
OBIZUR is a recombinant porcine sequence FVIII ("rpFVIII"), from which major parts of the B-domain have been deleted (BDD). OBIZUR is sufficiently similar to human FVIII in promoting hemostasis and for monitoring the FVIII levels and different enough in structure to render it less susceptible to inactivation by circulating inhibitory antibodies to human FVIII. Patients with inhibitors are at risk of perioperative bleeding complications, presenting therapeutic challenges in elective or emergency surgery. The CHAWI surgery study was initiated in July 2016 and enrollment is ongoing. This is an important trial as patients with inhibitors are at risk of perioperative bleeding complications, 
23

presenting therapeutic challenges in elective or emergency surgery and also some patients don’t respond well to bypassing agents due to the unreliability with which hemostasis can be achieved and maintained.
Neuroscience
LDX for the treatment of ADHD in Japan
LDX is currently marketed as VYVANSE in the U.S. and ELVANSE in certain countries in the EU for the treatment of ADHD. Shionogi and Shire are co-developing and will sell ADHD products in Japan, including LDX. A Phase 2/3 clinical program to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LDX in Japanese patients aged six to 17 was completed. Shire plans to submit a MAA in Japan for LDX during the first half of 2017.
SHP609 for the treatment of Hunter syndrome with CNS symptoms
SHP609 is in development as an enzyme replacement therapy (“ERT”) delivered intrathecally for the treatment of Hunter syndrome patients with early cognitive impairment. Hunter syndrome is a Lysosomal Storage Disorder.  In December 2014, the FDA granted SHP609 Fast Track Designation. In addition, this product has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. The Company has initiated a pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial which completed enrollment in September 2016. The extension study is ongoing.
Immunology
SHP643 for the treatment of HAE
SHP643 is a Phase 3 novel long-acting human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein ("pKal"). SHP643 has received Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Orphan Drug Designations by the FDA and received Orphan Drug Designation in the EU. Shire’s Phase 3 clinical trial (HELP study) enrollment was completed in September 2016.
FIRAZYR (icatibant) for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE in Japan
The final results of the Phase 3 Japan study demonstrated that the efficacy and safety profile of FIRAZYR for the acute treatment of HAE attacks was similar between Japanese patients and those patients who participated in Shire’s previously conducted Phase 3 program. Shire is planning to file a JNDA in 2017 for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE.
SHP616 (CINRYZE SC) life cycle management
Shire is pursuing a subcutaneous formulation of CINRYZE for routine prophylaxis against HAE attacks in adolescent and adult patients. An Investigational New Drug application ("IND") was submitted in October 2015, and Shire completed enrollment in a Phase 3 study in December 2016.
SHP616 (CINRYZE) for routine prophylaxis and treatment of acute attacks in adolescent and adult patients with HAE in Japan
CINRYZE is indicated in the U.S. for prophylaxis and in the EU for both prophylaxis and acute treatment of angioedema attacks in adolescent and adult patients with HAE. Based on feedback from the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”), a Clinical Trial Notification (“CTN”) was resubmitted with inclusion of self-administration in 2016 and the Phase 3 clinical trial began enrolling subjects in September 2016. 
SHP616 (CINRYZE) for the treatment of Antibody Mediated Rejection
A Phase 2 study for the treatment of Antibody Mediated Rejection (“AMR”) with SHP616 was completed. Shire has received FDA and EMA feedback and submitted an IND in the second quarter of 2015. The FDA granted Fast Track Designation for SHP616 in October 2015 and Shire continues enrollment in a Phase 3 study for the treatment of acute AMR. 
24

HYQVIA for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy ("CIDP")
Shire is undertaking efforts to expand indications for HYQVIA, including for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, a neurological disorder characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the legs and arms.

Internal Medicine
SHP647 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease ("IBD")
SHP647 is a fully human IgG2k anti-monoclonal antibody that binds to human mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule ("MAdCAM") and thereby is a novel, once-monthly, selective inhibitor of the gut-specific leukocyte adhesion process delivered by subcutaneous injection. By targeting a unique, gut-specific endothelial adhesion molecule the asset provides a more selective and potentially safer approach to reducing inflammation associated with IBD. Phase II studies in Ulcerative Colitis ("UC") and Crohn’s disease ("CD") were completed and showed, especially in UC, strong signs of efficacy. Shire is actively working with regulatory authorities to validate plans for the Phase 3 program. 
Neuroscience
SHP607 for the prevention of certain complications of prematurity
SHP607 is a 1:1 complex of two recombinant human proteins: insulin-like growth factor 1 ("rhIGF-1") and IGF binding protein 3 ("rhIGFBP-3"). Through continuous IV infusion, SHP-607 is designed to replace low endogenous levels of IGF-1 due to premature birth. The program completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in early 2016, in which it assessed the safety and efficacy of the drug product in infants born before 28 weeks. SHP607 did not meet its primary endpoint of reducing the severity of retinopathy of prematurity ("ROP"), a rare eye condition. The study, however, demonstrated clinically relevant effects in secondary endpoints related to the development of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia ("BPD"), a chronic lung disease, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage ("IVH"), a type of brain injury, both of which have lifelong negative implications for normal development. Shire is working with regulatory authorities on the Phase 2b/3 program.

SHP631 has received Orphan Drug Designation from both the FDA and the EMA. In the second quarter of 2015, ArmaGen initiated a Phase 1 sequential, open-label, dose escalation, multi-dose study in 
27

adults with Hunter syndrome.  In July 2016, ArmaGen announced the presentation of data from the first cohort of four adult patients. The data have supported a recommendation by an independent data monitoring committee to proceed to the study’s second cohort.

Collaborative and Other Licensing Arrangements
The Company routinely enters into certain collaborative and licensing arrangements. In some of these arrangements, Shire and the collaboration partner are both actively involved in the development and commercialization of the licensed product and have exposure to risks and rewards dependent on its commercial success.
Generally, through in-licensing arrangements, the Company has licensed certain product or intellectual property rights for consideration such as up-front payments, development milestones, sales milestones and/or royalty payments. 
Out-licensing arrangements generally provide for commercialization rights to a product or products being developed by the counterparty, and in exchange often result in an upfront payment upon execution of the agreement and obligations that the counterparty make specified future development, regulatory approval or commercial milestone payments as well as royalty payments.

The Company manages the risks associated with reliance on single sources of API by carrying additional inventories or 
29

developing second sources of supply.
CINRYZE API is derived from human plasma sourced from commercial plasma suppliers. The sourcing of plasma and the production of products derived from plasma are regulated extensively by the FDA, the EMA and other medical product and health care regulatory agencies. For CINRYZE, Shire relies on a combination of sources for plasma including long term supply agreements and periodic “spot purchases” of plasma from third party plasma suppliers.

From there, the Company primarily distributes its products: VYVANSE, INTUNIV, ADDERALL XR, LIALDA, PENTASA, FOSRENOL and XAGRID to the U.S. market through the three major wholesalers who have hub or distribution centers that stock Schedule II drugs in the U.S., providing access to nearly all pharmacies in the U.S.
The distribution and warehousing of products: REPLAGAL, ELAPRASE, VPRIV, NATPARA, GATTEX and FIRAZYR for the U.S. market are contracted out to specialist third party contractors.
Outside of the U.S., physical distribution of Company’s products is either contracted out to third parties (where the Company has local operations) or facilitated via distribution agreements (where the Company does not have local operations).
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

Shire purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world, including in the U.S. While efforts are made to diversify Shire’s source of components and materials, in certain instances Shire acquires components and materials from a sole supplier.

Human plasma is a critical raw material in Shire’s business. The Company believes that its ability to internally and externally source plasma represents a distinctive and flexible infrastructure, which provides the Company a unique capability with respect to the consistent delivery of high quality plasma-based products. Shire owns and operates plasma collection facilities in the U.S. and Austria through its wholly owned subsidiary BioLife Plasma Services L.P. ("BioLife"). BioLife operates and maintains more than 80 plasma collection facilities in 24 states throughout the U.S. and at seven locations in Austria. Shire also maintains relationships with other plasma suppliers to ensure that it retains 
30

the flexibility to meet market demand for its plasma based therapies.

Material customers

Shire’s three largest trade customers are AmerisourceBergen, McKesson Corp and Cardinal Health, Inc., which are based in the U.S. In 2016, these wholesale customers accounted for approximately 16%, 12% and 10% of Product sales, respectively.

Intellectual Property

An important part of the Company’s business strategy is to protect its products and technologies through the use of patents and trademarks, to the extent available. The Company also relies on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third parties to maintain and enhance its competitive position. The Company’s commercial success will depend, in part, upon its ability to obtain and enforce strong patents, to maintain trade secret protection, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to comply with the terms of licenses granted to it. The Company’s policy is to seek patent protection for proprietary technology whenever possible in the U.S., Canada, major European countries and Japan. Where practicable, the Company seeks patent protection in other countries on a selective basis. In all cases, the Company endeavors to either obtain patent protection itself or support patent applications by its licensors. 
Regulatory exclusivity can also provide meaningful protection for the Company’s products. Although the World Trade Organization's agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights ("TRIPS") requires signatory countries to provide regulatory exclusivity to innovative pharmaceutical products, implementation and enforcement varies widely from country to country. The markets for some of the Company’s currently marketed and potential future products, such as those for rare diseases, are small and where possible the Company has sought and will seek orphan drug designation for products directed to these markets which, if granted, provides regulatory exclusivity for seven years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU from the date of product approval (see “Government Regulation” below).
In the regular course of business, the Company’s patents may be challenged by third parties. The Company is a party to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights. Details of ongoing litigation are provided in ITEM 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 25, Legal and Other Proceedings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The degree of patent protection afforded to pharmaceutical inventions around the world is uncertain. If patents are granted to other parties that contain claims having a scope that is interpreted by the relevant authorities to cover any of the Company’s products or technologies, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain licenses to such patents or make other arrangements at reasonable cost, if at all.
The existence, scope and duration of patent protection varies among the Company’s products and among the different countries where the Company’s products may be sold. They may also change over the course of time as patents are granted or expire, or become extended, modified or revoked. The following table shows the patent numbers that are listed in the Patent and Exclusivity Information Addendum of the FDA’s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the “Orange Book”), for some of the Company’s more significant, revenue-generating products approved via an NDA or an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that references a previously approved drug , which are owned by or licensed to the Company and relevant to an understanding of the Company’s business taken as a whole. There may be other patents related to these products, methods of manufacturing, or use of the products in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions that are not listed in the Orange Book. Some of the Company’s other products are biologics which are protected by patents and forms of unpatented confidential information, including manufacturing trade secrets and proprietary know-how, that are not listed in the Orange Book. In addition, expiration dates set forth below do not necessarily reflect possible changes to the patent term afforded by, among other things, patent term extensions in the U.S. or other territories or changes that may result as a consequence of the outcome of litigation or other proceedings. The Company also holds patents in other jurisdictions, such as the EU, Canada and Japan, and has patent applications pending in such jurisdictions, as well as in the U.S.

Competition

Shire believes that competition in its markets is based on, among other things, product safety, efficacy, convenience of dosing, reliability, availability and price. Companies with more resources and larger R&D expenditures than Shire have a greater ability to acquire assets as well as fund the research and clinical trials necessary for regulatory applications, and consequently may have a better chance of obtaining approval of drugs that would then compete with Shire’s products. Other products now in use or being developed by others may be more effective or have fewer side effects than the Company’s current or future products.

33

Shire’s share of the U.S. ADHD prescription market in December 2016 was 16.8% (compared to 16.7% in December 2015). Overall the U.S. ADHD prescription market grew by 5.6% in the year ended December 31, 2016 (compared to 5.8% in the same period in 2015).
Generic immediate release stimulants which constitute 34.6% of the ADHD market (IMS NPA, MAT December 2016) are showing strong growth in the U.S. ADHD market, growing 8.7% in the 12 months ended December 2016 in comparison to the 12 months ended December 2015.
Shire’s key ADHD market is the U.S., with the Company having three products for the treatment of ADHD (VYVANSE, ADDERALL XR and INTUNIV). Shire also has ADHD products launched in Canada, Brazil, Australia, South Korea, Israel and selected EU markets. Further geographic expansion plans are underway, with VYVANSE approved in Mexico and a collaboration agreement with Shionogi to co-develop and sell VYVANSE and INTUNIV in Japan.
Key branded competitors in the U.S. are stimulants CONCERTA (Janssen), APTENSIO XR (Rhodes), EVEKEO (Arbor) and QUILLIVANT (Pfizer), a liquid methylphenidate.
Key competitors in the European ADHD market are CONCERTA (Janssen-Cilag), RITALIN LA (Novartis), MEDIKINET (Medice and distributors) and STRATTERA (Lilly), depending upon the country. According to IMS Midas the EU 2016 market size was approximately $486 million (moving annual total (“MAT”) November 2016), with annual growth of 8.0% compared to the same period in 2015 of $450 million. During that same period VYVANSE grew by 47% ($75 million vs $51 million).
The Company is also aware of several clinical development programs underway by other pharmaceutical companies.

Internal Medicine 
Ulcerative Colitis market
UC is a type of inflammatory bowel disease. The first-line treatments for patients with mild to moderate UC are formulations containing mesalamine ("5-ASA"). Shire defines the 5-ASA competitive set as the non-sulfasalazine, oral mesalamine and mesalamine pro-drug products.
Competitors vary across markets. Principal competitors in major markets include DELZICOL, ASACOL and ASACOL HD/ASACOL 800 (Allergan, Tillots and various other licensees), APRISO (Valeant), PENTASA (marketed by Ferring Pharmaceutical, outside of the U.S. only), SALOFALK (Dr. Falk) and CLAVERSAL (Faes Farma, Recordati S.p.A).
5-ASA products are generally protected by formulation patents only. In December 2007, several generic versions of Valeant’s COLAZAL (balsalazide) entered the U.S. market, but no other generic versions of products in the oral 5-ASA competitive set have been introduced to the U.S. market since that time. Generic mesalamine products are available in several European markets, but are not significant competitors in those markets. UCERIS (budesonide) was approved by the FDA in January 2013 and represents an alternative to 5-ASA products for acute treatment (up to eight weeks) of mild to moderate UC.
The Company is aware of other 5-ASA and non-ASA based treatments in development for UC. While the former include drug candidates from Mylan, Zydus and other companies, a number of competitors focus on the development of TNF-alpha inhibitors (e.g. flixabi by Samsung/Bioepis, amjevita by Amgen, inflectra by Pfizer) integrin inhibitors (e.g. etrolizumab by Roche), IL-12/IL-23 inhibitors (e.g. ustekinumab by J&J) and JAK inhibitors (e.g. tofacitinib by Pfizer and upadacitinib by Abbvie).
Short Bowel Syndrome Market
GATTEX competes in the U.S. with EMD/Serono's ZORBTIVE (somatotropin) and Emmaus LifeSciences' NUTRESTORE (L-glutamine). REVESTIVE is the only product approved to treat SBS in Europe. Shire is aware of the development of certain compounds to treat SBS by Zealand Pharma and Naia Ltd.
Hypoparathyroid Market
NATPARA competes against calcium and vitamin D and occasionally Lilly’s Forteo (teriparatide, PTH1-34) prescribed off-label. Shire is aware of the development of compounds to treat hypoparathyroidism by EnteraBio and Chugai.
Oncology 
ONIVYDE
ONIVYDE is indicated for the treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, in combination with 5-fluorouracil ("5-FU") and leucovorin ("LV"), in adult patients who have progressed following gemcitabine-based therapy. There are currently no combinations or single agent that are the approved “standard of care” in the second or third line setting.  The combination therapy used prior to ONIVYDE’s approval all contained generics.  

Shire is aware of a number of products in development as second line therapy for pancreatic cancer. These include Astra Zenaca’s LYNPARZA which targets patients with a gBRCA mutation (less than 5% of pancreatic cancer patients), Taiho’s TAS-118 and Eleison’s glufosfamide.
ONCASPAR

ONCASPAR is pegylated asparaginase indicated as a component of a multi agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with first line acute lymphoblastic leukemia ("ALL") and patients that are hypersensitive to native asparaginase. In certain markets, native asparaginases derived from E. Coli may still be used. ONCASPAR is likely to compete with Medac’s SPECTRILA, a recombinant version of asparaginase which was recently approved in the EU.

35

Shire is aware of a number of products in development for first line ALL including Jazz’s ERWINASE/ERWINAZE, and Erytech’s GRASPA. There are also a number of biosimilars in preclinical development.
Ophthalmology
Dry eye disease
XIIDRA is the only prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in the U.S. XIIDRA competes against Allergan's RESTASIS (a prescription topical immunomodulator indicated to increase tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and various over the counter artificial tear products. Shire is aware of a number of products in development for the treatment of dry eye disease, including Allergan’s MIM-D3 and RegeneRx’s RGN-259.
Government Regulation

The clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of Shire’s products is subject to significant governmental regulation in the U.S., the EU and other territories. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, the Public Health Service Act and other laws and regulations in the U.S., as well as numerous directives and guidelines in the EU, govern the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising and promotion of the Company’s products. Product development and approval within these regulatory frameworks takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are also inspected regularly by the FDA.
In general, pharmaceutical and biotechnology products must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Clinical trials for new products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the product into healthy human volunteers, the emphasis is on testing for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology. Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Once a product is found to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken with a larger number of patients to provide enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product and to evaluate more fully clinical outcomes. The failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of a product under development can delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product.
In order to gain marketing approval the Company must submit to the relevant regulatory authority for review information on the quality (chemistry, manufacturing and pharmaceutical) aspects of the product as well as the non-clinical and clinical data. The FDA undertakes this review for the U.S. In the EU the review may be undertaken by the following: (i) members of the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use as part of a centralized procedure; (ii) an individual country's regulatory agency, followed by “mutual recognition” of this review by a number of other countries' agencies, depending on the process applicable to the product in question; or (iii) a competent member state’s regulatory agency through a decentralized procedure, an alternative authorization procedure to the “mutual recognition” procedure.
Approval can take several months to several years, or be denied. The approval process can be affected by a number of factors. For example, additional studies or clinical trials may be requested during the review and may delay marketing approval and involve unbudgeted costs. After approval for the initial indication, further clinical studies are usually necessary to gain approval for any additional indications. The terms of any approval, including labelling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product.
As a condition of approval, the regulatory agency will require that the product continues to meet regulatory requirements as to quality, safety and efficacy and will require strict procedures to monitor and report any adverse effects. Where adverse effects occur or may occur, the regulatory agency may require additional studies or changes to the labelling (for example, application of a “black box” warning). Compelling new “adverse” data may result in a product approval being withdrawn at any stage following review by an agency and discussion with the Company.
Some jurisdictions, including the EU and the U.S., may designate products for disease treatment within a relatively small patient population as orphan drugs. Generally, if a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently 
36

receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that applications to market the same product for the same indication may not be approved, except in limited circumstances, for a period of up to ten years in the EU and for up to seven years in the U.S. A key provision of 21st Century Cures initiative, as specifically codified in the 21st Century Cures Act, is the Rare Pediatric Disease ("RPD") Priority Review Voucher ("PRV"). The RPD PRV program provides a voucher for a six-month FDA priority review for any product that receives successful approval as an orphan drug to treat a rare pediatric disease. These laws are particularly pertinent to Shire’s rare disease products.
In the U.S., the Drug Price Competition and Patent Restoration Term Act of 1984, known as the U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act, established a period of marketing exclusivity for brand-name drugs as well as abbreviated application procedures for generic versions of those drugs. Once the applicable exclusivity period for the brand-name drug has expired (which may range from three to five years), generic manufacturers may file with the FDA for approval to manufacture and market generic versions of the brand-name drug. Approval is sought by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”). As a substitute for conducting full-scale pre-clinical and clinical studies, the FDA can accept data establishing that the drug formulation, which is the subject of an abbreviated application, is bio-equivalent and has the same therapeutic effect as the previously approved drug, among other requirements. EU legislation also contains data exclusivity provisions. All medicinal products will be subject to an “8+2+1” exclusivity regime. A generic company may file a marketing authorization application for that product with the health authorities referencing the innovator’s data eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product. The generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 (8+2) or 11 years (8+2+1) have elapsed from the date of grant of the initial marketing authorization. The one-year extension is available if the innovator obtains an additional indication during the first eight years of the marketing authorization that is of significant advancement in clinical benefit. While the U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act addresses the development and entrance of generic products, the ACA amended the Public Health Service Act to create an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” to or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed biological product. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 allow for approval of a biosimilar if data substantiates that the product is “highly similar” to an approved and existing biological product. Similar to a non-biologic product, an interchangeable biological product may be substituted for the reference product by a pharmacist without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product.
In the U.S., the DEA regulates the national production and distribution of scheduled drugs (i.e. those drugs containing controlled substances) by allocating production quotas based, in part, upon the DEA’s view of national demand. As scheduled drugs, the production and distribution of Shire’s stimulant ADHD products (ADDERALL XR, VYVANSE and EQUASYM) are strictly controlled and supply of active ingredient is dependent on the DEA’s permitted annual quotas and its willingness to update those quotas to meet any shortage of drugs.
The branch of the FDA responsible for product marketing oversight routinely reviews company marketing practices and also may impose pre-clearance requirements on materials intended for use in marketing of approved drug products. Shire is subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Similar review and regulation of advertising and marketing practices exists in the other geographic areas where the company operates.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a company failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, such as issuing an FDA Form 483 notice of inspectional observations, a warning letter, an untitled letter, imposing civil money penalties, suspending or delaying issuance of approvals, requiring product recall, imposing a total or partial shutdown of production, withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted, pursuing product seizures, consent decrees or other injunctive relief, or criminal prosecution through the Department of Justice. The FDA can require a Company to repair, replace or refund the cost of products that the Company manufactured or distributed. Outside the U.S., regulatory agencies may exert a range of similar powers.
The Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, major government payers for the elderly, disabled and poor in the U.S., respectively. Shire is subject to various mandated discounts and rebates, as well as compliance requirements, in order to participate in these programs. HHS will be interpreting, implementing and enforcing manufacturers’ compliance with rebate payments, discounts and mandated price reporting changes under the PPACA.

Regulatory Developments

In the U.S., various legislative proposals at the federal and state levels could bring about major changes in the affected health care systems. Some states have passed such legislation, and further federal and state proposals are possible. Such proposals and legislation include, and future proposals could include, price controls, patient access constraints to medicines, cost sharing through improved patient health outcomes, abbreviated licensure pathway for biosimilars and increases in required rebates or discounts. Similar initiatives exist in the EU. The Company cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives, but will work to maintain patient access to its products and to oppose price constraints. Additionally, legislation is being debated at the federal and state level in the U.S. that could allow patient access to drugs approved in other countries, most notably Canada. This is generally referred to as drug re-importation. Although there is substantial opposition to this potential legislation within areas of the federal government, including the FDA, the Company cannot predict the outcome of such legislative activities. Several local U.S. jurisdictions, including the King County of Washington State and Alameda, San Francisco and San Mateo Counties in California, have imposed drug-disposal responsibilities and fees on drug manufacturers. Depending on the outcome of court cases and the ability of other municipalities to pass similar ordinances, these additional costs of doing business in the U.S. may extend to other localities. 
Furthermore, several agencies in the U.S., including the Office of Inspector General, Department of Justice and DEA have been stepping up their enforcement activities as part of the ACA, leading to the imposition of an increasing number of Corporate Integrity Agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as part of ultimate settlements.
Aggressive drug price actions taken in the U.S. by various manufacturers over the last several years has precipitated a media maelstrom and reinvigorated a hypersensitive atmosphere regarding the cost of drugs charged by manufacturers. While it is uncertain whether the U.S. Federal government will implement price controls in the near or midterm time frame, multiple states have proposed price control legislation and transparency initiatives. Though several states have been unsuccessful with passing legislation (e.g., CA, NC, NY, OR, PA), on June 2, 2016, Vermont passed into law Vermont S. 216 which includes provisions designed to increase prescription drug cost transparency. There is a high probability that new legislation will be proposed in 2017 from both a state (CO, MA, MN, NY, NC, OR, PA, RI, VA and WA) and federal perspective. Despite the attention on price increases, historically Shire has taken a responsible approach to price increases.
Similar regulatory and legislative considerations are encountered in Europe and other international markets where governments regulate pharmaceutical prices and patient reimbursement levels. The differing approach to price regulation has led to some parallel trade within the EU where Shire’s products are imported into markets with higher prices from markets with lower prices. Exploitation of price differences between countries in this way can adversely impact domestic sales in those markets with higher prices.
Ethics and Compliance
In order to maintain compliance with the laws and regulations mentioned above, as well as other healthcare related laws and regulations, Shire has established a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program. The program is intended to prevent, detect and mitigate risk across the organization and throughout the lifecycle of Shire’s products. Shire’s program is founded on a culture and expectation of compliance at all levels of the organization. It also includes, among other things, resources to address compliance globally; formal compliance governance; mechanisms to intake and address questions and concerns; policies, processes and procedures; communications; training; various forms of risk-based auditing and monitoring; review of alleged misconduct; and, when necessary, disciplinary action for failure to comply. All of these actions are intended to protect Shire from conduct by individual employees and agents that may be in violation of legal and regulatory requirements and the Company’s compliance expectations.
Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Shire’s business. Shire expects that compliance with laws and regulations around the globe increasingly will require significant technical expertise and capital investment. Healthcare regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining approval to market and promote products, and Shire’s potential failure to meet its compliance obligations may result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of products, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for product production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. The Company expects to continuously devote substantial resources to proactively maintain, administer and expand its ethics and compliance program globally.
38

Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing
The Company’s revenue depends, in part, upon the price that third parties, such as health care providers and governmental organizations, reimburse on behalf of patients and physicians for the cost of the Company’s products or competitive products and treatments. These third party payers increasingly are challenging the pricing of drugs and medical devices through tougher contracting and seeking increased pharmaco-economic data in order to justify the pricing of products.

In the U.S.:
Commercial Managed Care
Commercial payers negotiate the pricing of products to control their costs, including the use of formularies to encourage members to utilize preferred products with favorable terms. Exclusion from a formulary, or a disfavored formulary position, can directly reduce product usage in the payer’s patient population and may negatively impact utilization in other payer plans as well. The consolidation of Pharmacy Benefits Managers (“PBMs”) may result in increased pricing pressure from the larger purchasing power of such consolidated entities. Whether manufacturers can continue to issue coupons for managed care members, without being removed from the plan’s formulary, will also affect utilization of a manufacturer’s drugs. Although the Secretary of HHS has approved the use of coupons for health exchange (“HIX”) plans, several groups are fighting the implementation of the guidance. Overall drug usage could increase due to the expansion of covered lives under the ACA albeit with greater rebate liability.
Medicaid
Many of the Company’s products are reimbursed by Medicaid, which is a joint federal and state health insurance plan for low-income individuals and people with disabilities in the U.S. Medicaid mandates federal rebates from manufacturers for participation in the program. Many states outsource management of Medicaid benefits to third parties (“Managed Medicaid” or “MMC”), leaving it to them to negotiate commercial rebates and formulary position with manufacturers. Due to changes within the ACA, utilization adjudicated by commercial Managed Medicaid payers is also eligible for the mandated federal rebates, which were traditionally paid only on fee-for-service utilization. Other states manage their own formulary and require manufacturers to pay additional “state supplemental” rebates for positioning on its preferred drug list ("PDL"). In addition, several states have started actively managing hemophilia and other specialty drug costs, either through first-time PDLs or through adjustments in their reimbursement rates to providers.
Medicare
As specified by the 21st Century Cures Act, passed into law in December 2016, Medicare reimbursement for durable medical equipment ("DME") infused drugs and biologics (e.g., subcutaneous administration delivered via a pump) changed from average wholesale price ("AWP") minus 5% to average sales price ("ASP") plus 6% (AWP - 5% to ASP +6%) effective January 1, 2017. In addition, beginning January 1, 2017, DME infused drugs may not be included in the DME competitive acquisition program (DME competitive bidding). 
Medicare reimbursement rates for physician infused drugs, including some of Shire’s orphan drugs, have been reduced from 106% of ASP to approximately 104% of ASP as a result of the so-called "sequestration" passed into law several years ago. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) is also increasingly bundling drug reimbursement into procedure costs, which can severely decrease the reimbursement rates to physicians for some manufacturers’ drugs, biologicals and medical devices. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”), Medicare reimbursement payments to eligible professionals who are not meaningful users of Certified Electronic Health Record (“EHR”) Technology will be reduced. CMS had proposed further reductions in ASP-based reimbursement as part of its Medicare Part B drug demonstration project, but has since withdrawn the proposal.
39

ACA
The rate of implementation of the Medicaid expansion, HIX and Accountable Care Organizations (“ACO”) varies tremendously on a state-by-state basis. It is not possible to predict the overall increases in Medicaid, MMC and HIX business, and the financial implications to Shire specifically. Depending on HHS’ ability to rectify the HIX’s technology issues, and HHS’ flexibility with states asking for alternative approaches to Medicaid expansion, the ACA expansion in covered lives could be severely reduced. At this time, it is not possible to predict the impact of the new U.S. administration’s proposed repeal of the ACA or propensity to apply changes in funding for key provisions or to determine what might replace the current legislation.
“Dual-eligibles”
Individuals that qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid are deemed "dual-eligible." Although CMS has placed dual-eligibles under the coverage of Medicare Part D for retail pharmaceutical coverage, there are several initiatives aimed at moving these individuals back under Medicaid, where their drug utilization would again be subjected to full Medicaid rebates.
On February 1, 2016, CMS issued regulations implementing the Medicaid rebate provisions of the ACA (the “Final Rule”). CMS’ interpretation of the rebates related to line extensions, and the Average Manufacturer Price (“AMP”) aspects of the Final Rule, could increase rebate costs. CMS’ proposed expansion of the Medicaid rebate program to U.S. Territories (including Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and Samoa) could also impact both the Company’s contracting strategies to some of these Territories and increase Shire’s Medicaid rebate and operational costs. CMS’ publication of its own pricing compendium, (“NADAC”), as well as AMP-based Federal Upper Limits (“FUL”) could affect reimbursement to pharmacists for drugs and the state’s ability to continue providing access to brands that have generic versions, depending on the rate of each state’s adoption. 
The tax revenue aspects of the fiscal cliff in the Budget Control Act were not fully resolved via the Taxpayers Relief Act of 2012, and because of this and due to the budget climate in the U.S., government programs like Medicare, Medicaid and others could face additional spending cuts or changes which could affect government payer utilization or payment of Shire’s products.
Outside of the U.S. 
In the EU and certain other territories, price controls and Health Technology Assessments for new, highly priced medicines are expected. Uncertainty exists about the pricing and reimbursement status of newly approved products in the EU. Germany, for example, has implemented the Act for the Restructuring of the Pharmaceutical Market in Statutory Health Insurance. This law essentially maintains free pricing for new chemical entities for one year, but assesses the patient relative benefit of new drugs within six months of commercialization, in order to inform subsequent price negotiations. Prices of drugs bringing added patient benefit will qualify for price negotiation, while those with no added benefit will be subject to reference pricing, where price is determined by taking the lowest and/or average price of similar medicines in Germany. Criteria required to prove a drug’s benefit in Germany include an improvement of health, reduction of illness duration, extension of survival, reduction of side effects or improvement of the quality of life. Third party reimbursement limits may reduce the demand for the Company’s products. The slow pace of the price applications process in some countries has delayed and, occasionally, prevented product launches. In some countries regional authorities are seeking to constrain drug prices and uptake. As such the Company’s estimated product launches may be delayed. Furthermore, ADHD and behavioral drugs in the EU and other markets require strong education and promotion efforts in order to gain acceptance and an economically viable reimbursement profile.

Agreements with Baxter
Prior to their separation in July 2015, Baxalta and Baxter entered into several agreements to effect the separation and provide a framework for Baxalta’s relationship with Baxter after the separation. These agreements, some of which are summarized below, govern the relationship between Baxter and Baxalta subsequent to the separation and provide for the separation of the assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after the separation.
40

Separation and Distribution Agreement
Baxter and Baxalta entered into a separation and distribution agreement which sets forth the agreements between Baxter and Baxalta regarding the principal transactions required to effect Baxalta’s separation from Baxter and other agreements governing Baxalta’s relationship with Baxter. It also identified assets transferred, liabilities assumed and contracts assigned to each of Baxalta and Baxter as part of the separation, and provided for when and how these transfers, assumptions and assignments were to occur.
Transition Services Agreement
Baxter and Baxalta entered into a transition services agreement prior to the separation pursuant to which Baxalta and Baxter and their respective subsidiaries provide to each other, on an interim, transitional basis, various services, including services to be provided by Baxter such as, among others, finance, information technology, human resources, quality, supply chain and certain other administrative services.
Long Term Services Agreement
Baxter and Baxalta entered into a long term services agreement prior to the separation pursuant to which Baxter and Baxalta and their respective subsidiaries provide to each other certain services at shared facilities following the separation, such as providing utilities and other critical services, the absence of which could disrupt the parties’ operations.
Tax Matters Agreement
Baxter and Baxalta entered into a tax matters agreement prior to the distribution which generally governs their respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes for any tax period ending on or before the separation date, as well as tax periods beginning before and ending after the separation. In addition, the tax matters agreement addresses the allocation of liability for taxes that were incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken to effectuate the distribution and provides for Baxalta to indemnify Baxter against any tax liabilities resulting from Baxalta’s action or inaction that causes the merger-related transactions to be taxable. For a description of the potential effect of the combination on the tax status of the separation and related transactions, see section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Combination with Baxalta Incorporated.” 
Manufacturing and Supply Agreement
Baxalta entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxter prior to the separation pursuant to which Baxalta or Baxter, as the case may be, manufacture, label, and package products for the other party. Baxalta’s rights to such technology are limited by the terms of the Galaxy license agreement described herein, including with respect to the use of such technology and the physical location and ownership of any such equipment.
Galaxy License Agreement
Baxalta entered into an intellectual property license agreement with Baxter, which we refer to as the Galaxy license agreement, pursuant to which Baxalta received a perpetual, non-transferrable, non-sublicenseable, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide license to certain intellectual property known as the Galaxy technology in order to allow Baxalta to continue using such technology in its plasma-derived products. This license primarily provides Baxalta with the right to Galaxy trademarks, as well as know-how and trade secrets necessary to operate and maintain (but not to manufacture) equipment using the Galaxy technology.
Transitional Trademark License Agreement
Baxalta and Baxter entered into a transitional trademark license agreement pursuant to which each granted the other a non-exclusive, royalty-free and worldwide license to use certain of each other’s trademarks following the separation, with the license granted to Baxter limited to use by Baxter in its performance of its obligations under the separation transaction agreements. The license to Baxalta allows it to continue using certain of Baxter’s trademarks (including the Baxter name) in order to provide sufficient time for Baxalta to rebrand or phase out its use of the licensed marks.
41

Employee Matters Agreement
Baxalta entered into an employee matters agreement with Baxter which allocated assets, liabilities and responsibilities relating to employee compensation and benefit plans and programs and other related matters in connection with the separation, including the treatment of outstanding incentive awards and certain retirement and welfare benefit obligations, both in and outside of the United States.
International Commercial Operations Agreement
Baxalta and Baxter entered into an international commercial operations agreement that provided for the conduct of the Baxalta business by Baxter in such countries until the local separation is completed, and provided that Baxalta will be subject to all the risks and burdens of, and will be entitled to all the rewards generated by, the Baxalta business during such period, since the local separation of Baxalta’s business in certain countries outside the United States did not occur prior to the separation due to regulatory requirements, the need to obtain consents from local governmental authorities, and other business reasons.
Letter Agreement with Baxter and Shire
On January 11, 2016, Baxter, Shire and Baxalta entered into a letter agreement (“Letter Agreement”) in connection with the acquisition, which, among other things, addresses certain aspects of the tax matters agreement and modified certain aspects of the shareholder’s and registration rights agreement.
Under the Letter Agreement, from and after the closing of the acquisition, Baxalta agreed to indemnify, and Shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to, Baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees against certain tax-related losses resulting from the acquisition (other than losses resulting from any disposition of Baxalta common stock by Baxter (i) that are not attributable to the acquisition and (ii) other than in the initial distribution on July 1, 2015 and certain debt-for-equity exchanges, exchange offers, contribution of Baxalta shares to Baxter’s U.S. pension fund or a dividend distribution to Baxter’s stockholders (in each case as contemplated by the Letter Agreement)).
In addition, under the Letter Agreement, Shire agreed to cooperate with Baxalta and Baxter to enable Baxalta to comply with its obligations under the shareholder’s and registration rights agreement and to use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate Baxter’s disposition of Baxalta common stock in certain SEC-registered offerings. Each of Shire and Baxalta agreed in the Letter Agreement not to hold their respective stockholder meetings to approve, and not to consummate, the acquisition before the earliest of (a) the date that Baxter completed marketing periods for two debt-for-equity exchanges and one equity exchange offer with respect to its Baxalta common stock, (b) the date on which Baxter disposed of all its Baxalta common stock, or (c) June 17, 2016 (subject to tolling or extension (generally to no later than June 25, 2016) under certain circumstances). Prior to Shire’s acquisition of Baxalta, Baxter had disposed of all remaining shares of Baxalta’s common stock retained in connection with the separation.
Responsibility

Corporate responsibility (“Responsibility”) matters to Shire's business. It is how the Company improves the lives of patients, employees, and local and global communities, as well as how the Company conducts every aspect of its business with integrity and ethics. It is a core value that has long been embedded across the Company and ensures accountability for social, economic, and environmental impacts. This commitment to Responsibility is supported by Shire’s Board of Directors, championed by the Chief Executive Officer, and driven forward by Shire’s senior leaders. 

In the fall of 2016, Shire conducted a materiality assessment with external stakeholders (including patient groups, investors, suppliers and non-government organizations) and Shire senior leaders and employees to identify and prioritize Responsibility issues of greatest significance to Shire and its key stakeholders. Participants consistently expressed the high importance of patient-related issues, including: access to medicine; product quality and safety; innovation; ethical business conduct; and, transparency. Additionally, the ability to attract and develop talent ranked high in importance. The outcomes of this assessment, combined with additional benchmarking research, are informing Shire’s Responsibility strategy development, planning, and goal setting for 2017 and beyond. 
Following the acquisition of Baxalta, the Company also formed a new Responsibility sponsor network. Through this global network, Shire senior leaders  play a fundamental role in reviewing and directing Shire’s Responsibility strategies, activities, and policies to ensure the Company is aligned and maintains high standards. Members of the network also

serve as champions for Responsibility throughout the organization and with external stakeholders. They meet as a group at least twice a year to monitor progress and more frequently in working groups. Shire’s Responsibility team facilitates the working groups, partners with sponsors, and drives communications and reporting. 
Shire communicates internally on a frequent basis about Responsibility, knowing that it matters to the employees, and externally through a section on its website, via social media, and through its Annual Responsibility Review.
