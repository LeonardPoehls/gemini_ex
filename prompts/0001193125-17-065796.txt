 On January 4, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Pace (the Combination). As part of the transaction, both ARRIS Group and Pace became wholly-owned subsidiaries of ARRIS International plc, our new holding company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. While our jurisdiction of organization was changed, our corporate headquarters remain in the United States. 
 Except for historical financial information, which relates only to ARRIS Group, or as context otherwise requires, our description of the Company and the industry and markets we operate in described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflects the combined operations of ARRIS and Pace. We continue to operate in two business segments  Network & Cloud and Consumer Premises Equipment  and the former Pace operations are included in these segments. 
 On February 22, 2017, ARRIS, Broadcom Corporation, and a subsidiary of Broadcom entered into a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (Purchase Agreement), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in the Purchase Agreement, ARRIS will acquire Brocade Communication System Inc.s Ruckus Wireless and ICX Switch business (the Brocade Network Edge Business) for approximately $800 million in cash, subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The acquisition is subject to the completion of the acquisition of Brocade by Broadcom. 
 Industry Overview 
 Entertainment and communications delivery is evolving rapidly as a result of a convergence of trends  including increased competition among service providers, industry consolidation, advances in technology, and shifts in global content consumption behaviors. 
 Video distribution over the broadband IP network is transforming how content is managed and consumed. IP not only facilitates new forms of video  like Over-the-Top TV (OTT) and interactive television  and the ways in which video is delivered, but also accelerates the evolution of communications services, like interactive media and broadband. As a result, service providers are compelled to continually invest in and upgrade their network and expand their video, voice, data, and mobile services. This trend has accelerated as service providers have raced to deliver residential gigabit broadband speeds to fully support new multiscreen video services and the explosion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 
 Providing these advanced services to consumers is a highly competitive business. This environment is driving service providers to enhance and expand their offerings by adding more high-definition (HD) channels, and now Ultra High Definition (UHD) TV content, increasing data speeds and expanding wireless services to provide converged media experiences that bridge conventional TV and Internet services. This competition is the catalyst for ongoing video and broadband network upgrades as well as technology investment cycles in CPE, such as set-tops, gateways and modems. 
 Service providers continue to invest in new capabilities to differentiate and gain market share. These investments have resulted in enhanced user interfaces, higher broadband speeds, additional programming, integrated home networking and monitoring services with higher reliability. These cycles, combined with associated consumer trends and innovation in entertainment and communications delivery continue to drive industry growth. 
 Operating Segments 
 We operate in two business segments, (1) Network & Cloud and (2) Customer Premises Equipment. Corporate and other expenses not included in the measure of segment contribution are reported in an All Other category. See Note 10 Segment Information of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales, sales engineering and technical services teams serve our global customers through offices in the U.S. and many of our global markets. We also work with value added resellers (VARs), sales representatives and channel partners that extend our sales presence into operator markets where we do not have established sales offices. We also maintain an inside sales group that is responsible for regular phone contact with the customer to ensure prompt order entry, accurate delivery, and effective sales administration. 
 Our sales engineering team assists customers in system design and specification. Our technical services team provides professional services to help network operators design and keep their networks operating at peak performance. We provide 24x7 technical support, directly and through channel partners, as well as training, both at our facilities and at our customers sites. 
 We achieve superior customer service through advanced customer relationship management programs combined with information systems that allow us to provide personalized and timely customer support on a range of subjects and to continually refine operations management. 
 Our marketing organization promotes both the ARRIS brand and our solutions to key stakeholders including customers, consumers, partners, prospects and employees throughout the world. It is complemented by a product management team, which works with our engineering teams to develop and market new products and product enhancements. These teams are responsible for overall business profitability, commercial teams, inventory management, delivery requirements, and market demand analysis, as well as product positioning, communications and advertising. 
 Customers 
 The majority of our sales are to facilities-based cable, telco and satellite multi-channel video service providers. As the global telecommunications industry continues a trend toward consolidation, our sales to the largest service providers are crucial to our success. Our sales are substantially dependent upon a system operators selection of ARRISs network equipment, demand for increased broadband services by subscribers, and general capital expenditure levels by system operators. Our three largest customers (including their affiliates, as applicable) are AT&T, Charter and Comcast. From time to time, the affiliates included in our revenues from these customers have changed as a result of mergers and acquisitions. Therefore, the revenue for our customers for prior periods has been adjusted to include, on a comparable basis for all periods presented, the affiliates currently understood to be under common control. Our sales to these customers for the last three years were (in thousands, except percentages): 

 | Years ended December 31, | 
 | 2016 | | | 2015 | | | 2014
AT&T and affiliates | $ | 901,001 | | | $ | 347,063 | | $ | 612,412 | 
% of sales | | 13.2 | % | | | 7.2 | % | | 11.5 | %
Charter and affiliates | $ | 1,064,408 | (1) | | $ | 960,497 | | $ | 1,031,553 | 
% of sales | | 15.6 | % | | | 20.0 | % | | 19.4 | %
Comcast and affiliates | $ | 1,637,519 | (1) | | $ | 1,007,376 | | $ | 1,012,367 | 
% of sales | | 24.0 | % | | | 21.0 | % | | 19.0 | %

 
8 
 

(1) | Revenues were reduced by $30.2 million in total as a result of Warrants held by Charter and Comcast that are intended to incent additional purchases from them. (see Note 17 Warrants of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).

 ARRIS generally utilizes standard terms of sale. These standard terms of sale apply to all customer purchases, except those to a few of our large customers with whom we have executed general purchase agreements (GPAs). These GPAs do not generally obligate the customer to a specific volume of business. The vast majority of our sales, whether to customers with GPAs or otherwise, result from periodic purchase orders. We have multiple agreements with our largest customers, including AT&T, Charter and Comcast, based upon their needs or as a result of prior acquisitions. We maintain these agreements in the normal course of our business. 
 International Operations 
 Our international revenue is generated primarily from Asia-Pacific, EMEA and Americas. The Asia-Pacific market includes Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Taiwan. The EMEA market includes Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and United Arab Emirates. The Americas market includes Argentina, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada,, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Peru and Puerto Rico. Revenues from international customers were approximately 28.1%, 28.7%, and 25.7% of total revenues for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 We continue to strategically invest in worldwide marketing and sales efforts. We currently maintain international sales offices in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, South Africa, Spain and United Arab Emirates. 
Research and Development 
 We operate in an industry that is subject to rapid changes in technology, and our success is largely contingent upon anticipating such changes. Accordingly, we invest significantly in research and development. This commitment to innovation resulted in the development of many next-generation solutions such as CCAP, Fiber Deep, DOCSIS3.1, HD-DVR, WholeHome DVR/media server, in-home and metro Wi-Fi, IoT and 4K/UHD.

Research and development expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $584.9 million, $534.2 million and $556.6 million, respectively. Research and development expenses as a percent of sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately 8.6%, 11.1% and 10.5%, respectively. These costs include an allocation of common costs associated with information technology and facilities. 
Intellectual Property 
 We have an active patenting program for protecting our innovations. During 2016, we continued to enhance our patent portfolio. We were awarded 204 patents and filed 455 patent applications. As of January 31, 2017, our intellectual property portfolio consisted of approximately 2,560 issued patents (both U.S. and foreign), including patents acquired in connection with the Pace acquisition, and we continue to pursue patent protection on new inventions (currently approximately 1,240 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending). 
 In our effort to pursue new patents, we have created a process whereby employees may submit ideas of inventions for review by patent committees. The review process evaluates each submission based on criteria that includes: novelty, potential commercial value of the invention, and detectability of infringement. Patent applications are filed on these inventions that meet the criteria. 
 Although patents generally have a 20 year legal life, the relevant technologies to which the patents apply often have much shorter lives. As such, the economic useful life of the patents is often the same as that of the associated developed technology. 
 Our patents and patent applications generally are in the areas of telecommunications hardware, software and related technologies. For technology that is not owned by us, we have a program for obtaining appropriate licenses to ensure that we have the necessary license coverage for our products. In addition, we have formed strategic relationships with leading technology companies to provide us with early access to technology that we believe will help keep us at the forefront of our industry. 
 We also have a program for protecting and developing trademarks. As of January 31, 2017, ARRIS had 588 registered or pending trademark registrations. Our trademark program includes procedures for the use of current trademarks and for the development of new trademarks. This program is designed to ensure that our employees properly use our registered trademarks and any new trademarks that are expected to develop strong brand loyalty and name recognition. The design of our trademark program is intended to protect our trademarks from dilution or cancellation. 
 From time to time there are significant disputes with respect to the ownership of the technology used in our industry and accusations of patent infringements. See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings. 
 Product Sourcing and Distribution 
 We maintain a balance of internal and external manufacturing providers to continue offering our customers a competitive combination of quality, cost and flexibility in meeting their needs. We operate manufacturing facilities in Taipei, Taiwan; Tijuana, Mexico; and Manaus, Brazil. We also use contract manufacturers located in Brazil, China, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand and the United States. 
 We provide our contract manufacturers with rolling, non-binding forecasts, and we typically have a minimum of 60 days of purchase orders placed with them for products. Purchase orders for delivery within 60 days generally are not cancelable. Purchase orders with delivery past 60 days generally may be cancelled with penalties in accordance with each vendors terms. Each contract manufacturer provides a minimum 15-month warranty. 
 We manufacture a significant portion of our video set-tops and gateways in our manufacturing facility in Hsin Tien, Taiwan. The factory is 209,600 square feet, and, as of December 31, 2016, the facility employed approximately 1,000 people. We manufacture a limited amount of video set-tops in Manaus, Brazil to serve the local market. The factory is 59,202 square feet, and, as of December 31, 2016, the facility employed approximately 150 people. Current outsourcing arrangements include the manufacture of set-tops, modems, DTAs and IP set-tops.

Current outsourcing arrangements include CMTS, amplifiers, certain power supplies, accessories, optical modules, digital return modules, circuit boards, repair services, and video infrastructure equipment. 
 We distribute a substantial number of products that are not produced by us in order to provide our customers with a comprehensive portfolio offering. Domestically, we distribute hardware and installation products through regional warehouses in California, North Carolina, and Washington. Internationally, we distribute through regional warehouses in Australia, Germany and Japan, and through drop shipments from our contract manufacturers located throughout the world. 
 We obtain key components from numerous third-party suppliers. Our supply agreements include technology licensing and component purchase contracts. Several of our competitors have similar supply agreements for these components. In addition, we license software for operating network and security systems or sub-systems and a variety of routing protocols from different suppliers. 
 Backlog 
 Our backlog consists of unfilled customer orders (believed to be firm and long-term contracts) that have not been completed. With respect to long-term contracts, we include in our backlog only amounts representing orders currently released for production or, in specific instances, the amount we expect to be released in the succeeding 12 months. The amount contained in backlog for any contract or order may not be the total amount of the contract or order. The amount of our backlog at any given time does not reflect expected revenues for any fiscal period. 
 Our backlog at December 31, 2016 was approximately $1,106.3 million, at December 31, 2015 was approximately $715.8 million, and at December 31, 2014 was approximately $631.0 million. We believe that all of the backlog existing at December 31, 2016 will be shipped in 2017. 
 Anticipated orders from customers may fail to materialize and delivery schedules may be deferred or cancelled for a number of reasons, including reductions in capital spending by network operators, shipping disruptions, customer financial difficulties, annual capital spending budget cycles, and construction delays. 
 Competition

 We distinguish our products on the basis of reliability and performance, differentiated features, flexibility, breadth, customer service, and availability of business solutions, while pricing our solutions competitively with those of other competitors. 
 Consumer demand for more bandwidth is a fundamental driver behind the continued growth in CMTS and CCAP Edge Routing capacity deployed by service providers worldwide. The CMTS/CCAP supplier space is highly competitive with strong historical players such as Cisco and newer products from manufacturers such as Casa, Nokia and Harmonic. 
 ARRIS is a worldwide leader in CMTS and CCAP. Our portfolio of IP network solutions continues to provide the scale and efficiency to power service providers transition to next-generation networks and services.

 Showcase solutions like our E6000® Converged Edge Router are behind this global momentum and are responsible for providing service to millions of subscribers through the worlds leading service providers.
 These network solutions are complemented by ARRISs worldwide leadership in CPE  including video set-tops/gateways, DOCSIS, DSL, and FTTH solutions. This positions ARRIS to capitalize on several key industry opportunities: 1) the set-tops evolution into the gateway for all communications, media, and other connected services; 2) the shift to gigabit Wi-Fi and its growing role as a principal conduit for the connected home; 3) the refresh cycle of todays broadly deployed base of set-tops and broadband gateways; and 4) the evolution and hybridization of network standards and models, from xDSL to G.Fast, D3.1 to xPON, new IP video services, and more.
 Our multi-screen content management and protection products compete with many vendors offering on-demand video and digital advertising insertion hardware and software, including Adobe, Cisco, Concurrent, Ericsson, Irdeto, SeaChange, TiVo, Verimatrix, and others. Our operations management systems compete with vendors offering network management, mobile workforce management, network configuration management, and network capacity management systems such as Oracle (formerly TOA Technologies), Click Software, Guavus and others, some of which may currently have greater sales in these areas than ARRIS. In some instances, our customers internally develop their own software for these functions. However, we believe that we offer a more integrated solution that gives us a competitive advantage in supporting the requirements of both todays distribution networks and the emerging all-digital, packet-based networks. 
 We also compete with companies such as Cisco, Harmonic, Huawei, Teleste, Technetix and ZTE for network distribution and access equipment. In recent periods, competition in this market has increased from aftermarket suppliers, whose primary focus is on the refurbishment of OEM equipment, resulting in additional competition for new sales opportunities. In addition, because of the convergence of the cable and telecommunications sectors and rapid technological development, new competitors may enter this space. 
 Lastly, some of our competitors are larger companies with greater financial resources and product breadth than us. This may enable them to bundle products or be able to market and price products more aggressively than we can. 
 Regulation and Corporate Responsibility 
 Our products and operations are subject to numerous U.S. and international regulations and requirements in the areas of labor, environmental compliance, including energy efficiency standards, health and safety and ethics. We are committed to strong corporate responsibility, and in 2016, we continued our participation as an active member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), a non-profit coalition of electronics companies dedicated to supporting the rights and wellbeing of workers and communities affected by the global electronics supply chain. We continue to work with our suppliers by utilizing the EICC process collaboratively to improve working and environmental conditions through industry leading standards and practices to drive continual improvement and mitigate risk. Additional information regarding these policies and programs is available under the Investors tab of our corporate website (www.arris.com). 
 As signatories to the Voluntary Agreement for Ongoing Improvement to the Energy Efficiency of Set-Top Boxes and Small Network Equipment in the U.S., the SCTE/ISBEs Energy 20/20 initiative and the Voluntary Industry Agreement to Improve the Energy Consumption of Complex Set-Top Boxes in the European Union, we continue to be committed to reducing our environmental impact through increasing the energy efficiency of our products while still protecting our need to adapt to rapidly changing technology and the introduction of new features. 
 Modern Slavery 
 We are dedicated to ensuring that human rights are respected at all times. We have implemented a number of business policies to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, our contractors and our suppliers employees. We require that our suppliers conduct themselves in a lawful and ethical manner and maintain high standards. Aligning with the requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act, our Supplier Code of Conduct requires 
 
13 
 
 that our suppliers not use forced, bonded or involuntary prison labor or child labor when producing products. To enforce the Supplier Code of Conduct, we audit our product supply chain to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Under our supply contracts, we have the right to audit all suppliers for compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. We also mandate annual employee training that covers human trafficking. This annual training emphasizes our requirement that our suppliers also must comply with the ARRIS Supplier Code of Conduct.
 Employees 
 As of January 31, 2017, we had approximately 7,020 employees. ARRIS has no employees represented by unions within the United States. We believe that we have a strong relationship with our employees. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of certain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. We have entered into employment contracts with our key executive officers and have confidentiality agreements with substantially all of our employees. We also have long-term incentive programs that are intended to provide substantial incentives for our key employees to remain with us.
