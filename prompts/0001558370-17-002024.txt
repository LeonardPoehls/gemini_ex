 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc.
 Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc. (the “Company”, “We”, or “Our”), is a Pennsylvania business corporation and a bank holding company registered under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”). We are supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”).  Our legal headquarters are located at One Bala Plaza, Suite 522, 231 St. Asaph’s Road, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, 19004.  
 The principal activities of the Company are supervising Royal Bank America (“Royal Bank”) which engages in general banking business principally in Montgomery, Delaware, Chester, Bucks, Philadelphia and Berks counties in Pennsylvania, central and southern New Jersey, and Delaware.  Royal Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the “Department”).  We also have a wholly-owned non-bank subsidiary, Royal Investments of Delaware, Inc., which is engaged in investment activities.  
 At December 31, 2016, we had consolidated total assets of approximately $832.5 million, total deposits of approximately $629.5 million and shareholders’ equity of approximately $51.6 million. The Company’s two Delaware trusts, Royal Bancshares Capital Trust I and Royal Bancshares Capital Trust II, are not consolidated per requirements under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, “Consolidation” (“ASC Topic 810”).  We have two reportable operating segments, “Community Banking” and “Tax Liens”.
 On  January 30, 2017, the Company and Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation (“Bryn Mawr”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”).  The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Company will merge with and into Bryn Mawr, with Bryn Mawr as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”).  Immediately following the Merger, Royal Bank will merge with the Bryn Mawr Trust Company, the wholly owned subsidiary of Bryn Mawr.  Upon completion of the Merger, holders of Class A common stock of the Company will receive 0.1025 shares of Bryn Mawr common stock, par value of $1.00 per share (the “Bryn Mawr common stock”) for each share of Class A common stock they hold, and holders of Class B common stock of the Company will receive 0.1179 shares of Bryn Mawr common stock for each share of Class B common stock they hold.  The Merger, which is subject to a number of closing conditions including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by the Company’s shareholders, is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017.

 Regulatory Actions 
 Federal Reserve Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”)
 As previously disclosed, in March 2010, the Company agreed to enter into a written agreement (the “Federal Reserve Agreement”) with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (the “Federal Reserve Bank”).  Effective July 17, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System terminated the enforcement action under the Federal Reserve Agreement, and it was replaced with an informal non-public agreement, a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”), with the Federal Reserve Bank.  The MOU was terminated in writing by the Federal Reserve Bank in February 2017. Royal Bank America
 Royal Bank was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on July 30, 1963, was chartered by the Department, and commenced operation as a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank on October 22, 1963.  Royal Bank is the successor of the Bank of King of Prussia, the principal ownership of which was acquired by the Tabas family in 1980.  The deposits of Royal Bank are insured by the FDIC.  Royal Bank’s subsidiaries include Royal Real Estate of Pennsylvania, Inc., Royal Investments America, LLC, RBA Property LLC, Narberth Property Acquisition LLC, Rio Marina LLC, and Royal Tax Lien Services, LLC (“RTL”). Royal Bank also has an 80% and 60% ownership interest in Crusader Servicing Corporation (“CSC”) and Royal Bank America Leasing, LP, respectively. 
 Royal Bank derives its income principally from interest charged on loans and leases, interest earned on investment securities, and fees received in connection with the origination of loans and other services.  Royal Bank’s principal expenses are interest expense on deposits and borrowings and operating expenses.  Operating revenues, deposit growth, investment principal amortization payments, maturities and sales, loan and other real estate owned (“OREO”) sales and the repayment of outstanding loans provide the majority of funds for activities.
 Royal Bank conducts business operations as a commercial bank offering traditional consumer and business deposit products and services (excluding trust) and commercial and consumer loans, including home equity and small business loans.  Fee income services such as a suite of cash management products, remote deposit capture, mobile deposits, and payroll and merchant services have been greatly improved or expanded.  Services may be added or deleted from time to time.  Royal Bank’s business and services are not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations.
 Service Area: Royal Bank’s primary service area includes Pennsylvania, primarily Montgomery, Chester, Bucks, Delaware, Berks and Philadelphia counties, and central and southern  New Jersey.  This area includes residential areas and industrial and commercial businesses of the type usually found within a major metropolitan area.  Royal Bank serves this area from thirteen retail branches located throughout Montgomery, Philadelphia, Delaware and Berks counties and Camden County, New Jersey.  We lease Royal Bank’s Customer Center, which includes a loan production office, in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania and a loan production office in Princeton, New Jersey.  In February 2017, Royal Bank closed one branch location and intends to sell the building during the first quarter of 2017. Royal Bank also considers New York, Maryland, and Delaware as a part of its service area for certain products and services.  In the past, Royal Bank had frequently conducted business with clients located outside of its service area.  Royal Bank has loans in 16 states and Washington, D.C. via loan originations with service area borrowers and/or participations with other lenders who have broad experience in those respective markets. Royal Bank’s headquarters are located at 732 Montgomery Avenue, Narberth, Pennsylvania 19072.
 Competition: The financial services industry in our service area is extremely competitive.  Competitors within our service area include banks and bank holding companies with greater resources.  Many competitors have substantially higher legal lending limits.  In addition, savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, money market and other mutual funds, brokerage firms, mortgage companies, leasing companies, finance companies and other financial services companies offer products and services similar to those offered by Royal Bank, on competitive terms.
 Many bank holding companies have elected to become financial holding companies under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, and such companies may provide a broader range of products and services with which Royal Bank must compete.  Management believes this statute further narrowed the differences and intensified competition among commercial banks, investment banks, insurance firms and other financial services companies.  We have not elected financial holding company status.
 Employees: Royal Bank employed approximately 117 persons on a full-time equivalent basis as of December 31, 2016.

 Deposits: At December 31, 2016, total deposits of Royal Bank were distributed among demand deposits (16%), money market deposit, savings and NOW accounts (47%) and time deposits (37%).  At year-end 2016, deposits increased $43.0 million to $631.9 million from year-end 2015, or 7.3%, and reflected a change in the composition. Savings accounts grew $31.3 million, or 58.2% from December 31, 2015.  Additionally, certificates of deposits and demand deposits increased $25.7 million and $5.7 million, respectively.  NOW and money market accounts decreased $19.7 million. Included in Royal Bank’s deposits are approximately $2.3 million of intercompany deposits that are eliminated through consolidation.
 Lending: At December 31, 2016, Royal Bank had a total net loan portfolio of $591.6 million, representing 71.4% of total assets.  The loan portfolio is categorized into commercial demand, commercial mortgages, residential mortgages (including home equity lines of credit), construction, tax lien certificates, small business leases and installment loans.  At year-end 2016, net loans grew $102.2 million from year end 2015.  
 Non-Bank Subsidiaries
 On June 30, 1995, we established a special purpose Delaware investment company, Royal Investment of Delaware (“RID”), as a wholly-owned subsidiary. RID’s legal headquarters is 1105 N. Market Street, Suite 1300, Wilmington, Delaware 19899.  RID buys, holds and sells investment securities. At December 31, 2016, total assets of RID were $5.5 million, of which $4.8 million was held in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 million was held in investment securities.  RID had net interest income of $587 thousand and $666 thousand for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Non-interest income for 2016 and 2015 was $516 thousand and $316 thousand, respectively, and was comprised of net gains on sale of investment securities.  RID recorded net income of $1.0 million for 2016 compared to $781 thousand for 2015.  Royal Bank has previously extended loans to RID, secured by securities, as per the provisions of Regulation W.  At December 31, 2016, no loans were outstanding.  The amounts above include the activity related to RID’s wholly-owned subsidiary Royal Preferred LLC.
 The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Royal Bank, has an 80% ownership interest in CSC.  CSC acquired, through auction, delinquent property tax certificates in various jurisdictions, assuming a lien position that is generally superior to any mortgage liens on the property, and obtaining certain foreclosure rights as defined by state law.  Royal Bank and a majority of  other CSC shareholders, voted to liquidate CSC under an orderly, long term plan adopted by CSC management.  CSC’s legal headquarters is located at 732 Montgomery Avenue, Narberth, Pennsylvania 19072. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, total assets of CSC were $1.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively. Included in total assets was OREO of $225 thousand and $3.2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For 2016, CSC recorded net interest expense of $213 thousand compared to $297 thousand for 2015 due to the continued liquidation of CSC’s tax lien certificate portfolio.  The 2016 credit for lien losses was $49 thousand compared to $2 thousand for 2015.  For 2016 and 2015, non-interest income was $0 thousand and $62 thousand, respectively.  Non-interest expense was a credit of $566 thousand compared to an expense of $125 thousand for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Included in non-interest expense is net gains on the sale of OREO of $645 thousand and $101 thousand for 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2016, CSC sold its largest tax lien property and received net proceeds of $3.8 million.  CSC recorded net income of $402 thousand in 2016 compared to a net loss of $357 thousand in 2015.  
 On June 23, 2003, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Royal Bank, established Royal Investments America, LLC (“RIA”) as a wholly-owned subsidiary.  RIA’s legal headquarters is located at 732 Montgomery Avenue, Narberth, Pennsylvania 19072.  RIA was formed to invest in equity real estate ventures subject to limitations imposed by regulation.  At December 31, 2016 and 2015, total assets of RIA were $6.5 million and $6.1 million, which included $6.3 million and $5.8 million in cash, respectively. For 2016, RIA recorded net income of $483 thousand compared to $170 thousand for 2015.  Net income was directly impacted by gains on the sale of investment securities of $447 thousand and $182 thousand in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 On October 27, 2004, we formed two Delaware trust affiliates, Royal Bancshares Capital Trust I and Royal Bancshares Capital Trust II, in connection with the sale of an aggregate of $25.0 million of trust preferred securities.
 On July 25, 2005, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Royal Bank, formed Royal Bank America Leasing, LP (“Royal Leasing”). Royal Bank holds a 60% ownership interest in Royal Leasing. Royal Leasing’s legal headquarters is located at 550 Township Line Road, Blue Bell, Pennsylvania 19422.  Royal Leasing was formed to originate small business financing leases.  Royal Leasing originates the leases through its internal sales staff and through independent brokers located throughout its business area. In general, Royal Leasing will hold in its portfolio individual leases in amounts of up to $250 thousand. Leases originated in amounts in excess of that are sold to other leasing companies.  At December 31, 2016 and 2015, total assets of Royal Leasing were $61.6 million and $65.1 million, respectively.  For 2016 and 2015, Royal Leasing

had net interest income of $3.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively.  For 2016, the provision for lease losses was $1.4 million compared to $906 thousand for 2015.  The 2016 provision was primarily attributable to specific reserves on the leasing and net charge-off activity.  Total net leases were $61.4 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $65.0 million at December 31, 2015.  Non-interest income for 2016 was $680 thousand compared to $473 thousand for 2015.  Non-interest expense, which includes management distribution fees, was $1.3 million and $1.2 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Royal Leasing recorded net income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.   
 On November 17, 2006, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Royal Bank, formed RTL to purchase and service delinquent tax certificates.  RTL typically acquired delinquent property tax certificates through public auctions in various jurisdictions, assuming a lien position that is generally superior to any mortgage liens that are on the property, and obtaining certain foreclosure rights as defined by state law. RTL ceased acquiring tax certificates at public auctions in 2010.  RTL’s legal headquarters is located at 732 Montgomery Avenue, Narberth, Pennsylvania 19072.  At December 31, 2016, total assets of RTL, of which the majority was held in tax certificates and OREO, were $7.3 million compared to $9.4 million at December 31, 2015.  Tax certificates were $2.6 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $3.3 million at December 31, 2015.  OREO was $3.1 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $4.0 million at December 31, 2015.  For 2016, RTL had net interest expense of $131 thousand compared to net interest income of $116 thousand for 2015 due to the reduction in average tax certificates outstanding over the past year.  Provision for lien losses was $69 thousand compared to $100 thousand for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Non-interest income was $59 thousand for 2016 compared to $209 thousand for 2015. Non-interest expense was $1.1 million for 2016 and 2015. RTL recorded a net loss of $1.1 million for 2016 compared to $885 thousand for 2015.  
 On June 16, 2006, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary RID, established Royal Preferred LLC as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Royal Preferred LLC was formed to purchase a subordinated debenture from Royal Bank. During 2016, the subordinated debenture was redeemed.  At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Royal Preferred LLC had total assets of approximately $0 and $21.2 million, respectively.  
 Website Access to Company Reports
 We post publicly available reports required to be filed with the SEC on our website, www.royalbankamerica.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such reports with the SEC.  The required reports are available free of charge through our website.  Information available on our website is not part of or incorporated by reference into this Report or any other report filed by us with the SEC. Products and Services with Reputation Risk
 We offer a diverse range of financial and banking products and services.  In the event one or more customers and/or governmental agencies become dissatisfied or object to any product or service offered by us or any of our subsidiaries, whether legally justified or not, the resulting negative publicity with respect to any such product or service could have an adverse impact on our reputation. The discontinuance of any product or service, whether or not any customer or governmental agency has challenged any such product or service, could have an unfavorable impact on our reputation. Concentrations, Seasonality
 We do not have any portion of our business dependent on a single or limited number of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.  No substantial portion of loans or investments is concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries, but a significant majority of loans are secured by real estate.  The business of the Company and its subsidiaries is not seasonal in nature.

 Environmental Compliance
 The Company and its subsidiaries’ compliance with federal, state and local environment protection laws had no material effect on their capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in 2016, and is not expected to have a material effect on such expenditures, earnings or competitive position in 2017. Supervision and Regulation
 Bank holding companies and banks operate in a highly regulated environment and are regularly examined by federal and state regulatory authorities.  The following discussion concerns various federal and state laws and regulations and the potential impact of such laws and regulation on us and our subsidiaries.  To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions themselves.  Proposals to change laws and regulations are frequently introduced in Congress, the state legislatures, and before the various bank regulatory agencies.  We cannot determine the likelihood or timing of any such proposals or legislations or the impact they may have on us and our subsidiaries.  A change in law, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business. Holding Company
 We are subject to the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and of state securities commissions for matters relating to the offering and sale of our securities.  Accordingly, if we wish to issue additional shares of our Common Stock, in order, for example, to raise capital or to grant stock options, we will have to comply with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, or find an applicable exemption from registration.
 We are subject to the provisions of the BHCA and to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Board.  The BHCA requires us to secure the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before we own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting shares of any corporation, including another bank.  A bank holding company also is prohibited from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any such company engaged in non-banking activities unless the Federal Reserve Board, by order or regulation, has found such activities to be closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.  In making this determination, the Federal Reserve Board considers whether the performance of these activities by a bank holding company would offer benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects.
 As a bank holding company, we are required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve Board and any additional information that the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHCA. The Federal Reserve Board may also make examinations of the Company and any or all of its subsidiaries.  Further, under the BHCA and the Federal Reserve Board’s regulations, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or provision of credit of any property or services.  The so called “anti-tying” provisions state generally that a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property or furnish any service to a customer on the condition that the customer obtain additional credit or services from the bank, its bank holding company or any other subsidiary of its bank holding company, or on the condition that the customer not obtain other credit or services from a competitor of the bank, its bank holding company or any subsidiary of its bank holding company.  Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act and by state banking laws on any extensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of the holding company’s subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or other securities of the bank holding company and on taking stock or securities of the bank holding company as collateral for loans to any borrower.
 Under the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended, the (“Code”), we are permitted to control an unlimited number of banks.  However, we would be required under the BHCA to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before we could acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or acquire ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank other than Royal Bank, if, after such acquisition, we would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank.  A bank holding company located in Pennsylvania, another state, the District of Columbia or a territory or possession of the United States may control one or more banks, bank and trust companies, national banks, interstate banks and, with the prior written approval of the Department, may acquire control of a bank and trust company or a national bank located in Pennsylvania. A Pennsylvania-chartered institution may maintain a bank, branches in any other state, the District of Columbia, or a territory or possession of the United States upon the written approval of the Department.

 Federal law also prohibits the acquisition of control of a bank holding company without prior notice to certain federal bank regulators.  Control is defined for this purpose as the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of a bank or bank holding company or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company.
 Royal Bank 
 The Department and the FDIC routinely examine Pennsylvania state-chartered, non-member banks such as Royal Bank in areas such as reserves, loans, investments, management practices, and other aspects of operations. These examinations are designed for the protection of depositors rather than the Company’s shareholders.  The deposits of Royal Bank are insured by the FDIC to the maximum amount permitted by law.  
 In addition, Royal Bank is subject to a variety of state and federal laws that affect its operation.  Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern, among other things, the scope of a bank’s business, the investments a bank may make, the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain, the types and terms of loans a bank may make and the collateral it may take, the activities of banks with respect to mergers and consolidations, and the establishment of branches.  
 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIC Act”), the FDIC possesses the power to prohibit institutions regulated by it (such as Royal Bank) from engaging in any activity that would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or in violation of applicable law.  Moreover, the FDIC Act: (i) empowers the FDIC to issue cease-and-desist or civil money penalty orders against Royal Bank or its executive officers, directors and/or principal shareholders based on violations of law or unsafe and unsound banking practices; (ii) authorizes the FDIC to remove executive officers who have participated in such violations or unsound practices; (iii) restricts lending by Royal Bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or related interests thereof; and (iv) restricts management personnel of a bank from serving as directors or in other management positions with certain depository institutions whose assets exceed a specified amount or which have an office within a specified geographic area.  Additionally, the FDIC Act provides that no person may acquire control of Royal Bank unless the FDIC has been given 60-days prior written notice and within that time has not disapproved the acquisition or extended the period for disapproval. 
 Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), the FDIC uses a five-point rating scale to assign a numerical score for a bank’s performance in each of three areas: lending, service and investment.  Under the CRA, the FDIC is required to:  (i) assess the records of all financial institutions regulated by it to determine if these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the community (including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods) which they serve, and (ii) take this record into account in its evaluation of any application made by any such institutions for, among other things, approval of a branch or other deposit facility, office relocation, a merger or an acquisition of another bank.  The CRA also requires the federal banking agencies to make public disclosures of their evaluation of each bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. This evaluation will include a descriptive rating (“outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance”) and a statement describing the basis for the rating.  
 The Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Board regulations also place certain limitations and reporting requirements on extensions of credit by a bank to principal shareholders of its parent holding company, among others, and to related interests of such principal shareholders. In addition, such legislation and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who becomes a principal shareholder of a holding company may obtain credit from banks with which the subsidiary bank maintains a correspondent relationship.
 From time to time, various types of federal and state legislation have been proposed that could result in additional regulation of, and restrictions on, the business of Royal Bank.  It cannot be predicted whether any such legislation will be adopted or how such legislation would affect the business of Royal Bank. As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in the United States, Royal Bank’s business is particularly susceptible to being affected by federal legislation and regulations that may increase the costs of doing business.
 Under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), banks and other financial institutions are required to report to the Internal Revenue Service currency transactions of more than $10 thousand or multiple transactions in any one day of which the banks are aware that exceed $10 thousand in the aggregate.  Civil and criminal penalties are provided under the BSA for failure to file a required report, for failure to supply information required by the BSA or for filing a false or fraudulent report.

 Capital Requirements and Basel III: In order to minimize losses to the deposit insurance funds, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), established a format to monitor FDIC-insured institutions and to enable “prompt corrective action” by the appropriate federal supervisory agency if an institution begins to experience any difficulty. FDICIA established five capital categories for insured depository institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations.  
 An “undercapitalized” institution is one that fails to meet one or more of the required minimum capital levels for an adequately capitalized institution.  An “undercapitalized institution” must file a capital restoration plan and is automatically subject to restrictions on dividends, management fees and asset growth.  In addition, the institution is prohibited from making acquisitions, opening new branches, and engaging in new lines of business without the prior approval of its primary federal regulator and other restrictions may be imposed.
 A “significantly undercapitalized” institution is subject to similar regulatory requirements and restrictions as an “undercapitalized institution.  Additional regulatory directives include mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management and other restrictions.
 A “critically undercapitalized” institution is prohibited from taking the following actions without the prior written approval of its primary federal supervisory agency:  engaging in any material transactions other than in the usual course of business; extending credit for highly leveraged transactions; amending its charter or bylaws; making any material changes in accounting methods; engaging in certain transactions with affiliates; paying excessive compensation or bonuses; and paying interest on liabilities exceeding the prevailing rates in the institution’s market area.  In addition, a “critically undercapitalized” institution is prohibited from paying interest or principal on its subordinated debt and is subject to being placed in conservatorship or receivership if its tangible equity capital level is not increased within certain mandated time frames.
 The overall goal of these capital measures is to impose scrutiny and operational restrictions on banks as they descend the capital categories from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized.  Federal bank regulators may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. 
 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board (“Basel Committee”), which was established by the Group of 20 (“G-20”) Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to take action to strengthen regulation and supervision of the financial system with greater international consistency, cooperation and transparency, have both committed to raise capital standards and liquidity buffers within the banking system. In December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee published the final reforms on capital and liquidity generally referred to as “Basel III”.  
 In July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules with the aim to improve the quality and increase the quantity of capital for all banks as well as set higher standards for large internationally active banks. The agencies view the new capital requirements as a better reflection of banking organizations’ risk profiles, thereby improving the overall resiliency of the banking system. The rules generally implement higher minimum capital requirements, add a new common equity tier 1 capital requirement or “CET1”, and establish criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital.  Basel III also introduces a non-risk adjusted tier 1 leverage ratio of 3%, based on a measure of total exposure rather than total assets, and new liquidity requirements.  Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of CET1 above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets.   The new minimum capital requirements became effective on January 1, 2015.  The capital conservation buffer requirements phase in over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2016.

 The following table shows the required capital ratios with the conservation buffer over the phase-in period.  
    
 | Basel III Community Banks | 
 | Minimum Capital Ratio Requirements | 
 | 2015 | | 2016 | | 2017 | 2018 | | 2019
Common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) | 4.500 | % | | 5.125 | % | 5.750 | % | | 6.375 | % | 7.000 | %
Tier I capital (to risk-weighted assets) | 6.000 | % | | 6.625 | % | 7.250 | % | | 7.875 | % | 8.500 | %
Total capital (to risk-weighted assets) | 8.000 | % | | 8.625 | % | 9.250 | % | | 9.876 | % | 10.500 | %
Tier I capital (to average assets, leverage) | 4.000 | % | | 4.000 | % | 4.000 | % | | 4.000 | % | 6.500 | %

          Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010: On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted into law.  The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry and includes provisions that, among other things: 

· | create the Financial Services Oversight Council to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | centralize the responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which will be responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | permanently raise the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250 thousand;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establish strengthened capital standards for banks, and disallowing trust preferred securities as qualifying as Tier 1 capital (subject to certain exceptions and grandfather provisions for existing trust preferred securities);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | amend the Truth in Lending Act with respect to mortgage originations and establishing new minimum mortgage underwriting standards;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | strengthen the SEC’s powers to regulate securities markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | grant the Federal Reserve Board the power to regulate debit card interchange fees;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Additionally the Dodd-Frank Act amended the BHCA to require the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading in designated types of financial instruments and investing in covered funds. This statutory provision, commonly known as the “Volcker Rule,” defines covered funds as hedge funds or private equity funds.  The Volcker rule places a number of limitations on a community bank were it to retain an ownership interest in a covered fund that it organized and offered. In particular, the community bank (including all its affiliates) must limit its total interest in each covered fund to no more than 3% of the ownership interests issued by the covered fund, and to no more than 3% of the value of the entire covered fund. In addition, the aggregate of all interests the community bank (together with its affiliates) has in all covered funds may not exceed 3 percent of the community bank’s tier 1 capital.  At December 31, 2016, the Company had $1.8 million invested in private equity funds, of which $203 thousand is invested by Royal Bank.  The Volker Rule did not have a material impact on the operations of the Company and/or Royal Bank.
 Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on the Company’s and Royal Bank’s operations is presently unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.
 FDIC Insurance Assessments: Royal Bank is a member of the FDIC.  The FDIC assigns each depository institution to one of several supervisory groups based on both capital adequacy and the FDIC's judgment of the institution's strength in light of

supervisory evaluations, including examination reports, statistical analyses and other information relevant to measuring the risk posed by the institution.  Each depositor is insured to at least $250 thousand.
 The assessment base used to calculate insurance premiums is a bank’s average assets minus average tangible equity.  The FDIC is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to establish assessment rates that will allow the Deposit Insurance Fund to achieve a reserve ratio of 1.35% of insured deposits by September 2020.  In attempting to achieve the mandated 1.35% ratio, the FDIC implemented assessment formulas that charge banks over $10 billion in asset size more than banks under that size.  Those new formulas do not affect Royal Bank.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is authorized to make reimbursements from the insurance fund to banks if the reserve ratio exceeds 1.50%, but the FDIC has adopted the “designated reserve ratio” of 2.0%.  In lieu of reimbursements, the FDIC has set lower base assessment rates if the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is equal to or exceeds 2.0%.
 In addition to deposit insurance, Royal Bank is also subject to assessments to pay the interest on Financing Corporation bonds.  The Financing Corporation was created by Congress to issue bonds to finance the resolution of failed thrift institutions.  Commercial banks and thrifts are subject to the same assessment for Financing Corporation bonds.  The FDIC sets the Financing Corporation assessment rate every quarter.  For the fourth quarter of 2016, the Financing Corporation’s assessment for Royal Bank (and all other banks), is an annual rate of $.0056 for each $100 of deposits.  The Financing Corporation bonds are expected to be paid off between 2018 and 2019.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002: The primary aims of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) was to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. SOX addresses, among other matters, requirements for audit committee membership and responsibilities, requirements of management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting, including certification of financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls by the primary executive officer and primary financial officer; established standards for auditors and regulation of audits, including independence provisions that restrict  non-audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients; and expanded the disclosure requirements for our Company insiders; and increased various civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of securities laws.
 USA Patriot Act of 2001: A major focus of governmental policy in recent years that impacts financial institutions has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The Patriot Act broadened anti-money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions and strengthened the ability of the U. S. Government to help prevent and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  The potential impact of the Patriot Act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide ranging.  The Patriot Act requires regulated financial institutions, among other things, to establish an anti-money laundering program that includes training and auditing components, to take additional precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts, and to comply with regulations related to verifying client identification at account opening. The Patriot Act also provides rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the requirements of the Patriot Act could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. We have implemented systems and procedures to meet the requirements of the regulation and will continue to revise and update policies, procedures and necessary controls to reflect changes required by the Patriot Act.
 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”), also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act, repeals the two anti-affiliation provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act.  GLBA establishes a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms, and other financial service providers.  It revises and expands the framework of the Holding Company Act to permit a holding company to engage in a full range of financial activities through a new entity known as a financial holding company.  “Financial activities” is broadly defined to include not only banking, insurance and securities activities, but also merchant banking and additional activities that the Federal Reserve Board, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature, incidental to such financial activities, or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally.
 In addition, GLBA provides a uniform framework for the functional regulation of the activities of banks, savings institutions and their holding companies; broadens the activities that may be conducted by national banks, banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies, and their financial subsidiaries; and adopts a number of provisions related to the capitalization, membership, corporate governance, and other measures designed to modernize the Federal Home Loan Bank system.

 Privacy provision: GLBA provides an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumer information.  The FDIC and other banking regulatory agencies, as required under GLBA, have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. Among other things, these provisions require banks and other financial institutions to have in place safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records, and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. GLBA also requires financial institutions to provide customers at the outset of the relationship and annually thereafter written disclosures concerning the institution’s privacy policies.  In 2015, GLBA was amended to eliminate the annual notification of written privacy policies by financial institutions, such as Royal Bank, that limit information sharing and post their privacy policies on their website.
 GLBA also expressly preserves the ability of a state bank to retain all existing subsidiaries.  Because Pennsylvania permits commercial banks chartered by the state to engage in any activity permissible for national banks, Royal Bank will be permitted to form subsidiaries to engage in the activities authorized by GLBA to the same extent as a national bank.  In order to form a financial subsidiary, Royal Bank must be well-capitalized, and would be subject to the same capital deduction, risk management and affiliate transaction rules as applicable to national banks.
 To the extent that GLBA permits banks, securities firms, and insurance companies to affiliate, the financial services industry may experience further consolidation.  GLBA is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis.  Nevertheless, this act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that the Company and Royal Bank face from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products, many of which may have substantially more financial resources than the Company and Royal Bank.
 Regulation W: Transactions between a bank and its “affiliates” are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under Sections 23A and 23B of Federal Reserve Act.  The FDIC Act applies Sections 23A and 23B to insured nonmember banks in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were members of the Federal Reserve System.  The Federal Reserve Board also issued Regulation W, which codifies prior regulations under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and interpretative guidance with respect to affiliate transactions.  Regulation W incorporates the exemption from the affiliate transaction rules but expands the exemption to cover the purchase of any type of loan or extension of credit from an affiliate.  Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, the bank’s holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank.  We are considered to be an affiliate of Royal Bank.  In general, subject to certain specified exemptions, a bank or its subsidiaries are limited in their ability to engage in “covered transactions” with affiliates:

· | To an amount equal to 10% of Royal Bank’s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with any one affiliate; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | To an amount equal to 20% of Royal Bank’s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with all affiliates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions and other specified transactions only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiary, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.  A “covered transaction” includes:

· | A loan or extension of credit to an affiliate;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | A purchase of, or an investment in, securities issued by an affiliate;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A purchase of assets from an affiliate, with some exceptions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | The acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any party; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | This issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, under Regulation W:

· | A bank and its subsidiaries may not purchase a low-quality asset from an affiliate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Covered transactions and other specified transactions between a bank or its subsidiaries and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | With some exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by a bank to an affiliate must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100% to 130%, depending on the type of collateral, of the amount of the loan or extension of credit.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Regulation W generally excludes all non-bank and non-savings association subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates, except to the extent that the Federal Reserve Board decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates.
 Concurrently with the adoption of Regulation W, the Federal Reserve Board has proposed a regulation which would further limit the amount of loans that could be purchased by a bank from an affiliate to not more than 100% of Royal Bank’s capital and surplus.
 Truth in Savings Act: The Truth in Savings Act (“Act”) was implemented in 1993.  The purpose of this Act is to require the clear and uniform disclosure of the rates of interest that are payable on deposit accounts by Royal Bank and the fees that are assessable against deposit accounts, so that consumers can make a meaningful comparison between the competing claims of banks with regard to deposit accounts and products.  This Act requires Royal Bank to include, in a clear and conspicuous manner, the following information with each periodic statement of a deposit account:  (1) the annual percentage yield earned; (2) the amount of interest earned; (3) the amount of any fees and charges imposed; and (4) the number of days in the reporting period. This Act allows for civil lawsuits to be initiated by customers if Royal Bank violates any provision or regulation under this Act.
 Real Estate Lending Guidelines: Pursuant to the FDICIA, the FDIC issued real estate lending guidelines that establish loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios for different types of real estate loans.  An LTV ratio is generally defined as the total loan amount divided by the appraised value of the property at the time the loan is originated.  If a bank does not hold a first lien position, the total loan amount would be combined with the amount of all senior liens when calculating the ratio.  In addition to establishing the LTV ratios, the FDIC’s real estate guidelines require all real estate loans to be based upon proper loan documentation and a recent independent appraisal of the property.
 The FDIC’s guidelines establish the following limits for LTV ratios:
    
Loan Category | LTV limit | 
Raw land | 65 | %
Land development | 65 | %
Construction: | | 
Commercial, multifamily (includes condos and co-ops) and other nonresidential | 80 | %
Improved property | 85 | %
Owner occupied 1-4 family and home equity (without credit enhancements) | 90 | %

      The guidelines provide exceptions to the LTV ratios for government-backed loans; loans facilitating the sale of real estate acquired by the lending institution in the normal course of business; loans where Royal Bank’s decision to lend is not based on the offer of real estate as collateral and such collateral is taken only out of an abundance of caution; and loans renewed, refinanced, or restructured by the original lender to the same borrower, without the advancement of new money.  The regulation also allows institutions to make a limited amount of real estate loans that do not conform to the proposed LTV ratios.  Under this exception, Royal Bank would be allowed to make real estate loans that do not conform to the LTV ratio limits, up to an amount not to exceed 100% of its total capital.
 Other Legislation/Regulatory Requirements: Congress and the federal banking agencies routinely propose new regulations.  The Company cannot predict how any new legislation, or new rules adopted by the federal banking agencies, may affect its business or the business of Royal Bank in the future.
 Monetary Policy
 The earnings of Royal Bank are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities including the Federal Reserve Board.  An important function of the Federal Reserve System is to influence the money supply and interest rates.  Among the instruments used to implement those objectives are open market operations in United States government securities, changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits and limitations on interest rates that member banks may pay on time and savings deposits.  These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans and investments and deposits.  Their use may also affect rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.
 The policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had and will probably continue to have a significant effect on its reserve requirements, deposits, loans and investment growth, as well as the rate of interest earned and paid, and are 

 
  13

 
expected to affect Royal Bank’s operations in the future.  The effect of such policies and regulations upon the future business and earnings of Royal Bank cannot be predicted.
 Effects of Inflation
 Inflation can impact the country’s overall economy, which in turn can impact the business and revenues of the Company and our subsidiaries.  Inflation has some impact on our operating costs.  Unlike many industrial companies, however, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature.  As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation.  Over short periods of time, interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as prices of goods and services. Available Information
