PART I | 
ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Raven Industries, Inc. (the Company or Raven) was incorporated in February 1956 under the laws of the State of South Dakota and began operations later that same year. The Company is a diversified technology company providing a variety of products to customers within the industrial, agricultural, energy, construction, and defense markets. The Company markets its products around the world and has its principal operations in the United States of America. Raven began operations as a manufacturer of high-altitude research balloons before diversifying into product lines that extended from technologies and production methods of this original balloon business. The Company employs approximately 910 people and is headquartered at 205 E. Sixth Street, Sioux Falls, SD 57104 - telephone (605) 336-2750. The Company's Internet address is http://www.ravenind.com and its common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol RAVN. The Company has adopted a Code of Conduct applicable to all officers, directors and employees, which is available on the website. Information on the Company's website is not part of this filing.
All reports (including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K) and proxy and information statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available through a link from the Company's website to the SEC website. All such information is available as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been electronically filed. Filings can also be obtained free of charge by contacting the Company or the SEC. The SEC can be contacted through its website at http://www.sec.gov or through the SEC's Office of FOIA/PA Operations at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, DC 20549-2736, or by calling the SEC at 1-800-732-0330.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company has three unique operating units, or divisions, that are also its reportable segments: Applied Technology Division (Applied Technology), Engineered Films Division (Engineered Films), and Aerostar Division (Aerostar). Many of the past and present product lines are an extension of technology and production methods developed in the original balloon business. Product lines have been grouped in these segments based on common technologies, production methods, and inventories; however, more than one business segment may serve each of the product markets identified above. The Company measures the profitability performance of its segments primarily based on their operating income excluding administrative and general expenses. Other expense and income taxes are not allocated to individual operating segments, and assets not identifiable to an individual segment are included as corporate assets. Segment information is reported consistent with the Company's management reporting structure.

Business segment financial information is found on the following pages of this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A (Form 10-K/A):

Applied Technology
Applied Technology designs, manufactures, sells, and services innovative precision agriculture products and information management tools that help growers reduce costs, decrease inputs, and improve farm yields around the world.  The Applied Technology product families include field computers, application controls, GPS-guidance and assisted-steering systems, automatic boom controls, planter controls, and harvest controls. Applied Technology's services include high-speed in-field Internet connectivity and cloud-based data management. The Company's investment in Site-Specific Technology Development Group, Inc. (SST), a software company, and the continued build-out of the Slingshot™ platform have positioned Applied Technology as an information platform that improves grower decision-making and business efficiencies for our agriculture retail partners.
Applied Technology sells its precision agriculture control products to both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and through aftermarket distribution partners in the United States and in most major agricultural areas around the world. Applied Technology has personnel and third-party distribution representatives located in the U.S. and key geographic areas throughout the world. The Company's competitive advantage in this segment is designing and selling easy to use, reliable, and innovative value-added products that are supported by an industry-leading service and support team.

Engineered Films
Engineered Films produces high-performance plastic films and sheeting for energy, agricultural, construction, geomembrane, and industrial applications.
Engineered Films primarily sells plastic sheeting to independent third-party distributors in each of the various markets it serves. Through the acquisition of Integra Plastics, Inc. (Integra) in November 2014, Engineered Films also leverages a direct sales channel in the division’s energy market. The Company extrudes a significant portion of the film converted for its commercial products and believes it is one of the largest sheeting converters in the United States in the markets it serves. Engineered Films believes its ability to both extrude and convert films allows it to provide a more customized solution to customers. A number of suppliers of sheeting compete with the Company on both price and product availability. Engineered Films is the Company's most capital-intensive business segment, and historically has made sizable investments in new extrusion capacity and conversion equipment. This segment's capital expenditures were $10.8 million in fiscal 2016, $8.2 million in fiscal 2015, and $6.7 million in fiscal 2014. 
Aerostar
Aerostar serves the defense/aerospace and situational awareness markets. Aerostar's products include high-altitude balloons, tethered aerostats, and radar processing systems. These products can be integrated with additional third-party sensors to provide research, communications, and situational awareness capabilities to governmental and commercial customers. Aerostar’s growth strategy emphasizes the design and manufacture of proprietary products in these markets. In previous years, Aerostar also provided contract manufacturing services. During this last year the Company largely exited this business. Net sales from contract manufacturing in fiscal 2016 were $4.7 million, compared to $31.7 million in fiscal 2015 and $51.3 million in fiscal 2014. The planned wind-down of contract manufacturing is now complete.
The acquisition of Vista Research, Inc. (Vista) in January 2012 positioned the Company to meet global demand for lower-cost target detection and tracking systems used by government agencies. Through Vista and a separate business venture that is majority-owned by the Company, Aerostar pursues potential product and support services contracts for agencies and instrumentalities of the U.S. government as well as sales of advanced radar systems, high-altitude balloons, and aerostats in international markets. In some cases, such sales will be Direct Commercial Sales to foreign governments rather than Foreign Military Sales through the U.S. government.
Aerostar sells to government agencies or commercial users primarily as a sub-contractor. The projects Aerostar bids on can be large-scale, with opportunities in the $10-$50 million range. Further, Direct Commercial Sales to foreign governments often involve large contracts subject to frequent delays because of budget uncertainties, regional military conflicts, and protracted negotiation processes. The timing of contract wins results in volatility in Aerostar’s results.
MAJOR CUSTOMER INFORMATION
No customers accounted for 10% or more of consolidated sales in fiscal 2016. Sales to Brawler Industrial Fabrics, a customer in the Engineered Films Division, accounted for 14%, and 13% of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2015 and 2014. 
SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
Some seasonal demand exists in Applied Technology's agricultural market. Applied Technology builds product in the fall for winter and spring delivery. Certain sales to agricultural customers offer spring payment terms for fall and early winter shipments. The resulting fluctuations in inventory and accounts receivable have required, and may require, seasonal short-term financing. 
Engineered Films also sees seasonal demand peak in the second and third fiscal quarters. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The principal financial instruments that the Company maintains are cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and acquisition-related contingent payments. The Company manages the interest rate, credit, and market risks associated with these accounts through periodic reviews of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and establishment of appropriate allowances in accordance with Company policies. The Company does not use off-balance sheet financing, except to enter into operating leases.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk. The use of these financial instruments has had no material effect on consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

RAW MATERIALS
The Company obtains a wide variety of materials from numerous vendors. Principal materials include electronic components for Aerostar and Applied Technology, various plastic resins for Engineered Films, and fabrics for Aerostar. Engineered Films has experienced volatile resin prices over the past three years. Price increases could not always be passed on to customers due to weak demand and a competitive pricing environment. Predicting future material volatility and the related potential impact on the Company is not possible.
PATENTS
The Company owns a number of patents. The Company does not believe that its business, as a whole, is materially dependent on any one patent or related group of patents. As the Company continues to develop more technology-based offerings, protection of the Company’s intellectual property has become an increasingly important strategic objective. Along with a more aggressive posture toward patenting new technology and protecting trade secrets, the Company has restrictions on the disclosure of our technology to industry and business partners to ensure that our intellectual property is maintained and protected.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The business segments conduct ongoing research and development efforts. Most of the Company's research and development expenditures are directed toward new product development, particularly in the Applied Technology Division. Total Company research and development costs are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company believes that, in all material respects, it is in compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Expenditures incurred in the past relating to compliance for operating facilities have not significantly affected the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
In connection with the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company's Glasstite, Inc. subsidiary in fiscal 2000, the Company agreed to assume responsibility for the investigation and remediation of any pre-October 29, 1999, environmental contamination at the Company's former Glasstite pickup-truck topper facility in Dunnell, Minnesota, as required by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) or the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
The Company and the purchasers of the Company's Glasstite subsidiary conducted environmental assessments of the properties. Although these assessments continue to be evaluated by the MPCA on the basis of the data available, the Company believes that any activities that might be required as a result of the findings of the assessments will not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The Company had $37 thousand accrued at January 31, 2016, representing its best estimate of probable costs to be incurred related to this and all other environmental matters.
BACKLOG
As of February 1, 2016, the Company's order backlog totaled approximately $18.6 million. Backlog amounts as of February 1, 2015 and 2014 were $26.7 million and $51.8 million, respectively. Because the length of time between order and shipment varies considerably by business segment and customers can change delivery schedules or potentially cancel orders, the Company does not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period.
EMPLOYEES 
As of January 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 910 employees. Following is a summary of active employees by segment: Applied Technology - 363; Engineered Films - 298; Aerostar - 175; and Corporate Services - 75. Management believes its employee relations are satisfactory.
