 Pending Merger with Renesas Electronics Corporation
 ﻿
 On September 12, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Renesas Electronics Corporation, a Japanese corporation (“Renesas”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Renesas will merge with and into Intersil (the “Merger”), with Intersil continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Renesas. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Intersil (“Class A common stock” or “common stock”), other than shares held by stockholders who have validly exercised their appraisal rights under Delaware law, and certain shares owned by Intersil, Renesas and their subsidiaries, will be automatically converted into the right to receive $22.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, plus, if applicable, the amount of any dividend which has a record date prior to the closing date of the Merger and a payment date after the closing date of the Merger.
 ﻿
 The consummation of the Merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of our stockholders, which we received on December 8, 2016, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. Consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. Closing of the Merger is expected in the first quarter of 2017.
 ﻿
 The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for us and Renesas, including if a governmental body prohibits the Merger or if the Merger is not consummated before July 12, 2017. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, we or Renesas will be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $96.5 million.
 ﻿
 We recorded transaction-related costs of $7.9 million, principally for outside financial advisory, legal, and related fees and expenses associated with the pending acquisition, in the year ended December 30, 2016. Additional transaction-related costs are expected to be incurred through the closing of the Merger.
 Business Strategy
 In 2013, we refocused our strategy to target the power management IC market, focusing our diverse product portfolio where our unique capabilities and the size of the market opportunity could enable sustained growth.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS

Industrial & Infrastructure
 Industrial & infrastructure products represented 64.8% of our revenue during 2016, 65.6% of our revenue in 2015, and 63.7% of our revenue in 2014. The largest component of this market category includes products for power, automotive, aerospace, and broad-line industrial applications. Power products include many of our most promising industrial & infrastructure products – digital power controllers, modules, and switching regulators, as well as other general purpose power devices. In automotive, we are targeting both infotainment and power applications. Our video decoders form a primary building block for console displays and rear view camera displays that are becoming a common safety feature in mid- to high-end vehicles and are required in all passenger cars in the U.S. beginning in 2018. We are applying our power management technology to expand our presence in infotainment and other opportunities within the automobile passenger cabin, and addressing the growing market for battery management within hybrid and fully electric vehicles. Our radiation-hardened products offer advantages for the most rigorous applications, including commercial aerospace, and make up another large component of our industrial & infrastructure revenue. Our computing heritage has resulted in a leading suite of products for analog and digital power management addressing the rapid expansion of cloud computing and communications infrastructure. Our products in this category also enable multiple functions in hundreds of other industrial systems from factory automation to test and measurement equipment.
 Computing & consumer
 Computing & consumer products represented 35.2% of our revenue during 2016, 34.4% of our revenue in 2015, and 36.3% of our revenue in 2014. This is the most competitive of our end-markets and is characterized by high volumes and short life cycles. We have proven over the years that our technology leadership, particularly in power management, can enable us to win designs in the industry’s highest profile computing and consumer devices. As we continue to develop higher value and more integrated solutions for the consumer market, we believe we can maintain a strong presence among the most innovative providers of consumer electronics.
 The computing and consumer market category includes desktop and mobile computers, mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, and other consumer applications.  We have a long history in the computing market, providing power controller integrated circuits, or ICs, to manage the PC core processor.  Our products leverage our patented modulation technology, which delivers leading light load efficiency, regulation accuracy, and fast dynamic response.  This typically results in better system power management and longer battery life.  In the consumer market, we have expanded our portfolio to address new opportunities in the latest mobile products, such as ultrabooks, tablets, and smartphones.  We now offer display power ICs and other power management products, such as buck boost converters designed to extend battery life in mobile devices.
 Geographic Financial Summary
 We operate exclusively in the semiconductor industry and primarily within the power management and high-performance analog sector of the industry. Substantially all of our revenue resulted from the sale of semiconductor products.  For the sale of products to distributors, original equipment manufacturers, and contract manufacturers, the assignment of a geographical location for such revenue is based on the location of the distributions, original equipment manufacturers, or contract manufacturers who purchased our product, which may differ from the geographic location of the end customer.

  ﻿
 One distributor, Avnet, Inc., represented 18.6%, 20.7%, and 18.4% of revenue during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and 21.9% and 17.8% of trade receivables as of December 30, 2016 and January 1, 2016, respectively.
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 We sell our products through our direct geographical salesforce and a network of distributors. Our sales team focuses on major accounts that are strategic to our marketing and product strategies. The direct geographical salesforce works closely with a network of distributors, value-added resellers, and manufacturers’ representatives, creating a worldwide selling network. Our dedicated direct geographical salesforce operates in the North American, European, Japanese and Asia/Pacific markets. We strategically locate our sales offices near major original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and contract manufacturers throughout the world. Our technical applications organization is deployed alongside our direct geographical salesforce, which helps ensure our focus on applications as well as products and customers. Our dedicated marketing organization supports field sales and is aligned by specific product group.  Our salesforce is supported by our worldwide customer service and logistics organizations.
 Distributors and value-added resellers handle a wide variety of products, including products sold by other companies that compete with our products. Most of our distributor agreements provide the distributors with protection from market price fluctuations and/or the right to return some unsold products. Some of our distribution agreements contain an industry-standard stock rotation provision allowing for minimum levels of inventory returns or scrap. Our distributors accounted for 51.9%, 56.8%, and 58.3% of our revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
 Research and Development 
 We believe that the continued introduction of new products in our target markets is essential to our growth. R&D expenses were $130.8 million, $126.4 million, and $125.9 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and 24.1%, 24.2%, and 22.4% of revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We believe that we must continue to innovate, enhance, and expand our products and services to maintain our leadership position and we intend to achieve this through our own R&D efforts, the licensing of technology, and selective acquisitions. As of December 30, 2016, we had 414 employees engaged in R&D. Manufacturing
 Our products are manufactured using silicon wafers. Our business is dependent upon the reliable fabrication, packaging, and testing of these silicon wafers. Our ICs are manufactured by leading foundry suppliers such as GlobalFoundries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and United Microelectronics Corporation. We also fabricate silicon wafers into ICs in our Florida manufacturing facility. During 2016, we internally produced 11.5% of our wafers and outsourced the manufacture of the remaining 88.5% to our foundry partners. 
 Following fabrication, the ICs are subject to packaging and testing processes. The majority of these processes are performed by independent subcontractors located in Malaysia, Taiwan, China, and the Philippines. We also maintain internal assembly and test capabilities for certain products in our Florida facility.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS

While we have not experienced any significant delay in obtaining raw materials, we rely exclusively on our foundry partners for sourcing silicon wafers, which are the critical building block of our products, for the ICs they manufacture on our behalf. As our dependency on outsourced foundry partners continues to increase, so does our risk of incurring a production-limiting shortfall. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we must allow for significant lead times for the delivery of certain raw materials. The production of ICs, from wafer fabrication through packaging and final testing, is generally expected to take eight to sixteen weeks to complete. We manufacture thousands of different products and our customers often require delivery within a short period of time following their order. To consistently meet these requirements, we maintain a substantial work-in-process and finished goods inventory. Manufacturing, assembly and testing of ICs is a complex process. Normal risks include errors and interruptions in the production process, defects and shortages in raw materials, disruptions at supplier locations, unexpected demand, as well as other risks, all of which can have an unfavorable impact to production costs, gross margins and our ability to meet customer demand. 
 On June 29, 2016, we began implementation of a plan to decommission our 200 millimeter wafer fabrication line in Palm Bay, Florida, or the 200mm Line.  The investment in the 200mm Line was made approximately four years ago to address the need to extend the production life of certain products manufactured at a third party wafer foundry when the supply commitments from the supplier for these products were set to expire at the end of 2014.  In July 2015, the supplier was acquired and the acquirer decided to continue long-term support for the manufacturing of these products. To avoid the future capital investment anticipated to be required for the 200mm Line, we determined it would be beneficial to our long-term cost structure to source the manufacturing for these products from this supplier and decommission our 200mm Line. Due to this shift in manufacturing to an outside provider, we recorded an impairment charge of $9.9 million during the quarter ended July 1, 2016 on these long-lived assets related to the 200mm Line. During the quarter ended December 30, 2016, we completed the sale of the long-lived assets related to the 200mm Line for $8.5 million and recognized the related gain of $1.1 million as an offset to the restructuring and related costs of $9.9 million recorded during the quarter ended July 1, 2016, resulting in a net restructuring and related costs charge of $8.8 million for the year ended December 30, 2016. For further detail, see Note 9, "Restructuring and Related Cost" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Backlog
 Our product sales are made pursuant to purchase orders that are generally booked up to six months in advance of delivery. Our standard terms and conditions of sale provide that these orders may not be cancelled or rescheduled after the date that is thirty days prior to the most current customer request date, or CRD, for standard products and after the date that is ninety days prior to the CRD for semi-custom and custom products. Backlog is influenced by several factors, including end-market demand, pricing, and customer order patterns. Additionally, backlog can fall faster than consumption rates in periods of weak end-market demand since production lead times can be shorter. Conversely, backlog can grow faster than consumption rates in periods of strong end-market demand as production and delivery times increase and some customers may increase orders in excess of their current consumption to reduce their own risk of production disruptions. The majority of our backlog for sales to distributors is valued at list price, which can be substantially higher than the prices ultimately recognized as revenue. Considering these practices and our experience, backlog alone cannot be consistently relied on to predict actual revenue for future periods. Seasonality
 The computing & consumer markets have historically experienced weaker demand in the first half of the year as compared to the second half of the year.
 Competition
 The power management and high-performance analog market is extremely competitive. We compete in our target markets with many companies that may have significantly greater resources than us, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Infineon, Linear Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, ON Semiconductor, and Texas Instruments. We compete on the basis of key intellectual property that enables advantages in technical performance, product features, customized design, price, availability, quality, reliability, sales and/or technical support. In addition, there has recently been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry.  If these or future acquisitions are successful, competition may intensify, and our competitors may have additional resources to compete against us.

Acquisitions 
 An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses, assets, products, or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce, or enhance our technological capabilities. From time-to-time, we consider acquisitions that may strengthen our business.
 On September 8, 2015, we acquired Great Wall Semiconductor Corporation (“GWS”), a privately held manufacturer of metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors. We acquired GWS to broaden our product portfolio to better serve our customers who purchase certain commercial and radiation-hardened power management products. 
 The purchase consideration consisted of $18.9 million in cash, of which $2.8 million was held by us for a period of 16 months and was subject to indemnification claims. In addition, the acquisition agreement provided for a cash earn-out payment of up to an additional $4.0 million if either specified revenue targets had been achieved or a disposition event had occurred on or before December 30, 2016. A disposition event would have included transfer of GWS or its assets, or a transfer of a majority of the assets or acquisition of Intersil by a third party. The conditions for the earn-out were not met and therefore no earn-out payment was required.
 Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Patents
 We own rights in trademarks, trade secrets, and patents that are important to our business. We acquire trademark rights through registration applications or trademark usage. We use trademarks to identify Intersil products and build brand awareness, including through periodic advertising. We seek to maintain our trade secrets through security measures, policies, and the use of confidentiality agreements. We also file patent applications to secure exclusive patent rights to potentially valuable inventions in the U.S. and in select foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is beneficial. We may, however, elect, in certain cases, not to seek patent protection for potentially valuable inventions, if we determine other forms of protection, such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret, to be more advantageous. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2017 to 2035. While our patents, trademarks, and trade secrets benefit us, we believe that our competitive position and future success is also determined by other factors, including our ability to innovate, our technical expertise, and our management ability. Employees
 Our worldwide workforce consisted of 970 employees as of December 30, 2016. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

Environmental Matters
 We believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with all applicable environmental requirements. Our costs and capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations have been immaterial during the last three years. However, we are subject to numerous federal, state, and international environmental laws and regulatory requirements. From time-to-time, we have become involved in investigations, lawsuits, or other claims regarding potential environmental issues at our facilities or former facilities (including those of companies we have acquired). Further, we may receive notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or equivalent state or international environmental agencies that allege that we are a potentially responsible party under various environmental protection laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly referred to as the Superfund Act, and/or equivalent laws. Such notices can assert potential liability for cleanup costs at various sites, which may include sites owned by us, sites we previously owned, and treatment or disposal sites not owned by us, allegedly containing hazardous substances attributable to us.  In correspondence dated September 28, 2015, counsel for Thomson Consumer Electronics Television Taiwan, Ltd., or TCETVT, notified us that it reserved its right to seek indemnification from us for any and all costs, fees, and expenses incurred as a result of a toxic tort class action lawsuit filed in Taiwan against TCETVT and others.  The lawsuit pertains to alleged injuries resulting from groundwater contamination at a manufacturing facility in Taiwan currently owned by TCETVT, which was previously owned and operated by predecessors, including General Electric, or GE, and Harris Corporation, or Harris, of our Taiwan subsidiary, Intersil Ltd. In the September 28 correspondence, TCETVT also informed us that the Taipei District Court entered a judgment of $18.5 million in the lawsuit against TCETVT, which judgment has been appealed. In addition, TCETVT informed us that they have incurred costs of $11.2 million in defending against the lawsuit through September 1, 2015.  We were also advised by TCETVT that additional claimants may be added to the lawsuit and TCETVT believes that if such additional claimants were successfully added, the resulting liability could be as high as $200.0 million.  In its September 28, 2015 letter, TCETVT informed us that it reserved its right to seek indemnification from us for any and all costs associated with the remediation of the contamination on that site and nearby areas. TCETVT claims they have incurred $15.9 million in remediation-related costs through September 1, 2015. 
 ﻿
 By letter dated June 22, 2016 from counsel for GE and by letter dated July 14, 2016 from counsel for TCETVT, we were advised that in April 2016 the Taiwan Supreme Court denied the request to add additional claimants to the existing lawsuit and that, in response to the denial, the plaintiffs filed a new, but related lawsuit, claiming damages on behalf of 1,147 new claimants as well as adding additional sites at which the toxic torts were alleged to have occurred, such that the resulting liability could be as high as an additional $225.0 million.
 ﻿
 Under the terms of the 1999 Master Transaction Agreement between Harris and Intersil, whereby Harris transferred its semiconductor business assets to us, environmental liabilities (including those associated with Harris’ Taiwan semiconductor operations) were expressly retained by Harris.  The Master Transaction Agreement also requires Harris to indemnify us for any and all costs relating to those retained environmental liabilities.  We have denied liability to TCETVT for the costs associated with the lawsuit as well as the costs associated with the remediation of the contamination on the site. We have also submitted a claim notice to Harris seeking defense and indemnification from Harris under the Master Transaction Agreement for any and all claims made by TCETVT in connection with this matter.  Harris has not yet agreed to indemnify us for the liability asserted by TCETVT.
