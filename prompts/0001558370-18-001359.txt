     Item 1. Business:
     The Company
     Calgon Carbon Corporation (the Company) is a global leader in innovative solutions, high quality products and reliable services designed to protect human health and the environment from harmful contaminants in water and air.  As a leading manufacturer of activated carbon, with broad capabilities in ultraviolet light disinfection, the Company provides purification solutions for drinking water, wastewater, pollution abatement, and a variety of industrial and commercial manufacturing processes.
     On September 21, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement under which a subsidiary of the Japanese chemical manufacturer Kuraray Co., Ltd. (Kuraray) agreed to acquire the Company, by way of a reverse triangular merger (Pending Merger).  Following the consummation of the Pending Merger, the Company would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuraray.  Refer to Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information regarding the Pending Merger.
     On November 2, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of the wood-based activated carbon, reactivation and mineral-based filtration media business of CECA, a subsidiary of Arkema Group (New Business).  Due to the complementary nature of the New Business’ products and market applications to those of the Company, and its significant exposure to less regulated, more traditional end markets, the addition of the New Business to the Company created a more balanced global platform from which the Company can continue to grow by leveraging its now expanded capabilities in the global activated carbon and adjacent filtration media market areas.
     Beginning January 1, 2017, the Company realigned its internal management reporting structure to incorporate the New Business into the existing business, and reorganized its current reportable segments.  The Company is reporting its results using the new reportable segment structure and has restated prior periods to conform to the change in reportable segments.
     The Company was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1967.

      For further information, refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
     Activated Carbon. The sale of activated carbon is the principal component of the Activated Carbon business segment.  The Company is recognized as the leading manufacturer of bituminous coal-based granular activated carbon.  Activated carbon is a porous material that removes organic compounds from liquids and gases by a process known as “adsorption.”  In adsorption, undesirable organic molecules contained in a liquid or gas are attracted and bound to the surface of the pores of the activated carbon as the liquid or gas is passed through.

 The primary raw material used in the production of the Company’s activated carbons is bituminous coal, which is crushed, sized and then processed in rotary kilns followed by high temperature furnaces.  This heating process is known as “activation” and develops the pore structure of the carbon.  Through adjustments in the activation process, pores of the required size and number are developed for a particular purification application.  The Company’s technological expertise in adjusting the pore structure in the activation process has been one of a number of factors enabling the Company to develop many special types of activated carbon available in several particle sizes.  The manufacturing and marketing of wood-based activated carbon and reactivation of coal-based activated carbon are also are included in the Activated Carbon business segment.  The Company also markets activated carbons produced by other manufacturers, as well as activated carbon produced from other raw materials, including coconut shells.
     With primary manufacturing facilities located in Catlettsburg, Kentucky, Pearlington, Mississippi, and Parentis-en-born, France, the Activated Carbon business segment produces and sells a broad range of activated, impregnated or acid washed carbons in granular, powdered or pellet form.  Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) particles are irregular in shape and generally used in fixed filter beds for continuous flow purification processes.  Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) is carbon that has been pulverized into powder and is often used in batch purification processes, in municipal water treatment applications and for flue gas emissions control.  Pelletized activated carbons are extruded particles, cylindrical in shape, and are typically used for gas phase applications due to the low pressure drop, high mechanical strength, and low dust content of the product.
     Another important component of the Activated Carbon business segment is the optional services that the Company makes available to purchasers of its products and systems.  It offers a variety of treatment services for customers including carbon supply, equipment leasing, installation and demobilization, transportation, and spent carbon reactivation.  Other services include feasibility testing, process design, performance monitoring, and major maintenance of Company-owned adsorption equipment.
     Along with providing activated carbon products, the Company has developed a portfolio of standardized, pre-engineered, activated carbon adsorption systems—for both liquid and vapor applications—which can be quickly delivered and easily installed at treatment sites.  Liquid phase equipment systems are used for potable water treatment, process purification, wastewater treatment, groundwater remediation, and de-chlorination.  Vapor phase equipment systems are used to control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, off gases from air strippers, and landfill gas production.
     Spent carbon reactivation and re-supply is a key focus of the Company’s service business.  In the reactivation process, the spent GAC is subjected to high temperature remanufacturing conditions that destroy the adsorbed organics and ensure that the activated carbon is returned to usable quality.  The Company is permitted to handle and reactivate spent carbons containing hazardous and non-hazardous organic compounds.
     Granular carbon reactivation is conducted at numerous locations throughout the world.  It is valuable to customers for both environmental and economic reasons, allowing them to reuse carbon cost-effectively without purchasing more expensive new carbon, and, at the same time, protecting natural resources.  The Company provides reactivation services in packages ranging from a thirty pound bag to truckload quantities.
     The Company’s custom reactivation process for United States (U.S.) municipal drinking water treatment plants is specially tailored to meet the unique demands of the drinking water industry.  Activated carbon reactivation for use in drinking water treatment facilities in the U.S. must adhere to requirements of the American Water Works Association (AWWA) standard B605.  Perhaps the most important requirement of this standard is that the reactivator must return to the municipality/water provider its own activated carbon that has been reactivated.  Unlike industrial activated carbon reactivation practiced by a number of carbon companies, where carbons from different customers can be co-mingled and reactivated as a pooled material, drinking water carbons are carefully segregated.  This means that a drinking water provider’s activated carbon is kept separate not only from industrial customers’ carbons, but also from the activated carbon of other providers’ activated carbon as well, to avoid any potential cross-contamination.  The Company maintains the integrity of each drinking water provider’s carbon, and its potable reactivation facilities and procedures strictly adhere to AWWA B605.  The Company’s Columbus, Ohio, North Tonawanda, New York, and Gila Bend, Arizona plants have received certification from the National Sanitation Foundation International (NSF) under NSF/ANSI Standard 61: Drinking Water System Components - Health Effects for custom reactivated carbon for potable water applications.  NSF International is an independent, not-for-profit organization committed to protecting and improving public health and the environment.

     European custom reactivation process maintains the segregation of drinking water provider’s activated carbon and ensures returned product fulfills the requirements of European Standard EN12915 as well as specific additional requirements as found in the United Kingdom Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) approval list of products and in the KIWA-ATA certification.  Custom reactivation for European municipal drinking water treatment plants is performed in reactivation facilities in Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Italy.  The site in Feluy, Belgium, which is accredited ISO9001 and ISO14001 for Quality and Environmental management systems, is the only carbon reactivation facility in the world with ISO22000 accreditation for Food Safety Management System (FSMS).
     Transportation services are offered via bulk activated carbon deliveries and spent carbon returns through the Company’s private fleet of trailers, capable of transporting both hazardous and non-hazardous material.  The Company will arrange transportation for packaged and smaller volumes of activated carbon in appropriate containers and small returnable equipment through a network of commercial and less-than-truckload carriers.
     Sales for the Activated Carbon segment were $547.0 million, $476.8 million, and $496.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
     Alternative Materials.  The primary products offered in the Alternative Materials segment are diatomaceous earth (DE) and perlite filtration media.  These products, which are primarily used as filter aids in beverage, food, and industrial applications, are marketed and distributed across the European region in relatively close proximity to their manufacturing locations.  The Alternative Materials segment also includes carbon cloth, which is activated carbon in cloth form.  Carbon cloth is manufactured in the United Kingdom (UK) and sold to the medical, military, and specialty markets.
     For the production of DE products, the Alternative Materials business segment is vertically integrated from the raw material source to the final product, as the Company owns two mineral deposit quarry sources which provide raw materials for the DE manufacturing processes.  DE is manufactured from diatomite, which is a lightweight and porous rock formed over many years by the successive accumulation and fossilization of the skeletal remains of single-cell algae – or diatoms – that lived in lakes, and were able to fix soluble silica on their shells.  These owned quarries each have 20 or more years of raw material reserves available.  The Company’s DE products, which are manufactured through a multi-step process that includes crushing, milling, calcination, and packaging, are sold throughout the European region under the broadly recognized Clarcel® brand name. 
     Perlite products, widely known in Europe as Randalite® and Randafil™, are manufactured from perlite ore, which is a silica rock of volcanic origin that contains fine water droplets.  In the Company’s manufacturing process, raw materials, which are procured from mines located in the Mediterranean region, are expanded at high temperature then crushed and grated into final product form.
     First developed in the 1970’s, activated carbon cloth was originally used in military clothing and masks to protect wearers against nuclear, biological and chemical agents.  Today, activated carbon cloth can be used in numerous additional applications, including sensor protection, filters for ostomy bags, wound dressings, conservation of artifacts, and respiratory masks.
     Sales for the Alternative Materials segment were $56.4 million, $14.4 million, and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
     Advanced Water Purification. Through its UV Technologies LLC subsidiary, the Company also manufactures and sells a broad line of UV (ultraviolet) light disinfection equipment.  Following the Company’s introduction of an advanced UV oxidation process to remediate contaminated groundwater, in 1998, its scientists invented a UV disinfection process used to inactivate Cryptosporidium, Giardia and other similar pathogens in surface water, rendering them harmless to humans.  In combination with hydrogen peroxide, UV light is effective in destroying many contaminants common in groundwater remediation applications.  The Company participates in the marketplace for innovative UV technologies with its Sentinel® line designed to protect municipal drinking water supplies from pathogens, the C3 Series™ open-channel wastewater disinfection product line for municipal wastewater disinfection, and Rayox® UV advanced oxidation equipment for treatment of contaminants in groundwater, process water, and industrial wastewater. UV oxidation equipment can also be combined with activated carbon to provide effective solutions for taste and odor removal in municipal drinking water and for water reuse.
