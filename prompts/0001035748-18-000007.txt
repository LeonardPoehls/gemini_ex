Recent Development
On January 29, 2018, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with SAP America, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“SAP”) and Emerson One Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP (“Merger Sub”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into Callidus Software Inc. and we will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP (the “Merger”). If the Merger is completed, our stockholders will be entitled to receive $36.00 in cash for each share of our common stock owned by them as of the date of the Merger.
The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement by holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote thereon, (ii) the accuracy of our, SAP’s and Merger Sub’s respective representations and warranties, subject to specified materiality qualifications, (iii) the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, as well as any similar filings and clearances under certain foreign antitrust laws (the “Regulatory Approvals”), (iv) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement), and (v) other customary conditions.
The special meeting of our stockholders to vote on adoption of the Merger Agreement will be held on March 29, 2018. If our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting and all Regulatory Approvals are received prior to such time, Callidus and SAP currently anticipate that all other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement will either be satisfied or waived, and closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will occur, within three International Business Days (as defined in the Merger Agreement) after the special meeting.

Sales and Marketing
We sell and market our software primarily through a direct sales force and in conjunction with our external partners. In the United States, we have sales and service offices in Dublin, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; New York, New York; Meridian, Idaho; and Vancouver, Washington. Outside the United States, we have sales and service offices in Australia, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Serbia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. 

Sales. Our Enterprise direct sales force, which consists of account executives, technical pre-sales engineers and field management, is responsible for the sale of our products to global enterprises across multiple industries. Our Enterprise sales force is organized along selected vertical industries and geographically to focus on market access. We also have an inside sales division that sells our learning, marketing and customer experience solutions to businesses of all sizes across all industries.
Marketing. Our marketing activities include product and customer marketing functions as well as marketing communications. The function of our product marketing is to define new product requirements, manage product life cycles, and generate content for sales collateral and marketing programs. The function of our customer marketing is to provide customer references and reviews and work with customers to produce case studies and testimonials. The function of our marketing communications is to focus on both primary demand generation efforts to increase awareness of sales effectiveness, product solutions and secondary demand generation efforts to drive sales leads for our solutions. This is done through multiple channels, including advertising, web casts, industry events, conferences, email marketing, digital marketing, web marketing and telemarketing. In addition, our corporate website is optimized to drive prospects to our Lead to Money solutions.
Alliances and Partnerships
We actively promote and maintain strategic relationships with systems integrators, consulting organizations, independent software vendors, value-added resellers, and technology providers. These relationships provide both customer referrals and co-marketing opportunities, which have contributed to the expansion of our customer base. We have established alliances with partners such as Accenture, Canidium, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Consulting, OpenSymmetry, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Tata Consulting Services to service our customers nationally and internationally. We have also expanded our relationship with technology partners such as Docusign, Microsoft, NetSuite, Salesforce and SAP that collaborate with us in selling our solutions.
Competition
Our principal competition comes from Oracle, International Business Machines ("IBM") and the internally-developed software solutions deployed at potential customers. We also compete with other software and consulting companies, which typically focus on specific industries or sectors, including:

• | Sales: Apttus, IBM, Pros, SAVO Group and Xactly Corporation

•Marketing: Marketo, Oracle and Hubspot
•Learning: Adobe Systems, Cornerstone On-demand, SABA Software and SumTotal Systems
•Customer Experience: Allegiance, Qualtrics and Medallia
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are:
•ability to offer a broad suite of solutions across the Lead to Money cycle;
•industry-specific domain expertise;
•scalability and flexibility of solutions;
•quality of customer service;
•total cost of ownership; and
•ease of use.
We believe that we compete effectively with other established enterprise software companies due to our broad suite of solutions beyond core commission management, established market leadership, domain expertise, and our highly scalable architecture. Furthermore, we believe we have developed the domain expertise necessary to meet the dynamic requirements of our customers' complex and growing sales performance and sales effectiveness programs.

We believe that our products offer customers a more cost-effective and more extensive alternative to their internally-developed solutions, which are generally expensive, inflexible and difficult to maintain, particularly for companies with increasingly complex sales performance programs and sales channels. We also believe that our suite of SaaS-based solutions for the spectrum of Lead to Money functions has advantages over multiple single-point solutions, including cost-effectiveness, ease of implementation and ease of use.
With respect to our offerings in specific industry verticals, we believe that we have developed breadth and depth of functionality demanded by those specific markets, and we have differentiated our products by adding features that are specific to each target market and that scale to growing business needs.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. While we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property, we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, product enhancements, and reliable product support are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position.
Our customer agreements include restrictions intended to protect and defend our intellectual property rights. We also require our employees, contractors and many others with whom we have business relationships to sign confidentiality agreements.
Some of our products include licensed third-party software, but we believe that such software is commercially available and that there are other commercially available substitutes that can be integrated with our products on reasonable terms. We also believe that in some cases, we could develop substitute technology to replace third-party software if the third-party licenses were no longer available on reasonable terms.
While our patents are an important part of our success, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one patent or on a combination of any or all of our patents.
Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,300 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
