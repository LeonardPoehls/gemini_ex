(the “Company”) of $47.6 million. In addition, we had Adjusted EBITDA of $209.7 million and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017. (Item 7 of this Annual Report includes a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure).
 ﻿
 We believe that our engineering, manufacturing, and program management capabilities, our competitive cost and quality, our financial discipline, and our colleague engagement position us for long-term success.
 ﻿
 Our History and Corporate Structure 
 Our Corporate History
 On October 15, 2010, our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange following our initial public offering (“IPO”). On July 31, 2013, Tower International Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of Cerberus, completed the sale of 7,888,122 shares of our common stock in a secondary public offering. Upon completion of the sale, Cerberus no longer controlled a majority of our outstanding common stock and therefore, we ceased being a “controlled company” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards. On November 6, 2013, Tower International Holdings, LLC, completed the sale of 3,000,000 shares of our common stock in another secondary public offering. In addition, Tower International Holdings, LLC completed multiple transactions during the fourth quarter of 2013 whereby it sold additional shares of our common stock in the open market. As a result of these sales, Tower International Holdings, LLC and Cerberus held no shares of our common stock at December 31, 2013.
 ﻿
 Sale of China Joint Ventures
 On December 6, 2015, the Company completed the sale of its equity interest in its Xiangtan DIT Automotive Products Co. Ltd. (“Xiangtan”) joint venture. The sale agreement provided for the repayment of $9.9 million of the Company’s shareholder loans to the joint venture, and the purchase of the Company’s equity in the joint venture for $3.5 million, net of tax.
 ﻿
 On December 31, 2015, the Company completed the sale of its equity interest in its Changchun Tower Golden Ring Automotive Products Co., Ltd. (“TGR”) joint venture. The sale agreement provided for the purchase of the Company’s equity in the joint venture for $29.4 million, and the payment of a dividend of $14.8 million, net of tax.
 ﻿
 In October of 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its joint venture in Wuhu, China: Tower Automotive Company, Ltd. (“Wuhu”). The sale agreement provided for the purchase of the Company’s equity in the joint venture for approximately $21 million, net of tax. The Company received proceeds of $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On May 9, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its equity interest in Wuhu. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company received total net proceeds of $15.9 million related to the sale, which resulted in a total sales price that was less than the carrying value of the net assets of Wuhu. In addition, the Company incurred certain transaction related costs; therefore, a net loss of $2.6 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2017.
 ﻿
 Xiangtan, TGR, and Wuhu have been presented as discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 205, Discontinued Operations.    ﻿
 Also, in October of 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its joint venture in Ningbo, China: Tower DIT Automotive Products Co., Ltd. (“Ningbo”). The agreement is subject to Chinese government approval. The sale agreement provides for purchase of the Company’s equity in the joint venture for approximately $4 million, net of tax. The Company anticipates that this transaction will close in the first quarter of 2018.
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2017, our China joint venture in Ningbo has been presented as discontinued operations, and is considered held for sale in accordance with FASB ASC No. 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and FASB ASC No. 205, Discontinued Operations.

Brazil Discontinued Operation
 On December 21, 2015, the Company sold one of its two operations in Brazil. Net cash proceeds from this sale were $9.5 million.   During the second quarter of 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to sell the Company’s remaining business operations in Brazil. At December 31, 2017, the remaining Brazilian business operations are considered held for sale in accordance with FASB ASC No. 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with FASB ASC No. 205, Discontinued Operations.
 ﻿
 Our Industry
 We believe OEMs produce a majority of their structural metal components and assemblies internally. While OEM policies differ and may be especially impacted by their own capacity utilization, the capital expenditures associated with internal production of the types of parts and assemblies Tower manufactures can be substantial. As fuel efficiency and emissions regulations tighten globally, the continued lightweighting and electrification of vehicles is expected. Due to the capital investment and fixed cost requirements for the OEMs related to these trends as well as the evolution toward autonomous vehicles, we believe that longer term, OEMs will outsource a greater proportion of their stamping requirements and we may benefit from this shift. We also believe that our products are relatively agnostic to vehicle autonomy because the stampings and assemblies we produce are critical to the structural integrity of a vehicle and not dependent upon the powertrain or how vehicles are driven. In addition, we believe OEMs will increasingly favor larger, more capable, financially strong regional suppliers. Given our manufacturing, engineering, and operational program management capabilities, we believe we are particularly well-positioned in North America and Europe to take advantage of these potential opportunities.
 ﻿
 Our Strategy
 We seek to:

· | Execute a business model that generates sustainable ongoing free cash flow, providing flexibility for capital allocation and resilience during cyclical downturns;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Achieve organic growth above industry levels through strong competitive capabilities in engineering, manufacturing, and program management that contribute to leading positions in cost and quality;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Opportunistically pursue accretive acquisitions;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Achieve and maintain appropriate net debt leverage of about 1 times Adjusted EBITDA, which we consider to be integral to a financially strong and capable automotive parts supplier;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Return capital to shareholders through regular growing dividends, stock repurchases and, when appropriate, other actions; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Manage risk through financial discipline.
--+------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Execute Business Model Focused on Free Cash Flow
 Free cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for purchases of property, plant and equipment) is one of our most important financial metrics. Our focus on sustainable ongoing free cash flow keeps us disciplined regarding product pricing and margins, as well as determining and prioritizing affordable capital expenditures. To further our alignment with our business model, free cash flow is a major component of our annual bonus program for salaried and hourly colleagues. (Item 7 of this Annual Report includes a discussion of free cash flow as a non-GAAP measure).
 ﻿
 Achieve Organic Growth Above Industry and Opportunistically Pursue Accretive Acquisitions
 We have demonstrated the ability to win significant net new business from our customers from a combination of share gains from competitors via conquest wins and OEM outsourcing. In addition, the increased use of aluminum, higher strength steels and hot forming (i.e., “light weighting”) with complex joining technologies is providing us with higher value-add opportunities. We believe our ability to win new business at a return in excess of our cost of capital is a direct reflection of our core engineering strength, competitive cost and quality, and proven ability to manage complex new-model launches for OEM customers. We use processes such as Lean Six Sigma, labor best practices standardization, and advanced product quality planning (“APQP”) to drive productivity and quality while managing new programs on time and on budget.    ﻿
 We believe Tower is positioned for organic growth well above industry from 2018 through at least 2020 as a result of major new business awards primarily in North America that are anticipated to provide approximately $350 million of annual ongoing net revenue.  We also believe there can be future upside growth opportunities from accretive acquisitions. Our projections regarding future performance constitute forward-looking statements. For information regarding the risks associated with forward looking statements, see “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

Achieve and Maintain Appropriate Leverage
 Achieving and maintaining net debt leverage (defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by annual Adjusted EBITDA) at our target of 1 times Adjusted EBITDA is an important business priority for optimizing cost of capital and maintaining appropriate financial strength. As of December 31, 2017, our net debt was $263.1 million, representing net debt leverage of 1.3 times. (Item 7 of this Annual Report includes a discussion of net debt as a non-GAAP measure).
 ﻿
 During the last two years, we have entered into operating leases to fund a portion of the capital expenditures necessary to achieve growth above industry average. We believe that these operating leases provide a diversified capital source for financing capital expenditures at competitive rates. These leasing arrangements bear a weighted average fixed interest rate of 5.4%. As of December 31, 2017, the effective interest rate on our Term Loan Credit Facility (the “Term Loan”) was 4.2%.
 ﻿
 Beginning in 2019, FASB ASC No. 842, Leases, will change the financial reporting for leases. Certain of our manufacturing equipment leases currently classified as operating leases will be considered financing leases under the new standard. As a result, we will be required to record a right of use asset as additional property, plant, and equipment and the associated liability as lease debt.
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2017, the associated liability from these leases would have been approximately $72 million. Including our net debt of $263.1 million, our pro-forma leverage including these leases represents net debt leverage of 1.6 times.
 ﻿
 In addition, we have numerous real estate and equipment leases currently classified as operating that we believe will continue to be classified as operating under the new standard. We expect that the right of use assets and liabilities associated with these leases will be material, but have not yet quantified the total balance sheet impact for these leases.
 ﻿
 Return Capital to Shareholders
 With our long-term leverage target in sight, we have begun returning capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Tower raised its regular quarterly dividend per common share by 9%. In addition, on June 17, 2016, the Company announced its Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase up to $100 million of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock from time to time in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions (the “Repurchase Program”). As of December 31, 2017, 829,648 shares have been purchased for $18.9 million under the Repurchase Program.
 ﻿
 Manage Risk
 We consider risk management to be an important part of our ability to operate predictably and successfully in the cyclical automotive parts industry. Foremost in managing risk is financial discipline, beginning during the evaluation and approval of new programs to ensure sound assumptions and projected returns in excess of our cost of capital. During each year, we carefully monitor and manage all elements of cost, with an objective of achieving productivity and other savings that offset customer price reductions and labor and overhead inflation. Through our commercial agreements, we are largely shielded from changes in steel prices.
 ﻿

 Our Products
 We produce a broad range of structural components and assemblies, many of which are critical to the structural integrity of a vehicle. Images of some of the products we offer are presented below.
﻿ 
-----------------
﻿ 
Product Offerings
﻿ 

  Body structures and assemblies 
 Body structures and assemblies form the basic upper body structure of the vehicle and include structural metal components such as body pillars, roof rails, and side sills. This category also includes Class A surfaces and assemblies, which are components of the “exterior skin” of the vehicle—body sides, hoods, doors, fenders, and pickup truck boxes. These components form the appearance of the vehicle, requiring flawless surface finishes. 
 ﻿
 Chassis and lower vehicle structures 
 Lower vehicle frames and structures include chassis structures that make up the “skeleton” of a vehicle and which are critical to overall performance, particularly in the areas of noise, vibration and harshness, handling, and crash management. These products include pickup truck and SUV full frames, automotive engine and rear suspension cradles, floor pan components, and cross members that form the basic lower body structure of the vehicle. These heavy gauge metal stampings carry the load of the vehicle, provide crash integrity, and are critical to the strength and safety of vehicles.
 ﻿
 Complex body-in-white assemblies 
 Complex body-in-white assemblies are comprised of multiple components and sub-assemblies welded to form major portions of the vehicle’s body structure. We refer to body-in-white as the manufacturing stage in which the vehicle body sheet metal has been assembled but before the components and trim have been added. Examples of complex assemblies include front and rear floor pan assemblies and door/ pillar assemblies. 
 ﻿
 Product mix
 We believe we have a diversified product group mix, as each of our product groups individually accounted for 20% or more of our revenues in 2017. The following table summarizes our product group mix as a percent of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017:

 International Operations 
 We have significant manufacturing operations outside the United States, including Europe and Mexico. In 2017, 36% of our revenues originated outside the United States. For information regarding potential risks associated with our international operations, see Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry and Our Business — “Our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries”. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our international operations.
 ﻿
 Manufacturing and Operations 
 Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of stamping and welding operations, system and modular assembly operations, cold and hot forming, coating, and other ancillary operations. Stamping involves passing metal through dies in a stamping press to form the metal into three-dimensional parts. We produce stamped parts using precision single-stage, progressive, and transfer presses, ranging in size from 100 to 4,500 tons, which perform multiple functions to convert raw material into finished products. We invest in our press technology to increase flexibility, improve safety, and minimize die changeover time.
 ﻿
 We feed stampings into assembly operations that produce complex assemblies through the combination of multiple parts that are welded or fastened together. Our assembly operations are performed on either dedicated, high-volume welding/fastening machines or on flexible, cell-oriented robotic lines. The assembly machines attach additional parts, fixtures, or stampings to the original metal stampings. In addition to standard production capabilities, our assembly machines are also able to perform various statistical control functions and identify improper welds and attachments. 
 ﻿
 Our products use various grades and thicknesses of steel and aluminum, including high–strength, hot- and cold-rolled, galvanized, organically coated, stainless, and aluminized steel. Although changing steel prices affect our results, we seek to be neutral with respect to steel pricing over time, with the intention of neither making nor losing money as steel prices fluctuate. The pricing of our products includes a component for steel which can increase as steel prices increase and decrease as steel prices decrease. For our North American customers and several of our other customers, we purchase steel through our customers’ resale programs, where our customers actually negotiate the cost of steel for us. In other cases, we procure steel directly from the mills, negotiating our own price and seeking to pass through steel price increases and decreases to our customers.
 ﻿
 Our hot forming technology provides customers with ultra-high strength steels (“UHSS”) for automotive body structures. Demand for UHSS is increasing to allow conformance to additional regulatory requirements for fuel economy – through mass reduction – while maintaining vehicle safety.
 ﻿
 We focus on achieving superior product quality at the lowest operating costs possible and concentrate on improving our manufacturing processes to drive out inefficiencies. We seek to continually improve our processes through efforts to improve our cost competitiveness and achieve higher quality.
 ﻿
 We are committed to sustaining Lean Six Sigma principles throughout our manufacturing processes and as of December 31, 2017, we employed 92 certified black belts. We utilize Lean Six Sigma principles to increase the efficiency of our operations and to reduce operating costs, thereby improving our cost competitiveness. We have accomplished efficiency improvements, while at the same time improving our quality.
 ﻿
 Supply Base—Manufactured Components and Raw Materials 
 We purchase various manufactured components and raw materials for use in our manufacturing processes. All of these components and raw materials are available from numerous sources. We employ just-in-time manufacturing and sourcing systems, enabling us to meet customer requirements for faster deliveries, while minimizing our need to carry significant inventory levels. The primary raw material used to produce the majority of our products is steel. A portion of our steel is purchased from certain of our customers through various 

 
9


 
OEM resale programs. The remainder of our steel purchasing requirements are met through contracts with steel producers and market purchases. In addition, we procure small- and medium-sized stampings, fasteners, tubing, and rubber products. 
 ﻿
 Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 
 Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to create awareness of our engineering, program management, manufacturing and assembly expertise, and to translate our leadership position into contract wins. We have developed a sales team that consists of an integrated group of professionals, including skilled engineers and program managers, whom we believe provide the appropriate mix of operational and technical expertise needed to interface successfully with OEMs. We sell directly to OEMs through our sales and engineering teams at our technical centers, which are strategically located around the world. Bidding on automotive OEM platforms typically encompasses many months of engineering and business development activity. We integrate our sales force directly into our operating team and work closely with our customers throughout the process of developing and manufacturing a product. Our proximity to our customer base enables us to enjoy close relationships with our customers and positions us well to seek future business awards. 
 ﻿
 Customers 
 We have developed long-standing business relationships with our automotive customers around the world. We work together with our customers in various stages of production, including development, component sourcing, quality assurance, manufacturing, and delivery. With a diverse mix of products and facilities in major markets worldwide, we believe we are well-positioned to meet customer needs. We believe we have a strong, established reputation with customers for providing high-quality products at competitive prices, as well as for timely delivery and customer service. Given that the automotive OEM business involves long-term production contracts awarded on a platform-by-platform basis, we believe that we can leverage our strong customer relationships to obtain new platform awards. Contracts are typically sole-sourced to one supplier for individual platforms.
 ﻿
 Customer Support 
 We have six engineering and sales locations throughout the world, including a 24-hour engineering support center in India. We believe that we provide effective customer solutions, products, and service to our customers. Our customer service group is organized into customer-dedicated teams within regions to provide more focused service to our clients. 
 ﻿
 Seasonality   
 Our customers in North America and Europe typically shut down vehicle production during portions of July - August and for one week in late December. Our quarterly results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity may be impacted by these seasonal practices. For example, working capital is typically a use of cash during the first quarter of the year and a source of cash generation in the fourth quarter. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on working capital.
 ﻿
 Competition 
 We principally compete for new business at the beginning of the development of new models and on the redesign of existing models. New-model development generally begins two to three years before the marketing of such models to the public. Once a supplier has been designated to supply parts for a new program, an OEM will usually continue to purchase those parts from the designated producer for the life of the program, although not necessarily for a major redesign. OEMs typically evaluate suppliers based on many criteria such as quality, price/cost competitiveness, system and product performance, reliability and timeliness of delivery, new product and technology development capability, excellence and flexibility in operations, location relative to the customer’s assembly plant, effectiveness of customer service, and overall management capability. 
 ﻿
 We believe that we compete effectively with other leading suppliers in our sector. Our main tier one competitors include: Magna International, Inc. (Cosma division), Gestamp Automocion, Martinrea International, Metalsa, S.A. de C.V., Gruppo Magnetto, and Benteler Automotive. We compete with other competitors with respect to certain of our products and in particular geographic markets. The number of our competitors has decreased in recent years and we believe that number will continue to decline due to supplier consolidation. In addition, most of our OEM customers manufacture similar products that compete with our products. We believe the recent trend has been for OEMs, on average, to increase outsourcing, and we expect that trend to continue, which may provide above-industry growth opportunities for key suppliers like Tower.
 ﻿
 Joint Ventures 
 In the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements in principle to sell our two remaining joint ventures in China: Wuhu and Ningbo. As of December 31, 2017, we had completed the sale of Wuhu and expect to complete the sale of Ningbo during the first quarter of 2018.
 ﻿

Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 7,600 employees worldwide, of whom approximately 4,400 were covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire at various times. We are not aware of any significant work stoppages since the formation of Tower Automotive Inc., our predecessor (the “Predecessor Company”), in 1993. A prolonged strike or slow-down by one of our unions could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. 
 ﻿
 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to various domestic and foreign Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and health and safety, including those regulating the following: soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal, and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of materials, including greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. We have taken steps to comply with the numerous and sometimes complex laws, regulations, and permits. We have also achieved ISO 14001 registration for substantially all of our facilities, which means we have implemented environmental management systems to improve our environmental performance. Compliance with environmental requirements has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position and we have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures pursuant to such requirements. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to fines, penalties, enforcement actions, or lawsuits. 
 ﻿
 Environmental laws, regulations, and permits, and the enforcement thereof, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. In particular, more rigorous GHG emission requirements are in various stages of development. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“U.S. EPA”) has promulgated the GHG Reporting Rule, which requires reporting of GHG data and other relevant information from large sources and suppliers in the United States and the GHG Tailoring Rule, which requires certain facilities with significant GHG emissions to obtain emissions permits under the authority of the Clean Air Act (typically limited to only the largest stationary sources of GHGs.) The United States Congress has also considered imposing additional restrictions on GHG emissions. Any additional regulation of GHG emissions by either the United States Congress and/ or the U.S. EPA could include a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement, or other program, and could subject us to significant costs, including those relating to emission credits, pollution control equipment, monitoring, and reporting, as well as increased energy and raw material prices. In addition, our OEM customers may seek price reductions from us to account for their increased costs resulting from GHG regulations. Further, growing pressure to reduce GHG emissions from mobile sources could reduce automobile sales, thereby reducing demand for our products, and ultimately our revenues. At this time, none of our facilities are required to report GHG emissions or participate in any cap-and-trade system programs under the existing regulatory scheme. However, there is still significant uncertainty surrounding the scope, timing, and effect of future GHG regulation, and any changes to the current laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, product demand, and liquidity.    ﻿
 We are also responsible for certain costs relating to contamination at our, or the Predecessor Company’s, current or formerly owned or operated properties or third party waste disposal sites, even if we are not at fault. Certain locations have been impacted by environmental releases and soil or groundwater contamination is being addressed at certain of these sites. In addition to potentially significant investigation and remediation costs, contamination can give rise to third party claims, including fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury, or property damage. Our costs and liabilities associated with environmental contamination could be substantial and may be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Refer to Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our environmental liabilities.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors    Our business is subject to a number of risks. In addition to the various risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following risk factors should be considered.    ﻿
 Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry and Our Business
 A downturn in the global economy could adversely affect demand for automobiles that are manufactured with our products and therefore, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 The level of demand for our products depends primarily upon the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are manufactured with our products. As experienced in 2008 and 2009, a global economic recession can have a significant adverse effect on our business, customers, and suppliers, and can contribute to delayed and reduced purchases of automobiles, including those manufactured with our products. If the global economy were to undergo a significant downturn, depending upon its length, duration, and severity, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. 
 ﻿
 Demand for and pricing of our products is also subject to economic conditions and other factors (e.g., energy costs, fuel costs, climate change concerns, vehicle age, consumer spending and preferences, materials used in production, changing technology, etc.) present in the various domestic and international markets in which our products are sold.  
 ﻿
 We may be unable to realize revenues represented by our awarded business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 The realization of future revenues from awarded business is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that our customers will actually produce, the timing of that production, and the mix of options that our customers may choose. 
 ﻿
 In addition to not having a commitment from our customers regarding the minimum number of products they must purchase from us if we obtain awarded business, the terms and conditions of the agreements with our customers typically provide that they have the contractual right to unilaterally terminate our contracts with them without notice or with only limited notice. If such contracts are terminated by our customers, our ability to obtain compensation from our customers for such termination is generally limited to the direct out-of-pocket costs that we incurred for raw materials and work-in-progress, and in certain instances, un-depreciated capital expenditures.
 ﻿
 We base a substantial part of our planning on the anticipated lifetime revenues of particular products. We calculate the lifetime revenues of a product by multiplying our expected price for a product by the forecasted production volume for that product during the length of time we expect the related vehicle to be in production. In addition to applying our experienced judgment to customer projections, we use IHS, a third-party forecasting service, to provide long-term forecasts, which allow us to determine how long a vehicle is expected to be in production. If we over-estimate the production units or if a customer reduces its level of anticipated purchases of a particular platform as a result of reduced demand, our actual revenues for that platform may be substantially less than the lifetime revenues we had anticipated for that platform.
 ﻿
 Typically, it takes two to three years from the time a manufacturer awards a program until the program is launched and production begins. In many cases, we must commit substantial resources in preparation for production under awarded customer business well in advance of the customer’s production start date. We cannot provide assurance that our results of operations will not be materially adversely affected in the future if we are unable to recover these types of pre-production costs related to our customers’ cancellation of awarded business or if projected volumes are not attained.
 ﻿
 The automobile industry is highly cyclical and a downturn would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 ﻿
 Our business is directly related to the volume of automotive production. Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, consumer preferences, patterns of consumer spending, fuel costs, and the automobile replacement cycle. Automotive production and sales may fluctuate significantly from year-to-year and such fluctuations may give rise to changes in demand for our products. Because we have significant fixed production costs, declines in our customers’ production levels can have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 ﻿
 The highly cyclical nature of the automotive industry presents a risk that is outside our control and that cannot be accurately predicted. Moreover, a number of factors that we cannot reasonably predict could affect cyclicality in the automotive industry, and have affected cyclicality in the past. Decreases in demand for automobiles generally, or decreases in demand for our products in particular, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 ﻿


 
13


 
Our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries.
 Our international operations include manufacturing facilities in Europe and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 36% of our revenues were derived from operations outside the United States. Our international operations are subject to various risks that could have a material adverse effect on those operations and our business as a whole, including, but not limited to, exposure to the following in certain locations:
 ﻿

· | local economic and political conditions;
--+-----------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | local civil and social unrest, including any resultant acts of war, terrorism or similar events;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | local public health issues;
--+----------------------------

  ﻿

· | local tax requirements and obligations;
--+----------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
--+---------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | high inflationary conditions;
--+------------------------------

  ﻿

· | the risk of government-sponsored competition;
--+----------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | legal and regulatory concerns, including difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting receivables;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | controls on the repatriation of cash, including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | export and import restrictions;
--+--------------------------------

  ﻿

· | the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;
--+-------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | labor disruptions and operational shutdowns;
--+---------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | natural and man-made disasters; and
--+------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | local environmental regulations.
--+---------------------------------

      Additionally, the economic instability in Mexico and other countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as adversely affect our access to, and cost of, capital.
 ﻿
 We are dependent upon large customers for current and future revenues. The loss of any of these customers, or the loss of market share by these customers, could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Our customers are major vehicle manufacturers. During 2017, our largest volume customers, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, Volkswagen Group, Nissan, Volvo, and Toyota accounted for 35%, 20%, 11%, 10%, 7%, and 5% of our revenues, respectively. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of our large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows by reducing cash flows and limiting our ability to spread our fixed costs over a larger revenue base. A variety of reasons could lead to a reduction of sales to our customers, including, but not limited to:
 ﻿

· | loss of awarded business;
--+--------------------------

  ﻿

· | reduced or delayed customer requirements;
--+------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | OEMs’ choosing to insource business that has been traditionally outsourced to us;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | strikes or other work stoppages affecting customer production; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | reduced demand for our customers’ products.
--+--------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 ﻿

Foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause a decline in our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 We generate a significant portion of our revenues and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have an adverse effect on our reported sales and profits, while depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and profits. 
 ﻿
 We may use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against certain foreign currency exchange rate risks (see Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to our swaps). Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations. The gains or losses associated with hedging activities may adversely affect our results of operations.
 ﻿
 The Trump Administration could make substantial changes to regulatory, fiscal, trade, and other policies that could adversely affect our business.    The Trump Administration has called for substantial changes to regulatory, fiscal and other policies, which may include significant changes to trade agreements currently in effect. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business. However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business. It is likely that some policies adopted by the administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Until we know what new changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by such changes.
 ﻿
 Deterioration in the United States and world economies could adversely affect our customers’ and suppliers’ ability to access the capital markets, which may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 The capital and credit markets provide companies with liquidity to help operate and grow their businesses, beyond that which is provided by operating cash flows. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our customers by making it increasingly difficult for them to obtain financing for their businesses and for their customers to obtain financing for automobile purchases. Our OEM customers typically require significant financing for their respective businesses. In addition, our OEM customers typically have related finance companies that provide financing to their dealers and customers. These finance companies have historically been active participants in the securitization markets, which experienced severe disruptions during the global economic crisis. Our suppliers, as well as the other suppliers to our customers, may face similar difficulties in obtaining financing for their businesses. If capital is not available to our customers or suppliers, or if the cost of capital is prohibitively high, their businesses would be adversely affected, which could result in their restructuring or even reorganization or liquidation under applicable bankruptcy laws. Any such adverse effect on our customers or suppliers could materially and adversely affect our Company, either through loss of revenues from any of our customers so affected, or due to our inability to meet our commitments without excess expense, as a result of disruptions in supply caused by the suppliers so affected.
 ﻿
 Financial difficulties experienced by any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on us if such customer were unable to pay for the products we provide or if we experienced a loss of, or material reduction in, business from such customer. As a result of such difficulties, we could experience lost revenues, significant write-offs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges, or additional restructurings beyond the steps we have taken to date.
 ﻿
 Any acquisitions or divestitures we make could disrupt our business and materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    We may, from time to time, consider certain acquisitions or divestitures. Acquisitions and divestitures involve numerous risks, including identifying attractive target acquisitions, undisclosed risks affecting the target, difficulties integrating acquired businesses, the assumption of unknown liabilities, potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with current customers and suppliers, the diversion of our management’s attention from other business concerns, and decreased geographic or customer diversification. 
 ﻿
 We cannot provide assurance that any acquisitions or divestitures will perform as planned or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow, or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we undertake. Any such failure could seriously harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 ﻿
 We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is underfunded and requires annual cash payments. If the performance of the assets in our pension plan does not meet our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our required contributions may be higher than we expect.
 We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is underfunded. While this plan is frozen as benefit accruals under the plan have ceased, the plan will require annual cash payments in order to meet our funding obligations, which adversely affects our cash flow. 
 ﻿
 Additionally, our earnings may be affected by the amount of income or expense recorded for our pension plan. GAAP requires that income or expense of a pension plan be calculated at the annual measurement date using actuarial assumptions, the most significant of 

 
15


 
which relate to the capital markets, interest rates, and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change these assumptions. These assumptions, along with the actual value of assets at the measurement date, will impact the calculation of pension expense for the year. Although GAAP expense and pension contributions are not directly related, the key economic indicators that affect GAAP expense also affect the amount of cash that we would contribute to our pension plan. The investment portfolio of the pension plan has experienced volatility. Because the values of these pension plan assets have fluctuated, and will fluctuate in response to changing market conditions, the amount of gains or losses that will be recognized in subsequent periods, the impact on the funded status of the pension plan, and the future minimum required contributions, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 ﻿
 The decreasing number of automotive parts suppliers and pricing pressures from our automotive customers could make it more difficult for us to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry.
 The automotive parts industry is highly competitive and bankruptcies and consolidation among automotive parts suppliers are reducing the number of competitors and resulting in larger competitors who benefit from purchasing and distribution economies of scale. Our inability to compete with these larger suppliers in the future could result in a reduction of, or inability to increase, revenues, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 ﻿
 Although the overall number of competitors is decreasing due to ongoing industry consolidation, we face significant competition within each of our major product areas. The principal competitive factors include quality, global presence, service, cost, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, and timely delivery. We also face significant competitive pricing pressures from our automotive customers. Because of their purchasing size, our automotive customers can influence market participants to compete on price terms. If we are not able to offset pricing reductions resulting from these pressures by improving operating efficiencies and reducing expenditures, those pricing reductions may have a material adverse effect on our business.
 ﻿
 We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry or that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business.
 ﻿
 The volatility of steel prices may adversely affect our results of operations.
 We utilize steel and various purchased steel products in virtually all of our products. We refer to the “net steel impact” as the combination of the change in steel prices that are reflected in the price of our products, the change in the cost to procure steel from mills, and the change in our recovery of scrap steel (which we refer to as “offal”). Our strategy is to be economically neutral to steel pricing by having these factors offset each other. While we strive to achieve a neutral net steel impact, we are not always successful in achieving that goal, in large part due to timing differences. The timing of a change in the price for steel may occur in separate periods and if a change occurs, that change may have a disproportionate effect on our liquidity because of the time difference between our payment for steel and our collection of cash from customers. We tend to pay for replacement materials, which are more expensive when steel prices are rising, over a much shorter period. As a result, rising steel prices may cause us to draw greater than anticipated amounts from our credit lines to cover the cash flow cycle from our steel purchases to cash collection for related accounts receivable. This cash requirement for working capital is higher in periods when we are increasing our inventory quantities.
 ﻿
 A by-product of our production process is the generation of offal. We typically sell offal in secondary markets, which are similar to the steel markets. We generally share our recoveries from sales of offal with our customers either through scrap sharing agreements, in cases in which we are participating in resale programs, or through product pricing, in cases in which we purchase steel directly from steel mills. In either situation, we may be affected by the fluctuation in scrap steel prices, either positively or negatively, in relation to our various customer agreements. As offal prices generally increase and decrease as steel prices increase and decrease, our sale of offal may mitigate the impact of the volatility of steel price increases, as well as limit the benefits reaped from steel price declines. Any volatility in offal and steel prices could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 ﻿
 We have a material amount of goodwill, which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net income and equity.    Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. GAAP requires that goodwill be periodically evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the reporting unit. As of December 31, 2017, we had $63.7 million of goodwill that could be subject to impairment. Declines in our profitability or the value of comparable companies may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of goodwill and a reduction of net income.
 ﻿
 Disruptions in the automotive supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 Automotive industry conditions could adversely affect the original equipment supply base. The automotive supply chain is subject to disruptions because we, along with our customers and suppliers, attempt to maintain low inventory levels. 
 ﻿


 
16


 
Disruptions could result from a multitude of potential problems, such as the closure of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions, or political upheaval. Disruptions could also result from logistical complications due to weather, earthquakes, or other natural or nuclear disasters, mechanical failures, technology disruptions, or delayed customs processing.
 ﻿
 If we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us. Any disruptions affecting us or caused by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 ﻿
 The inability for us, our customers, or our suppliers to obtain and maintain sufficient credit insurance or capital financing, including working capital lines, may adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of us, our customers, and our suppliers.    Our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending, in part, on the level, variability and timing of our customers’ vehicle production and the payment terms we have with our customers and suppliers. Our liquidity could also be adversely affected if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or payment on delivery. If our available cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we would be required to look to our cash balances and borrowing availability under our credit facilities to satisfy those needs, as well as look to potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts, if at all.
 ﻿
 There can be no assurance that we, our customers, or our suppliers will continue to have the ability to maintain sufficient capital financing. This may increase the risk of not being able to produce our products or having to pay higher prices for our inputs that may not be recovered in our selling prices. Our suppliers often seek to obtain credit insurance based on our consolidated financial condition and strength, which may be less robust. If we were to experience liquidity issues, our suppliers may not be able to obtain credit insurance and, in turn, would likely not be able to offer us payment terms that we have historically received, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.
 ﻿
 We may incur costs of a material nature related to plant closings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 If we must close manufacturing locations because of lost business or consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the employee termination costs, asset retirements, and other exit costs associated with the closure of these facilities may be significant. In certain circumstances, we may close a manufacturing facility that is operated under a lease agreement and we may continue to incur material costs in accordance with the lease agreement. We attempt to align production capacity with demand; however, we cannot provide assurance that plants will not have to be closed. 
 ﻿
 We are subject to environmental risks and requirements and we may incur significant costs, liabilities, and obligations associated with those risks and requirements.
 We are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws, regulations, and permits that govern, among other things, soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal, and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of materials, including GHGs, into the environment; and health and safety. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or become subject to litigation. Environmental and pollution control laws, regulations, and permits, and the enforcement thereof, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time, and may necessitate substantial capital expenditures or operating costs.
 ﻿
 Under certain environmental requirements, we could be responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our, or the Predecessor Company’s, currently or formerly owned or operated properties or third-party waste-disposal sites, even if we were not at fault. Soil and groundwater contamination is being addressed at certain of these locations. In addition to potentially significant investigation and cleanup costs, contamination can give rise to third-party claims for fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury, or property damage.
 ﻿
 We cannot provide assurance that our costs, liabilities, and obligations relating to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
 ﻿
 A disruption in our information technology systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our financial performance.
 ﻿
 We rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology systems. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our systems could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, natural or man-made incidents or disasters or unauthorized physical or electronic access. A breach could result in business disruption, theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information and unauthorized access to personnel information. To the extent that our 

 
17


 
business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could materially and adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.
 ﻿
 Risk Factors Relating to Our Indebtedness
 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial health and our ability to fund our operations, obtain financing in the future, and react to changes in our business.
 As of December 31, 2017, our total debt, including capital lease obligations and net of debt issue costs, was $386.8 million. That indebtedness could:
 ﻿

· | adversely affect our stock price;
--+----------------------------------

  ﻿

· | make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our financing arrangements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings have, and will continue to have, variable interest rates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to financial and restrictive covenants included in our debt agreements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | increase our cost of borrowing.
--+--------------------------------

  ﻿
 Our primary debt instrument is the Term Loan Credit Facility which bears interest at (i) the Alternate Base Rate plus a margin of 1.75% or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (calculated by multiplying the applicable LIBOR by a statutory reserve rate, with a floor of 1.00%) plus a margin of 2.75%. As of December 31, 2017, the balance on the term loan was $356.5 million (net of a $2.3 million discount). If the LIBOR rates increase in excess of 1%, we will incur higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. While we periodically enter into agreements designed to limit our exposure to higher interest rates, any such agreements do not offer complete protection from this risk.
 ﻿
 We may not be able to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
 We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance, extend the maturity of, or otherwise amend the terms of our existing indebtedness, or that any refinancing, extension, or amendment will be on commercially reasonable terms. The indebtedness issued in any refinancing of our existing indebtedness could have a significantly higher rate of interest and greater costs than our existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the financial terms or covenants of any new credit facility or other indebtedness issued to refinance our existing indebtedness will be the same or as favorable as those under our existing indebtedness.
 ﻿
 Our ability to complete a refinancing of our existing indebtedness prior to their respective maturities is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control. For example, if a disruption in the financial markets were to occur at the time that we intended to refinance this indebtedness, we might be restricted in our ability to access the financial markets. Also, if we were unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as:
 ﻿

· | sales of assets;
--+-----------------

  ﻿

· | sales of equity; or
--+--------------------

  ﻿

· | negotiations with lenders and their respective agents to restructure the applicable debt.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our debt instruments may restrict, and market or business conditions may limit, our ability to employ some of our options.
 ﻿


 
18


 
In addition, under our credit agreements, a change in control may lead the lenders to exercise remedies such as acceleration of the loan, termination of their obligations to fund additional advances and collection against the collateral securing such loan.
 ﻿
 We may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness, which may not be successful.
 Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, certain of which have short-term maturities, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, as well as financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay or refinance our indebtedness.
 ﻿
 Our debt instruments restrict our current and future operations.
 The financing agreements governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:
 ﻿

• | incur or guarantee additional debt, incur liens, or issue certain equity;

  ﻿
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | • | declare or make distributions to our stockholders, repurchase equity, or prepay certain debt;

  ﻿
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+-----------------------------------
 | • | make loans or certain investments;

  ﻿
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+-----------------------------------------------
 | • | make certain acquisitions of equity or assets;

  ﻿
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+-------------------------------------------------
 | • | enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

  ﻿
 ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------
 | • | enter into mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations;

  ﻿
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------
 | • | consolidate, transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of certain assets;

  ﻿
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+-------------------------------------------------
 | • | use the proceeds from sales of assets and stock;

  ﻿
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+--------------------------------------------
 | • | enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

  ﻿
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+-----------------------------------
 | • | enter into restrictive agreements;

  ﻿
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+---------------------------
 | • | make capital expenditures;

  ﻿
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------
 | • | change our fiscal year;

  ﻿
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+----------------------------------------------
 | • | amend or modify organizational documents; and

  ﻿
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------
 | • | engage in businesses other than the businesses we currently conduct.

  ﻿
 In addition to the restrictions and covenants listed above, certain of our financing documents require us, under certain circumstances, to comply with specified financial maintenance covenants. Any of these restrictions or covenants could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet certain capital needs and could otherwise restrict our corporate activities.
 ﻿
 Substantially all of our subsidiaries’ assets are pledged as collateral under our secured financing arrangements.
 As of December 31, 2017, we had $386.8 million (net of $8.2 million debt issue costs) of secured debt. Substantially all of our subsidiaries’ assets are pledged as collateral for our borrowings under our secured financing arrangements. Most of our domestic subsidiaries are either primary obligors or guarantors under a secured financing arrangement. Substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries’ assets are pledged as collateral for these obligations. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, the agent or the lenders, as applicable, would have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to secure the indebtedness and may sell the assets pledged as collateral in order to repay those borrowings, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

      Broad market fluctuations may result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock and you may not be able to sell your shares at prices you deem acceptable. In the past, following periods of volatility in the equity markets, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against public companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management attention.

 Shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing well.
 Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 350,000,000 shares of common stock and as of February 21, 2018 we had 20,542,397 shares of common stock outstanding.
