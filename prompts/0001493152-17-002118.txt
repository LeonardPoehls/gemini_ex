Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We were originally incorporated in October 1995 as a California corporation. In September 2000, we were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation and in December 2002, we merged with, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of, Acacia Research Corporation, or Acacia. In August 2007, we split off from Acacia and became publicly traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market. As a result of the split off, we ceased to be a subsidiary of, or affiliated with Acacia.
 
We are a family health-focused clinical molecular diagnostic laboratory specializing in pre-implantation genetic screening, prenatal diagnosis, miscarriage analysis, and pediatric developmental disorders. We strive to provide best-in-class clinical laboratory support to healthcare professionals, allowing them to maximize the clinical utility of their patients’ test results and to optimize patient care. Our testing focuses on advanced technologies, including single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, chromosomal microarray analysis, next-generation sequencing, fluorescent in situ hybridization, or FISH, and high resolution chromosome analysis (also referred to as karyotyping). Our approach to testing is to offer sophisticated technology along with high quality clinical support to our ordering physicians and their patients. Our laboratory facilities and corporate headquarters are located in Irvine, California.

Market Overview
 
We believe the molecular diagnostics market is one of the fastest-growing segments within the overall diagnostics market. Molecular diagnostics, within the context of this report, refers to the use of an individual’s genetic analysis to guide medical decision-making in the area of disease diagnosis and post-diagnostic management. Innovative approaches to re-sequencing of the human genome and a growing clinical appreciation and acceptance of the utility of genomic information in guiding clinical care have enabled the rapid growth of this market. We believe that the use of molecular diagnostics will continue to grow in the coming years and will have a significant impact on the way in which medicine is practiced.
Genes and Proteins
 
The human body is composed of billions of cells, each containing DNA that encodes the basic instructions for cellular function. The complete set of an individual’s DNA is called the genome, and is organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes, which are further divided into smaller regions called genes. Each gene is comprised of a specific sequence involving four nucleotides (also called bases): adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). These bases are complementary to one another in that A binds only with T and G binds only with C. This interaction forms base pairs, and is responsible for the double helix structure of DNA.
 
The human genome has approximately three billion nucleotides. The order of these nucleotides is known as the DNA sequence. When a gene is turned on, or expressed, the genetic information encoded in the DNA is transcribed (or copied) to an intermediate form, called messenger RNA, or mRNA. The mRNA code is then translated into a specific protein product. Proteins direct most cellular functions, some of which lead to the expression of individual traits, such as eye color or height. Some level of normal variability is seen throughout the genome; however, abnormal variations in the sequence of a gene or a region of the genome, such as deletions, duplications, or point mutations, can interfere with the normal physiology of the cells in which that gene is expressed. These abnormal variations may lead to disease, a predisposition to a disease, or an atypical response to certain types of drugs.
 
Genes and Molecular Diagnostics
 
There are a number of methods of genetic analysis that are used in diagnostic genetic testing. These methods broadly fall into three main categories: (i) sequencing of individual base pairs of DNA; (ii) assessing DNA copy number variation; and (iii) analyzing gene expression. In some diagnostic situations, it is only necessary to analyze either a single gene or a small number of genes. This diagnostic testing can be accomplished by a number of different techniques, depending on the situation. However, when a larger number of genetic factors need to be analyzed, one of the most efficient methods of analysis is to use a CMA, also referred to as microarray, which has the ability to measure millions of DNA variations in a single experiment.
Microarray Testing for DNA Copy Number Variation
 
Microarray testing assesses genome-wide copy number variation by comparing a patient’s genomic DNA to a reference genome to evaluate for relative losses and gains. Some losses and gains of genomic information are known to cause genetic disorders or predispose a person to a genetic disorder. Other gains and losses are considered benign because they occur in regions of the genome that are known to show variability in the normal population and have not been associated with any disease or disease process. Microarray testing is a powerful tool because it allows for simultaneous analysis of copy number variation across the entire genome at a high resolution in a single assay, providing a comprehensive analysis of all 46 chromosomes in a single test. Unlike gene expression arrays, which evaluate mRNA levels to monitor the activity of specific genes, DNA-based microarray analysis identifies quantitative defects in the number of copies of distinct segments of genomic DNA in order to test for conditions that are known to be associated with gains and losses of chromosomal information. Throughout this report, the terms microarray and array are used interchangeably, but always refer to DNA-based microarray testing.

Our Solutions for Molecular Diagnostics and Microarray Testing
 
In our laboratory facilities, we use the Illumina Infinium CytoSNP-850K BeadChip genome-wide array for our prenatal diagnostics and postnatal developmental disorders markets. Illumina’s CytoSNP-850K microarray is comprised of 50 nucleotide base, or 50-mer, probes attached to individual silica beads, which self-assemble into microwells on the array’s surface. Each single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP, probe is represented with a high degree of redundancy to improve sensitivity by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. To test a patient’s genomic DNA, it is first fragmented and then amplified. These fragments are allowed to hybridize with the complementary DNA on the 50-mer probes, and after hybridization, each fragment is extended by a fluorescently-labeled nucleotide (i.e., an A, T, C, or G). The fluorescent signal is subsequently amplified and detected by a scanner, which measures the intensity of each signal and the specific nucleotide detected for each SNP. This information is then compared to a control cluster, which is generated from pooling over 100 normal genomes tested using the same assay and is then evaluated for differences in copy number (i.e., deletions and duplications), as well as for genotypic information (i.e., homozygosity versus heterozygosity). For our miscarriage analysis testing, we utilize Illumina’s HumanCytoSNP-12 BeadChip array. These two microarray platforms are similar in many respects. However, as miscarriage analysis is performed primarily to identify the incorrect number of chromosomes (or “aneuploidy”), the slightly lower-resolution CytoSNP-12 microarray provides a more cost-effective solution.
Next Generation Sequencing for DNA Copy Number Variation
 
For the IVF testing market, we utilize next generation sequencing, or NGS, technology by Illumina’s VeriSeq™ preimplantation genetic screening, or PGS, assay to evaluate biopsied embryonic cells for whole chromosome and large segmental aneuploidies. DNA from one or more embryonic biopsied cells is amplified and then simultaneously fragmented and tagged with unique adapter sequences. Next, the samples undergo additional limited amplification, which utilizes the adapter sequences. This process also adds index sequences which is used to pool up to 24 samples in a single library for the sequencing process. The sequence data is de-multiplexed utilizing the index sequence information, aligned to the Human Genome Reference, and the copy number variances of these sequences are visualized using third-party analysis software.
Diagnostics Market Segmentation
 
In general, our diagnostic services and test menu are focused around our highly specialized genomic microarray and NGS technologies. While there are risks associated with billing and reimbursement of these highly specialized tests, we believe that our market position and test portfolio provide significant leverage in the rapidly growing personalized genomics/diagnostics space. Our test menu is further supplemented by what may be considered more routine tests, which allow us access to a broader, yet synergistic market. Our overall clinical market can be divided into four primary markets: (i) IVF testing, (ii) miscarriage analysis (also referred to as products of conception analysis or POC), (iii) prenatal diagnostic testing; and (iv) postnatal developmental disorder testing. Our research indicates that the global market for prenatal and newborn genetic testing is estimated to be valued at $8.4 billion by 2019. In addition, our market analysis indicates that our potential client base for these markets can be divided into multiple general customer groups, as detailed below. Our services are therefore tailored to meet the specific needs of each of these customer groups.
In Vitro Fertilization, or IVF, Diagnostic Testing
 

● | This market segment consists of approximately 480 IVF clinics nationwide. Testing is focused on screening embryos for aneuploidy and is primarily referred to as PGS. A significant proportion of embryos created through IVF will have an abnormal chromosomal complement, and this percentage dramatically increases with age. The goal of PGS is to determine the chromosomal make-up of each embryo to help the IVF specialist identify the most suitable embryo(s) for transfer. Based on our market research, the majority of IVF clinics in the United States do not have an in-house laboratory capable of performing this high complexity testing, and therefore must send embryo biopsy samples out to reference laboratories. Commercial laboratories providing PGS utilize a variety of technology platforms, including: real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), SNP microarray, and next-generation sequencing (NGS). We believe this market segment is rapidly growing due to the impact of delayed childbearing, as well as the negative impact of increased obesity on fertility. As most insurers currently do not provide coverage benefits for PGS, our business model requires billing the patient up-front for our services, typically by credit card, or billing the fertility clinic providing the IVF services, both of which eliminate third-party reimbursement risks. We estimate that the current total U.S. market for diagnostic testing in this segment to be approximately $125 million per year.

Miscarriage Analysis
 

● | Community-based hospital pathology laboratories and regional reference laboratories: This segment of the market is characterized by hospitals that provide basic laboratory services but do not offer complex genetic testing, such as SNP microarrays. Generally speaking, in the past decade, most community hospitals have relied on traditional methods of chromosomal analysis, such as karyotyping or FISH for miscarriage testing, which is typically sent out to a specialty laboratory. However, based on more recent, highly compelling data demonstrating the superiority of microarray testing to karyotyping, we believe significant growth opportunities exist in this segment. This segment of the market is characterized by a preponderance of clients that require us to bill the patients’ insurers directly, as opposed to engaging in an institutional, direct-bill relationship. We estimate the current total U.S. market for diagnostic testing in this segment to be approximately $300 million per year.

● | Physician groups: In the developmental genetics market, physician groups collectively constitute a significant market opportunity. This segment of the market typically outsources all of their genetic testing services, meaning they require a global level of service that necessitates processing all aspects of patient billing. The physicians that make up this market include reproductive endocrinologists, OB-GYNs and maternal fetal medicine specialists, or MFMs. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | IVF Clinics: In this market, miscarriage analysis is performed for patients who experience a successful implantation of the embryo, but end up being unable to sustain the pregnancy. 

Prenatal Diagnostic Testing
 

● | Physician groups: Prenatal diagnostic testing is performed on samples retrieved from specific diagnostic procedures performed during pregnancy. This testing can also be used as a confirmatory diagnostic analysis following maternal serum screening or non-invasive prenatal testing, or NIPT, or as a standalone diagnostic assay. There are two primary diagnostic procedures utilized to obtain a fetal sample: (i) chorionic villus sampling, in which a small sample of the placenta is biopsied; or (ii) amniocentesis, in which a small amount of amniotic fluid is collected. These procedures are performed by MFM specialists and some OB-GYNs. Typically, these physicians order testing directly from our laboratory. This market continues to be important as diagnostic testing during pregnancy is critical to ongoing maternal clinical care. We estimate that the current total U.S. market for diagnostic testing in this segment to be approximately $100 million per year.

Postnatal Diagnostic Testing
 

● | Pediatric geneticists, pediatric neurology clinics and Children’s Hospitals: This market segment, particularly the Children’s Hospital sector, generally has relatively comprehensive laboratory capabilities and performs most basic genetic and chromosomal testing in-house, such as chromosome analysis, FISH and PCR-based tests. These facilities typically provide comprehensive genetic counseling to their patients, which is a key component in the clinical evaluation and utilization of complex genomic assays in the pediatric diagnostic arena. Due to economic conditions, some institutions find themselves in the untenable situation of having limited access to third-party manufactured kit components and being unable to internalize such highly specialized genomic testing platforms due to lack of expertise in this area. This segment of the market typically outsources the testing completely. From a billing perspective, many of the customers in this segment prefer the direct billing model, and individual test pricing is negotiated with each institution. We estimate that the current total U.S. market for diagnostic testing in this segment to be approximately $200 million per year.

Technologies
 
Our objective is to provide a suite of molecular diagnostic tests utilizing the following technologies:
 
SNP Microarrays
 
The Illumina microarray that we utilize was designed by a consortium of academic and commercial laboratories (including CombiMatrix), using content recommendations from the International Collaboration for Clinical Cytogenomics and the Sanger Institute. The resulting assay is a dense, high-resolution, whole-genome array that covers 3,262 dosage-sensitive genes that are known to be associated with genetic disorders and/or syndromes. Probe coverage is highly focused in regions of known clinical significance, with additional probes to provide coverage for the remainder of the genome, or the “genomic backbone”. In addition to copy number evaluation, SNP probes provide genotypic information that can indicate imprinting disorders, regions of homozygosity that may contain a disease-causing gene, shared ancestry (which can lead to an increased risk for an autosomal recessive disorder in a child), and in the case of prenatal and miscarriage analysis, identification of partial and complete molar pregnancies and maternal cell contamination.
 
Meta-analyses and large prospective studies have demonstrated that microarray testing provides a significant increase in the detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities compared to standard cytogenetic testing (i.e., karyotyping and evaluation of the tips of chromosomes, called subtelomeres, by FISH). Although the percent increase varies based on the type of sample being tested (i.e., miscarriage tissue, pediatric sample, prenatal sample), the data has shown that standard chromosomal analysis misses many disorders that are easily identifiable by microarray testing. The ability to identify a specific cause for a disorder or the cause of a pregnancy loss assists not only with diagnostic management, but also with anticipatory care.

SNP Microarray Analysis on FFPE Tissue
 
Although fresh tissue from a miscarriage is ideal, in some cases, it is not available. In these situations, the tissue has typically been processed by a pathology laboratory using formalin to fix the tissue and embedding it in a paraffin block for storage (referred to as formalin fixed paraffin embedded or FFPE sample). One of the major benefits of using a microarray to evaluate the fetal chromosomes instead of karyotyping is that microarrays are DNA-based, meaning they can analyze DNA from tissue whether or not it is still living, unlike karyotyping which requires fresh, living tissue. To be a comprehensive service provider, it is critical that our microarray platform be able to evaluate genomic alterations not just in fresh miscarriage tissue, but also tissue from FFPE samples. Traditionally, working with FFPE samples has proven challenging because the fixation and storing process degrades the quality of the DNA. We believe we have successfully adapted our array protocol for the optimal analysis of FFPE specimens by using a specialized process, in which the fragmented DNA is restored to longer segments by ligating free DNA ends together prior to analysis. This restoration step makes the array particularly useful in analyzing DNA samples that are of poorer quality, such as older samples or tissue that has been strongly fixed in formalin. We believe this process developed by our laboratory has allowed us to successfully analyze this challenging sample type, which is not amenable to testing by other platforms.
 
Next Generation Sequencing for IVF Testing
 
The Illumina VeriSeq PGS kit has been stringently validated by clinical laboratories world-wide for the past four years. While aCGH technology (specifically, Illumina’s 24sure microarray) was considered to be an acceptable platform for PGS testing in years past, NGS technology has since been repeatedly demonstrated to be at least as good, if not better than, aCGH in terms of sensitivity and specificity. VeriSeq PGS offers the added advantage of increased sensitivity for the presence of mosaic abnormalities (i.e. when more than one cell line is present). This is in large part due to the BlueFuse Multi Analysis software that we use, which is part of the VeriSeq PGS kit. With BlueFuse, the data processing algorithm has been optimized to create a smoother plot and a much larger dynamic range, making it easier to separate true abnormalities from noise. Not only is VeriSeq PGS able to accurately identify whole chromosome aneuploidies, it is also able to detect segmental aneuploidies of 20 Mb or greater. Segmental aneuploidies of this size are considered detrimental to embryo survival and targeted assays that are not capable of identifying segmental aneuploidies have been associated with worse outcomes compared to whole-genome assays such as VeriSeq PGS. These outcomes included: decreased implantation rates, increased miscarriage rates, and decreased ongoing pregnancy rates.
Our Services
 
Overview
 
We utilize the latest technologies to deliver molecular diagnostic services primarily in the area of reproductive health for the diagnosis of developmental disorders associated with intellectual disability, congenital anomalies, dysmorphic features, and autism spectrum disorders. Such disorders may be diagnosed in the prenatal period, the pediatric period, or as one of the factors leading to a miscarriage or stillbirth.
Miscarriage, Intrauterine Fetal Death and Stillbirth Analysis
 
As with prenatal and pediatric genetics, karyotyping has long been considered the standard of care for evaluating pregnancy losses for chromosomal disorders. However, tissue from miscarriages, fetal deaths and stillbirths is difficult to culture (grow) in the laboratory, and this culturing process is required in order to perform a karyotype. Microarray analysis is particularly useful in this arena, as it does not depend on the successful growth of a cell culture. Instead, it relies solely on the sample’s DNA, which can be directly extracted from nearly any fetal tissue sample. While karyotyping fails to provide a result in between 20-40% of these cases, microarray testing is able to provide a result greater than 90% of the time. This is particularly beneficial in the analysis of first trimester pregnancy loss, as it is estimated that 50-60% of all first trimester losses are due to chromosomal abnormalities. Being able to identify the cause of the miscarriage in one out of every two women means that physicians are better able to provide personalized reproductive counseling and plan future pregnancy management for a much larger segment of their patient population.
IVF: Preimplantation Genetic Screening
 
In IVF testing, PGS was traditionally performed at cleavage stage (Day 3) embryos by biopsying one or two cells of the early stage embryos for testing. In recent years, there has been a marked shift toward biopsying multiple cells from the trophectoderm of blastocyst (Day 5) embryos after it was demonstrated that Day 3 biopsies were much more harmful to the embryo than Day 5 biopsies. PGS is most often utilized when there is a history of reproductive failure, recurrent pregnancy loss, a previous aneuploid pregnancy, family history of aneuploidy, or advanced maternal age. We believe that approximately 25% of IVF cycles in the United States involve the use of PGS. Throughout the years, a number of different technologies have been employed, including FISH, quantitative PCR, array CGH, SNP microarray, and NGS. At present, it is not clear which of these technologies will prove optimal for routine clinical use. There are a number of studies indicating that NGS may have the greatest accuracy and the most sensitivity with respect to the detection of mosaicism; however, the clinical relevance of this information remains to be determined.

Developmental Disorders: Prenatal and Pediatric Care
 
The focus of our prenatal and postnatal microarray is to assist in diagnosing genomic syndromes associated with intellectual disability, developmental delays, congenital anomalies, dysmorphic features and autism spectrum disorders.
 
Prenatal: In 2013, following the publication of a large, prospective, multicenter trial designed to compare karyotyping to microarray analysis in the prenatal population (Wapner et al.), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, which is the governing body for the practice of medicine in the area of obstetrics and gynecology, recommended that microarray analysis be performed in lieu of standard karyotyping when fetal anomalies are present on ultrasound, and any time there is a fetal death or stillbirth. The ACOG also recommended that microarray analysis be offered as an alternative to standard karyotyping for any patient undergoing a prenatal diagnostic procedure, given the increased sensitivity of microarray analysis to detect chromosomal abnormalities, even following a normal karyotype result.
 
CMA provides critical information for families and their physicians. In prenatal care, it allows the physician and patient to make better pregnancy management and care decisions, as well as allowing for the opportunity to provide anticipatory care with respect to abnormalities that may be associated with a specific disorder that may not yet be recognizable. Such knowledge can inform decisions about where to deliver (such as at a tertiary care center for an infant with complex abnormalities) and how aggressive to be with neonatal support in very severe cases. In pediatric care, the same is true. Once the cause of a child’s development disorder and/or congenital anomalies has been identified, parents, teachers and physicians can work toward ensuring that appropriate medical and educational care decisions are made based on the child’s condition. As with prenatal care, microarray analysis can assist in providing appropriate anticipatory care, such as initiating screening tests at an earlier age when the child’s disorder is associated with an increased risk of a specific disorder or disease complication.
 
Postnatal: In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics, or AAP, released a clinical report in which it proclaimed microarray analysis as a first tier test for children with intellectual disability or global developmental delays. Prior to that, in 2010, the American College of Medical Genetics, or ACMG, which is the governing body for the utilization of genetic testing, recommended microarray testing in lieu of standard karyotyping children with intellectual disabilities, developmental disorders, congenital abnormalities, dysmorphic features, and autism/autism spectrum disorders based on the fact that microarray analysis doubled the detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities in these patients.
 
The Evolution of Our Clinical Microarray Testing
 
In 2006, we introduced our first developmental disorders microarray, which detected over 50 different genetic disorders in one multiplexed analysis. In October 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, indicated that this test did not require approval under its guidance as it did not meet the definition of an In Vitro Diagnostics Multivariate Index Analysis, or IVDMIA. Following this determination, we launched our microarray test under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, guidelines for use in the clinical care of patients. Since then, we have launched several upgrades of this test. Our current microarray offering is capable of identifying more than 500 recurrent syndromic and non-syndromic genetic disorders, ranging from common conditions, such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and DiGeorge syndrome (deletion 22q11.2), and many more rare disorders.
 
We actively monitor peer-reviewed publications for relevant information that allows us to analyze and modify our test reporting processes as necessary so as to include the most up-to-date clinical information for the benifit of our patients. We anticipate that these continuous improvement processess may result in either incremental improvement to our current array design, or significant changes for a new version of our arrays in the future. As an example of our publication-driven approach, as early as 2009, we began to include specific coverage of regions shown to be strongly associated with autism spectrum disorders, or ASDs, or predisposition to ASDs, long before the guidelines to testing children with autism/ASDs included microarray analysis. It is now recognized that approximately 7% of all children with an ASD have a genomic abnormality that is identifiable by microarray. This contributes to the clinical recommendation that chromosomal microarray analysis be offered to all individuals with an ASD as part of a first-tier diagnostic evaluation. Implementation and use of this high density whole-genome array provides valuable and clinically actionable information for over 10% of all pediatric patients evaluated for neurodevelopmental disorders. Significantly, recent studies from our group and others have enabled us to have a clearer appreciation of the extent and nature of structural variation in the human genome in health and disease. Additionally, the ability to identify recurrent and rare structural imbalances by microarray analysis is now allowing us to decipher potential mechanisms that result in complex chromosomal rearrangements with adverse phenotypic impact. Therefore, we believe that not only are we solving challenging diagnostic dilemmas for patients and their families, but also providing valuable long-term care and prognostic information.

More significantly, based upon an ongoing evaluation of current medical literature and critical evaluation of multiple microarray platforms available for clinical use, we adopted a microarray platform that analyzes SNPs across the genome at an extremely high resolution. In addition to assessing genomic copy number variations, analysis of SNPs enables detection of regions of heterozygosity involving single or multiple chromosomes, which may provide clues towards identifying possible genetic imprinting disorders and / or situations that increases the risk of autosomal recessive disorders due to shared ancestry. In the miscarriage analysis space, in addition to allowing identification of a whole spectrum of whole-chromosome and segmental genomic imbalances, SNPs readily enable detection of triploidy, molar pregnancies, and maternal cell contamination, thereby decreasing the number of additional ancillary testing often required for such samples.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our strategic intent is to become the preeminent diagnostic services laboratory for reproductive healthcare testing using the best technologies available. In our efforts to achieve this objective, we leverage our direct sales team to market our IVF testing, prenatal diagnostic testing, postnatal testing, and miscarriage analysis testing. In addition, we have established pathology partnerships and strategic alliances with industry partners to increase our commercial distribution footprint.
Direct Sales Efforts
 
Our sales and marketing representatives aggressively market our PGS, miscarriage analysis and prenatal diagnostic microarray testing to four primary physician groups: OB/GYNs, MFMs, reproductive endocrinologists in IVF clinics and the historically underserved Pathology community. It is primarily the OB/GYN and occasionally the MFM, who perform the surgical procedure to remove fetal and placental tissue from the uterus following a miscarriage or fetal death. Pathologists are the custodians of this tissue and are often charged with determining which reference lab to utilize for send-out testing on these specimens. Embryologists in the IVF clinics conduct the biopsies of embryos in the clinic. MFMs conduct the CVS and amnio procedures, often in clinic as well. For the miscarriage analysis market, our strategic sales approach is to engage with, and sell to, the multiple decision-makers in the laboratory and the clinic, culminating with the pathologist. We believe this pathology-centric approach to miscarriage analysis testing, where we leverage our expertise in the testing of FFPE, gives us a competitive edge. Whereas our competitors’ primary sales call points are the medical office clinicians, and their primary test offerings focus on other product or service lines in developmental testing, we are very focused on the miscarriage analysis market and the unmet clinical need for this testing.
 
In December 2012, two studies by the National Institute of Health, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrated the diagnostic superiority of microarray analysis compared to traditional karyotyping for both stillbirths (Reddy, et al.) and prenatal diagnosis for ongoing pregnancies (Wapner, et al.). As mentioned above, in December 2013, ACOG issued a Committee Opinion not only recommending microarray analysis in lieu of karyotyping for fetal death and stillbirths (also referred to as POCs), but also as a superior test modality for prenatal diagnosis. In June 2016, our medical team and several thought leaders published the largest study of its kind regarding microarray analysis on POCs, Genetics in Medicine. In this study of 8,118 samples analyzed over a period of 44 moths, we found an overall success rate of 91.0% for all sample types including both fresh tissue (92.4%) and FFPE (86.4%). In addition to the detection of whole chromosome aneuploidies, we identified polyploidy, whole genome homozygosity (seen in molar pregnancies), segmental genomic imbalances, and cases affected by maternal cell contamination. Given the increased diagnostic power and significantly higher success rate for obtaining results compared to karyotyping, our data supported microarray analysis as the preferred testing modality for pregnancy losses of all gestational ages. We are leveraging our direct sales channel and our strategic partners’ channels to capitalize on the prenatal diagnostic testing opportunity and the recommendations of ACOG, which we believe highlight the superiority of microarray testing compared to traditional testing, such as karyotyping and FISH.
 
Strategic Alliances
 
Strategic alliances with established industry partners allow us to round-out our test menu to offer complete testing solutions to MFM specialists, reproductive endocrinologists, and OB/GYNs, and to capitalize on the demand for complementary test options, such as NIPT, which remains a screening modality. We have established several key partnerships in the past and we will continue to consider accretive business relationships that add value to our customers.
 
In addition, we have focused our reimbursement efforts on maximizing collections for all of the tests that we perform. We internalized our billing and collections process in 2012 and continue to augment our billing and reimbursement department to secure future positive coverage decisions and optimize payer relations. In 2016, we observed that several third-party insurance plans altered their coverage decisions and determined that testing products of conception for recurrent pregnancy loss by microarray is indeed clinically valuable and medically necessary. We believe this change from non-coverage to coverage for products of conception testing by microarray is a positive trend. We are also focused on increasing our managed care relationships, and have previously announced payor contracts covering our suite of diagnostics services, and expect to execute additional payor contracts in the future.
 
Scientific Advisory Board
 
In 2015 we initiated efforts to build our scientific advisory board (SAB), which as of the date of this filing currently is comprised of six members. We believe that our SAB adds significant intellectual and business expertise to CombiMatrix and to the direction of our current and future test offerings. Our SAB currently includes leaders in the areas of maternal fetal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, reproductive endocrinology, clinical embryology and pediatric neurology.

Billing and Reimbursement
 
Payor Categories
 
Revenues from our clinical laboratory tests are generated primarily from the provision of test results to the referring healthcare provider. Reimbursement, however, can come from several different sources. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, parties that reimburse us for our services include direct-bill customers, third-party payors and individual patients. Where there is a coverage policy, contract or agreement in place, we bill the third-party payor, the hospital or referring laboratory as well as the patient (for deductibles and coinsurance or copayments, where applicable) in accordance with the policy or contractual terms. Where there is no coverage policy, contract or agreement in place, we pursue reimbursement on behalf of each patient on a case-by-case basis and rely on applicable billing standards to guide our claims process.
 
Our direct-bill payors include healthcare institutions such as hospitals, clinics, physician offices and in some circumstances, patients themselves. For the direct-bill and individual patient categories, our diagnostic services are billed and revenues are recognized at established contractual rates, once the test results have been delivered to the ordering physician.
 
Third-party payors include organizations such as commercial insurance companies, as well as government payors including Medicare and Medicaid. We bill our tests to these payors using individual billing codes known as Common Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes established for array-based laboratory diagnostic testing. For the non-governmental third-party payor category, our diagnostic services are billed at our list prices for the test(s) performed, but they are recognized for accounting and financial reporting purposes as diagnostic service revenues based upon the amounts expected to be collected. The difference between the amount billed to each payor and the amount expected to be collected is recorded as a contractual allowance. For governmental payors, we recognize revenues based upon published fee schedules established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, or various state Medicaid fee schedules.
 
CPT Coding
 
CPT codes are the main data code set used by physicians, hospitals, laboratories and other health care professionals to report separately-payable clinical laboratory tests for reimbursement purposes. The CPT coding system is maintained and updated on an annual basis by the American Medical Association, or AMA. In 2012, the AMA added over one hundred new CPT codes for specific molecular tests such as ours. These new codes replaced the more general “stacking” codes that were previously used to bill for these services, and they became effective January 2013. In the Final Physician Fee Schedule Rule, which was issued in November 2012, CMS stated that it had determined it would pay for the new codes as clinical laboratory tests, which are payable on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS. Although the various Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, established pricing based on a “gap filling” methodology, not all of the codes were priced by CMS, and were omitted from the 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 CLFS. Among these were molecular codes we use in billing for our microarray testing.
 
The omission of certain CPT codes utilized by us from the CLFS could have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash reimbursement going forward. We continue to work with industry advisory groups to determine what information and action is needed to ensure continued reimbursement. There is a possibility that other third-party payors will establish negative or inadequate coverage policies or reimbursement rates.
 
Reimbursement
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 21% and 27% of our diagnostic services revenues were derived from direct bill customers, 71% and 68% from third-party commercial insurance carriers, 2% and 3% from government payors, including Medicare and several state Medicaid plans, and 6% and 2% from private pay customers, respectively.
 
With respect to the third-party payors that we bill, we are considered an “out-of-network” provider with the majority of the carriers, resulting in varying expected reimbursement amounts, which we believe is not unusual for a company such as ours that offers highly specialized and/or unique testing. An “in-network” provider has a contracted arrangement with the insurance company or benefits provider. This contract governs, among other things, service-level agreements and reimbursement rates. In certain instances, an insurance company may negotiate an “in-network” rate for our testing rather than pay the typical “out-of-network” rate. During our operating history, we have been able to receive reimbursement for most of our tests from major commercial third-party payors based on their established policies. Our efforts in obtaining reimbursement are based on individual claims, include pursuing appeals or reconsiderations of claim denials, require a substantial amount of time and effort, and may still result in bills not being paid for many months, if at all. Furthermore, if a third-party payor denies coverage after final appeal, payment may not be received. We have implemented a revenue cycle management system and have expanded our billing and collections department to address these issues. We have also executed managed care contracts to become “in-network” with certain third-party payors, and continue to seek additional “in-network” contracts. However, we cannot predict whether, or under what circumstances, payors will reimburse our microarray tests. Payment amounts can also vary across individual policies. Denial of coverage by payors, or reimbursement at inadequate levels, will have a material adverse impact on market acceptance of our tests.

Governmental Regulation
 
Our business is subject to extensive laws and regulations as described below. It is impossible to predict what future changes will be made to federal, state and local laws and regulations and the impact that such changes may have on us.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
 
Comprehensive health care reform legislation passed in 2010 entitled The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, instituted permanent cuts to the CLFS, which are in addition to the automatic sequestration reductions mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011. However, due to new government leadership under President Donald Trump, executive orders designed to scale back the impact of the ACA have recently been enacted in 2017. Also, the U.S. Congress, in alliance with President Trump, is likely to propose sweeping legislation during 2017 to repeal and replace the ACA. We believe that a newly revised ACA will likely contain a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations, albeit in ways we cannot currently predict. Provisions governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, and the treatment of fraud and abuse will still impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. Generally, the ACA and private payers may soon be faced with new legislation designed to contain costs or legislate different financial options for consumers who purchase health care insurance. These reforms present challenges and unpredictability to laboratories like ours.
 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA
 
As a clinical reference laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses as well as certain certifications and permits to conduct our business. Under CLIA, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of work we perform and to comply with standards covering personnel, facilities administration, quality systems and proficiency testing. We have a certificate of accreditation under CLIA to perform testing and are accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP. To renew our CLIA certificate, we are subject to periodic inspection standards applicable to the testing we perform. Should regulatory compliance requirements become substantially more complex, operational costs at our lab might increase in the future. If our laboratory is out of compliance with CLIA requirements, we may be subject to certain sanctions including suspension or revocation of our CLIA certificate and various civil and/or criminal penalties. We must maintain CLIA compliance and certification to be eligible to bill for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. If we were to be found out of compliance with CLIA program requirements and subjected to sanctions, our business could be harmed. We are not able to guarantee that we will pass all future license and/or certification inspections.
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA
 
Regulations by the FDA regarding genetic testing are in a state of flux and changes to these regulations could dramatically affect the molecular diagnostics industry in the near future. While the FDA has the authority to regulate laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, it has generally exercised enforcement discretion in the area of LDTs performed by CLIA-certified laboratories. However, with the advent of Direct-to-Consumer DNA testing (i.e., testing that is marketed directly to the public, does not require a physician’s order, and provides risk factor information rather than diagnostic or prognostic information), genomic testing using microarray technology (particularly single nucleotide polymorphism arrays) has come under scrutiny. In July 2010, the FDA held a two-day public meeting to obtain input from key stakeholders, including physicians, laboratory directors, regulatory and accrediting body members and the general public, regarding the structuring of a regulatory framework for LDTs. During this meeting, we believe that it became clear that the FDA’s primary concern had less to do with CLIA-certified laboratories (such as ours) performing clinical microarray testing (i.e., testing ordered by a physician for medically necessary reasons, including disease diagnosis, monitoring and treatment decisions) and more to do with Direct-to-Consumer laboratories performing non-clinical testing that relies on what the FDA has referred to as “black box” proprietary algorithms to interpret their microarray data. This meeting came on the heels of a U.S. Government Accountability Office report entitled “Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Tests: Misleading Test Results are Further Complicated By Deceptive Marketing and Other Questionable Practices.”
 
On October 3, 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents regarding proposals for the regulation of LDTs in the Federal Register. The 120-day public comment period on the draft documents began at issuance and lasted until February 2, 2015. Since this time, industry stakeholders have responded to the FDA draft guidance document, both for and against, with the only certainty being that a change in how LDTs will be monitored and by what federal agency are on the horizon. In early January of 2017, the FDA announced it would not issue a final guidance on the oversight of LDTs at the request of various stakeholders, such as the AMA and the ACOG in order to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach and to give Congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a longer-term, legislative solution. There can be no assurance that changes to the FDA’s involvement in LDTs will not negatively impact our business. Generally speaking, the FDA and the legislative branch frequently entertain proposals that would increase FDA oversight of laboratories like ours and the testing that we conduct. The outcome and impact of such proposals on our business is impossible to predict. The FDA may impose a range of penalties for non-compliance with any of its rules, including recalls, injunctions and sanctions, any of which would negatively impact our business.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA
 
Under HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued regulations to protect the privacy of individuals’ personal medical and health information through the implementation of security measures that govern how such data is stored and maintained, and to limit the disclosure of this “protected health information” to only those who receive specific authorization from the individual. The federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, enacted in February 2009, expanded the HIPAA rules significantly, in particular HIPAA enforcement. For example, HITECH authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions on behalf of state residents and it requires HHS to conduct extensive auditing. Perhaps most importantly, HITECH renders HIPAA directly applicable to the “business associates” of covered entities, which in some cases may mean us. The omnibus regulation implementing most of the HITECH provisions was published in January 2013. In February 2014, CMS issued final rules amending HIPAA to provide individuals or their personal representatives with the right to receive copies of their test reports from laboratories covered by HIPAA and/or to request that such test reports be transmitted to certain third parties. This rule preempts many state laws that prohibit laboratories like ours from directly providing individuals with their test reports. Violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties, including up to ten years imprisonment. Consequently, our policies and procedures are designed to comply with such regulations. The requirements under these regulations may change periodically and we will continue to monitor such changes.
 
There are also a number of state laws governing confidentiality of health information that are applicable to our operations, and new laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future. Violation of such laws could affect our applicable state licensure and could also result in criminal and/or civil penalties.
 
In addition, HIPAA and many state laws would require that we provide a written notification to affected individuals, certain federal and state agencies, and possibly the media if we suffered a breach of personal medical or health information. While we believe that we comply with regulations currently, we can provide no assurance that we are or will remain in compliance with diverse privacy requirements as they develop.
 
We believe that we are in compliance with the current Transactions and Code Sets Rule. We have transitioned from use of ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM as of October 1, 2015. Experience to date with use of ICD-10-CM shows no negative effects on our receipts and net revenue. We also believe that we are in compliance with the Operating Rules for electronic funds transfers and remittance advice transactions. We will continue to assess our computer systems to ensure compliance with such requirements.
 
Federal and State Insurance Regulations, Self-referral Prohibitions and Anti-kickback Laws
 
We are subject to federal and state laws, such as the Federal False Claims Act, state false claims acts, the illegal remuneration provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal anti-kickback laws, state anti-kickback laws, and the federal “Stark” laws, that govern financial and other arrangements among healthcare providers, their owners, vendors and referral sources, and that are intended to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse. Among other things, these laws prohibit kickbacks, bribes and rebates, as well as other direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements that are designed to induce the referral of patients to a particular provider for medical products or services payable by any federal healthcare program, and prohibit presenting a false or misleading claim for payment under a federal or state program. They also prohibit some physician self-referrals. These laws are liberally interpreted and aggressively enforced by multiple state and federal agencies and law enforcement (including individual “qui tam” plaintiffs) and such enforcement is increasing. For example, the ACA increased funding for federal enforcement actions and many states have established their own Medicare/Medicaid Fraud Units and require providers to conspicuously post the applicable Unit’s hotline number. Possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of eligibility to participate in federal and state reimbursement programs and civil and criminal penalties. Changes in these laws at all levels of government are frequent and could increase our cost of doing business. If we fail to comply, even inadvertently, with any of these requirements, we could be required to alter our operations, refund payments to the government, lose our licensure or accreditation, enter into corporate integrity, deferred prosecution or similar agreements with state or federal government agencies, and become subject to significant civil and criminal penalties.
State Laboratory Licensing
 
In addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under CLIA, licensure is required and maintained for our clinical reference laboratory under California law. We currently maintain a license in good standing with the California Department of Health Services, or DHS, but if our clinical reference laboratory is found to be out of compliance with California standards, our license may be suspended or revoked by the California DHS, and we may be subject to fines and penalties.

We must also satisfy various applications and provisional requirements for other states in which we desire to conduct business, and we have obtained licenses for Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. We are licensed by the New York State Department of Health to perform prenatal and postnatal/pediatric cytogenetic testing, microarray analysis for pediatric care, prenatal, and miscarriage analysis, and our PGS test offering has conditional approval enabling us to offer PGS testing in the state of New York. We may become aware from time to time of additional states that require out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure in order to accept patient specimens from those states, and it is possible that other states do have such requirements or will have such requirements in the future. If we identify any other state with such requirements or if we are contacted by any other states advising us of such requirements, we intend to strictly adhere to the instructions and guidelines from the state regulators as to how we should comply with such requirements. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts to comply will be successful.
 
Commercial Operations
 
All services offered by us are performed in our CLIA certified, CAP accredited clinical laboratory in Irvine, California. Our commercial operations infrastructure includes sales, marketing, clinical support services and billing/reimbursement. We continue to build a nationally focused commercialization strategy by interacting directly with pathologists, medical geneticists, maternal fetal medicine specialists, reproductive endocrinologists, obstetrician and gynecologists, pediatric neurologists and genetic counselors. The market-specific experience of our direct sales force, coupled with regional and local territory experience, is expected to increase physician awareness and demand for our services. Our marketing and clinical support services teams work in tandem to increase awareness and appropriate utilization of our services by both physicians and patients. Our marketing initiatives include traditional marketing tactics such as physician education, professional medical society and advocacy tradeshows as well as web based initiatives. Our billing and reimbursement team works to facilitate access to our services by assisting ordering physicians and their patients with healthcare insurance billing, appeal processes, patient payment options, and securing managed care contracts with willing payers. In addition to our direct sales approach, we actively market our services to other laboratories through pathology partnerships and through strategic alliances with complementary industry partners.
Seasonality
 
Our business is subject to the impact of seasonality, particularly during the mid-summer months when patients tend to be less likely to visit their healthcare providers for diagnostic testing due to vacations, and in the latter part of December and early January when many IVF clinics close down for annual maintenance. In addition, during the winter months, disruptions in transportation due to inclement weather may affect not only patients’ ability to visit their healthcare providers, but it may also prompt provider concerns about potential disruption or delay in sample processing, both of which negatively impact our business. Consequently, the demand for our services, in general, could be subject to declines in the summer and during periods of severe weather.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
As a part of our corporate restructuring that occurred in 2010, many of our issued patents and patent applications were licensed to a private company, CustomArray, Inc., for which we receive minimum royalties of $100,000 per year. The intellectual property rights that remain are not currently used in our molecular diagnostics services business.


We seek to protect our corporate identity and services with trademarks and service marks. In addition, our trademark strategy includes protecting the identity and goodwill associated with our technologies and services. Currently, our registered trademarks include COMBIMATRIX®.
 
We attempt to obtain licenses to the patent rights of others when required to meet our business objectives. For example, we purchase chemical reagents from suppliers who are licensed under appropriate patent rights. Further, our policy is to obtain licenses from patent holders for our services whenever such licenses are required. We evaluate if and when a license is needed or required depending upon the individual circumstance.
 
Competition
 
We believe that competition within our market is increasing. Our business competitors in the United States include regional clinical microarray laboratories, both commercial and academic, as well as large national companies such as LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics, Natera, Progenity, the Cooper Companies, and several others. Some of these competitors may possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. In addition, technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors could render our services obsolete or uneconomical. The existing approaches of competitors or new approaches or technology developed by competitors may be more effective than those developed by or currently utilized by us.

Our market is rapidly changing, and we expect to face additional competition from new market entrants, new product and service developments and consolidation of our existing competitors. As new competitors emerge, the intensity of competition may increase in the future. An example of this is the emergence of NIPT companies in the past several years. These companies offer a screening test based on the analysis of cell-free fetal DNA in the maternal blood stream as opposed to the analysis of pregnancy-related hormones and proteins, as has been the standard of care for several decades. Despite improvements to detection rates, NIPT remains a screening test, and as such, clinical guidelines recommend that all positive NIPT results be confirmed with diagnostic testing performed using an invasive technique, such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development activities primarily relate to the development and validation of diagnostic tests in connection with our specialized PGS, miscarriage analysis, prenatal and pediatric developmental disorder genetic tests. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred research and development expenses of $493,000 and $466,000, respectively.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 55 full-time-equivalent employees, one of whom is an M.D. and another of whom is a Ph.D. We believe that we maintain good relationships with our employees and are not subject to collective bargaining arrangements.
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations involve the use, transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous substances. As a result, we are subject to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. The cost of complying with these and any future environmental regulations could be substantial, though historically such costs have not been significant. In addition, if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, or release any hazardous substances into the environment, we could be exposed to substantial liability in the form of fines, penalties, remediation costs and other damages and could even suffer a curtailment or shut down of our operations.
