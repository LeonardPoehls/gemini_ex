GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS 
 Description of the Company 
 On December 14, 2016, we announced the unveiling of our new name, PGT Innovations, Inc. (PGTI), formerly PGT, Inc. The name change is part of our strategy to bring together under a single identity our three, go-to-market brands serving all levels of the premium impact-resistant window and door market, from mass-custom to high-end, luxury products which we believe are the most cutting-edge, technologically advanced window and door products in the industry. We pioneered the U.S. impact-resistant window and door industry. By bringing together our three brands, PGT® Custom Windows & Doors, CGI®, and WinDoor®, under the umbrella of the PGT Innovations, Inc. name, we believe solidifies our position as the leading manufacturer and supplier of residential impact-resistant windows and doors in the U.S. 
 Our PGT impact-resistant products, which are marketed under the WinGuard® brand name, combine heavy-duty aluminum or vinyl frames with laminated glass to provide protection from hurricane-force winds and wind-borne debris by maintaining their structural integrity and substantially reducing the likelihood of penetration by impacting objects. Impact-resistant windows and doors satisfy stringent building codes in hurricane-prone coastal states and provide an attractive alternative to shutters and other active forms of hurricane protection that require installation and removal before and after each storm. Combining the impact resistance of WinGuard, with our insulating glass creates energy efficient windows that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs. We also manufacture non-impact resistant products in both aluminum and vinyl frames. Our current market share in Florida which is the largest U.S. impact-resistant window and door market, is greater than that of any of our competitors. 
 On September 22, 2014, we completed the acquisition of CGI Windows and Doors Holdings, Inc. (CGI) which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Industries, Inc. CGI was established in 1992 and has consistently built a reputation based on designing and manufacturing quality impact-resistant products that meet or exceed the stringent Miami-Dade County impact standards. Today, CGI continues to lead as an innovator in product craftsmanship, strength and style, and we believe its brands are highly recognized and respected by the architectural community. CGI product lines include the Estate Collection, Sentinel by CGI, Estate Entrances, Commercial Series and Targa by CGI. On July 25, 2016, the Company created CGI Commercial, Inc. (CGIC), a Florida corporation. CGIC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGI. CGIC was created for the purpose of acquiring the operations of US Impact Systems, Inc. (USI), a Florida corporation doing business primarily in the Miami area of Florida. USI is an established fabricator of storefront window and door products. CGIC, under the CGI brand, is the entity we use to market and sell our commercial storefront system products. 
 On February 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of WinDoor, Incorporated (WinDoor), a provider of high-performance, impact-resistant windows and doors for five-star resorts, luxury high-rise condominiums, hotels and custom residential homes. WinDoor is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Industries, Inc. At its manufacturing and administrative facilities in Orlando, Florida, WinDoor manufactures high-end, high-quality aluminum and thermally-broken aluminum products, featuring sliding glass doors, terrace doors, and windows. 
 At our manufacturing facilities in North Venice, Orlando, and Miami, Florida, where collectively we have over 2,600 employees, we produce fully-customized windows and doors for the luxury, premium and mass-custom markets, and have glass insulating, tempering and laminating facilities, which provide us with a consistent source of impact-resistant laminated and insulated glass, shorter lead times, and lower costs relative to third-party sourcing. 
 The geographic regions in which we currently conduct business include the Southeastern U.S., Gulf Coast, Coastal mid-Atlantic, the Caribbean, Central America, and Canada. We distribute our products through multiple channels, including approximately 1,300 window distributors, building supply distributors, window replacement dealers and enclosure contractors. This broad distribution network provides us with the flexibility to meet demand as it shifts between the residential new construction and repair and remodeling end markets. 
 History 
 Our subsidiary, PGT Industries, Inc., a Florida Corporation, was founded in 1980 as Vinyl Tech, Inc. The PGT brand was established in 1987, and we introduced our WinGuard branded product line in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. CGI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Industries, Inc. on September 22, 2014. WinDoor became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Industries, Inc. on February 16, 2016. CGIC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGI on August 31, 2016.

PGT Innovations, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed on December 16, 2003, and on June 27, 2006, we became a publicly listed company on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol PGTI. Prior to changing its name to PGT Innovations, Inc., which was announced on December 14, 2016, the Company was named PGT, Inc. Effective on December 28, 2016, the listing of the Companys common stock was transferred to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) from the NASDAQ. On that date, the Companys common stock began trading on the NYSE under its existing ticker symbol of PGTI.

PGT Custom Windows & Doors 
 WinGuard. WinGuard is an impact-resistant product line that combines heavy-duty aluminum or vinyl frames with laminated glass to provide protection from hurricane-force winds and wind-borne debris and satisfies increasingly stringent building codes. Our marketing and sales of the WinGuard product line is primarily targeted at hurricane-prone coastal states in the U.S., as well as the Caribbean and Central America. Combining the impact resistance of WinGuard with our insulating glass creates energy efficient windows that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs. In the first quarter of 2015, we announced the launch of our new WinGuard Vinyl line of windows and doors, our all-new impact-resistant vinyl window designed to offer some of the highest design pressures available on impact-resistant windows and doors, in an attractive modern profile, with larger sizes capable of handling the toughest hurricane codes in the country. It also protects against flying debris, intruders, outside noise and UV rays, making it a top choice for customers seeking an impact-resistant window. 
 EnergyVue. EnergyVue is our non-impact vinyl window featuring energy-efficient insulating glass and multi-chambered frames that meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones to help consumers save on energy costs. The new design has a refined modern profile combined with robust construction to make larger sizes and higher design pressures an unparalleled offering. We rounded out the line with one of the industrys most extensive selection of frame colors and a variety of hardware finishes, glass tints, grid styles and patterns for our customers. We announced the launch of EnergyVue in the first quarter of 2015. 
 Aluminum. We offer a complete line of fully customizable, non-impact-resistant aluminum frame windows and doors. These products primarily target regions with warmer climates, where aluminum is often preferred due to its ability to withstand higher structural loads. Adding our insulating glass creates energy-efficient windows that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs. 
 Eze-Breeze. Eze-Breeze non-glass vertical and horizontal sliding panels for porch enclosures are vinyl-glazed, aluminum-framed products used for enclosing screened-in porches that provide protection from inclement weather. This line was completed with the addition of a cabana door. 
 CGI 
 Estate Collection. Our Estate Collection of windows and doors is CGIs premium, high-end aluminum impact-resistant product line. These windows and doors can be found in elegant homes, prestigious resorts, hotels, schools and office buildings. Our Estate Collection combines best-in-class performance against hurricane force damage with architectural-grade quality,

 handcrafted details and superior engineering. Similar to WinGuard, Estate windows and doors protect and insulate against many external events, from hurricanes to UV protection, outside noise and forced entry. Estates aluminum frames are much thicker than many of our competitors frames, making it an excellent choice for any coastal area prone to hurricanes. 
 Sentinel. Sentinel is a complete line of aluminum impact-resistant windows and doors from CGI that provides exceptional quality, craftsmanship, energy efficiency and durability at an affordable price. Sentinel windows and doors are manufactured to enhance the aesthetics of the home while delivering protection from the most extreme coastal conditions. Sentinel is custom manufactured to exact sizes within our wide range of design parameters, therefore, reducing on-site construction costs. In addition, Sentinels frame depth is designed for both new construction and replacement applications resulting in faster, less intrusive installations. 
 Targa. Targa is CGIs line of vinyl energy-efficient, impact-resistant windows designed specifically to exceed the Florida impact codes, the most stringent impact standards in the U.S. Targa windows enhance the aesthetics of a home and are low maintenance windows with long-term durability, and environmental compatibility. 
 Commercial Storefront System. Our Commercial Storefront window system and entry doors are engineered to provide a flexible yet economical solution for a variety of applications. Our system provides easy fabrication and assembly, while also reducing installation time and challenges. 
 WinDoor 
 Aluminum Doors and Windows. WinDoor produces a wide array of high-end, luxury aluminum doors and windows, including impact and non-impact sliding glass doors and terrace doors, fixed picture windows, single hung windows, and horizontal rolling windows. All of WinDoors aluminum windows are available in impact and non-impact versions, and are made from heavy-duty, robust materials and meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones to help consumers save on energy costs. 
 Thermally Broken Doors and Windows. WinDoor produces a variety of aluminum thermally broken doors and windows. WinDoors thermally broken products provide the strength of aluminum with the energy ratings usually only seen in vinyl products. All of WinDoors thermally broken products are available in multiple shapes and sizes while earning high performance ratings on high impact and non-impact certifications, and meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones to help consumers save on energy costs.

Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales strategy primarily focuses on attracting and retaining distributors and dealers with an expectation of consistently providing exceptional customer service, leading product designs and quality, and competitive pricing all using our advanced knowledge of building code requirements and technical expertise. 
 Our marketing strategy is designed to reinforce the high quality of our products and focuses on both coastal and inland markets. We support our markets through print and web-based advertising, consumer, dealer, and builder promotions, and selling and collateral materials. We also work with our dealers and distributors to educate architects, building officials, consumers and homebuilders on the advantages of using impact-resistant and energy-efficient products. We market our products based on our expectations of quality, building code compliance, outstanding service, shorter lead times, and on-time delivery using our fleet of trucks and trailers. 
 Our Customers 
 We have a highly diversified base of approximately 1,300 window distributors, building supply distributors, window replacement dealers and enclosure contractors. Our largest customer accounts for approximately 3% of net sales and our top ten customers account for approximately 20% of net sales. Our sales are comprised of residential new construction and home repair and remodeling end markets, which represented approximately 42% and 58% of our sales, respectively, during 2016. This compares to 41% and 59%, respectively, in 2015. 
 We do not supply our products directly to homebuilders, but believe demand for our products is also a function of our strong relationships with a number of national homebuilders.

Materials and Supplier Relationships 
 Our primary manufacturing materials include aluminum and vinyl extrusions, glass, ionoplast, and polyvinyl butyral. Although in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. While most of our materials are typically available from other sources, we would not be able to quickly transition to alternative sources on short-notice in many instances, due, for example, to the length of time it would take us to complete testing and certifications related to impact-resistance and for the alternative source of supply to create the customized equipment and tooling necessary to provide the materials and components to us. Aluminum and vinyl extrusions accounted for approximately 38% of our material purchases during fiscal year 2016. Sheet glass, which is sourced from two major national suppliers, accounted for approximately 13% of our material purchases during fiscal year 2016. Sheet glass that we purchase comes in various sizes, tints, and thermal properties. From the sheet glass purchased, we produce most of our own laminated glass needs. However, in 2016 and 2015 due to some temporary capacity constraints, we purchased some of our laminated glass needs from one major national supplier. This finished laminated glass made up approximately 17% of our material purchases in fiscal year 2016. Polyvinyl butyral and ionoplast, which are both used as inner layer in laminated glass, accounted for approximately 11% of our material purchases during fiscal year 2016. 
Backlog 
 As of December 31, 2016, our backlog was $40.6 million. As of January 2, 2016, our backlog was $31.6 million. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers that have not yet shipped, and we expect that substantially all of our current backlog will be recognized as sales in the first quarter of 2017, due in part to our lead times which range from one to five weeks. 
Intellectual Property 
 We own and have registered trademarks in the United States. In addition, we own several patents and patent applications concerning various aspects of window assembly and related processes. We are not aware of any circumstances that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to use our trademarks and patents. As long as we continue to renew our trademarks when necessary, the trademark protection provided by them is perpetual. 
Manufacturing 
 Our manufacturing facilities are located in Florida where we produce customized products. The manufacturing process typically begins in our glass plant where we cut, temper, laminate, and insulate sheet glass to meet specific requirements of our customers orders. 
 Glass is transported to our window and door assembly lines in a make-to-order sequence where it is combined with an aluminum or vinyl frame. These frames are also fabricated to order. We start with a piece of extruded material which is cut and shaped into a frame that fits the customers specifications. Once complete, product is immediately staged for delivery and generally shipped on our trucking fleet within 48 hours of completion. 
 Competition 
 The window and door industry is highly fragmented, and the competitive landscape is based on geographic scope. The competition falls into the following categories. 
 Local and Regional Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of numerous local job shops and small manufacturing facilities that tend to focus on selling products to local or regional dealers and wholesalers. Competitors in this group typically lack marketing support and the service levels and quality controls demanded by larger distributors, as well as the ability to offer a full complement of products. 
 National Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors tends to focus on selling branded products nationally to dealers and wholesalers and has multiple locations. 
 International Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of non-U.S. companies that have created entities and established manufacturing operations within Florida, and have an increasing presence in the South Florida region as suppliers of windows and doors, primarily for high-rise buildings. 
 
- 7 - 
 
Active Protection: This group of competitors consists of manufactures that produce shutters and plywood, both of which are used to actively protect openings. Our impact windows and doors represent passive protection, meaning, once installed, no activity is required to protect a home from storm related hazards. 
 The principal methods of competition in the window and door industry are the development of long-term relationships with window and door dealers and distributors, and the retention of customers by delivering a full range of high-quality products on time while offering competitive pricing and flexibility in transaction processing. Trade professionals such as contractors, homebuilders, architects and engineers also engage in direct interaction with manufacturers, and look to the manufacturer for training and education related to products and codes. Although some of our competitors may have greater geographic scope and access to greater resources and economies of scale than do we, we believe our leading position in the U.S. impact-resistant window and door market, and the award winning designs and high quality of our products, position us well to meet the needs of our customers. 
 Environmental Considerations 
 Although our business and facilities are subject to federal, state, and local environmental regulation, environmental regulation does not have a material impact on our operations, and we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations. 
Employees 
 As of the end of 2016, we employed approximately 2,600 people, none of whom were represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
