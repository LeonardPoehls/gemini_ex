Introduction

Belmond is a leading luxury hotel company and sophisticated adventure travel operator with exposure to both mature and emerging national economies. The Company’s predecessor began acquiring hotels in 1976 and organized the Company in 1994. Belmond currently owns, partially-owns and/or operates 45 properties (with two additional businesses scheduled for future openings, the Belmond Cadogan Hotel in London, England and the Belmond Andean Explorer train in Peru), consisting of 34 highly individual deluxe hotels, one stand-alone restaurant, seven tourist trains and three river/canal cruise businesses. This portfolio includes one long-term leased hotel in Bali, Indonesia where the owner dispossessed Belmond from operation of the hotel in November 2013 (see Item 3—Legal Proceedings). The locations of Belmond's 45 properties operating in 23 countries are shown in the map on the preceding page. Belmond acquires, leases or manages only distinctive properties in areas of outstanding cultural, historic or recreational interest in order to provide luxury lifestyle experiences for the discerning traveler. 
Revenue, earnings and identifiable assets of Belmond in 2016, 2015 and 2014 for Belmond's business segments and geographic areas are presented in Note 23 to the Financial Statements (Item 8). Belmond's operating segments are aggregated into six reportable segments, namely owned hotels in each of Europe, North America and Rest of World, owned trains and cruises, part-owned/managed hotels and part-owned/managed trains. 
Belmond revised the order of the presentation of these segments in the year ended December 31, 2016 and included a new sub-total to show management fees earned by the Company. In addition, Belmond reclassified certain expenses associated with the Company’s development team from the Part-owned/managed hotels segment to central costs. Prior periods have been re-presented to reflect the current period presentation. There has not been a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Hotels represent the largest part of Belmond’s business, contributing 87% of revenue in 2016, 87% of revenue in 2015 and 86% in 2014. Trains and cruises accounted for 13% of revenue in 2016, 13% of revenue in 2015 and 14% in 2014. Approximately 89% of Belmond’s customer revenue in 2016 was from leisure travelers, with approximately 47% originating from North America, 37% from Europe and the remaining 14% from elsewhere in the world.

Belmond’s worldwide portfolio of hotels currently in operation consists of 3,272 individual guest rooms and multiple-room suites, each known as a “key”. Hotels owned by Belmond in 2016 achieved an average daily room rate (“ADR”) of $490 (2015 - $481; 2014 - $523) and a revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) of $298 (2015 - $295; 2014 - $306).
In recent years, Belmond has sold to third parties a number of properties not considered key to Belmond’s portfolio of unique, high-valued properties. In March 2014, Belmond sold Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond on the eastern shore of Maryland, with Belmond continuing to manage the hotel under a ten-year management agreement (that permits termination on the fifth anniversary 
4

of the agreement) with the new owner. See Note 4 to the Financial Statements. In May 2015, Belmond, together with its joint venture partner, each sold their 50% ownership in the entity which owned the Hotel Ritz by Belmond in Madrid, Spain and Belmond ended its agreement to manage the hotel. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements.
On February 23, 2014, the Company (formerly known as Orient-Express Hotels Ltd.) announced that its board of directors had approved a proposal to operate the Company's portfolio of luxury hotels and travel experiences under a new brand name—"Belmond"—from March 10, 2014, and to change its principal Internet website address to belmond.com. Belmond has retained its long-term license agreement with SNCF, the French transportation company that owns the "Orient-Express" trademark, for the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train. With the decision to introduce the "Belmond" brand, Belmond also entered into an agreement with SNCF to terminate (with effect from December 31, 2014) the "Orient-Express" license for hotel use, without any cost or penalty. At the 2014 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders approved a change in Belmond's corporate name from Orient-Express Hotels Ltd. to Belmond Ltd. in order to align Belmond's corporate identity with that of its primary luxury brand. On July 28, 2014, Belmond changed the ticker symbol of its class A common shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange from OEH to BEL.
On March 21, 2014, Belmond entered into a $657,000,000 senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $552,000,000 seven-year term loan and a $105,000,000 five-year, dual-currency revolving credit facility. The term loan comprised a $345,000,000 U.S. dollar-denominated tranche and a €150,000,000 euro-denominated tranche ($207,000,000 as of the completion date). Belmond used the proceeds from the term loan to refinance substantially all of the funded debt of Belmond (other than the debt of Belmond Charleston Place, a consolidated variable interest entity with separate non-recourse financing). On June 2, 2015, Belmond entered into an amendment to its senior secured credit facility to reduce the interest rate on the euro-denominated tranche to EURIBOR plus a 3.00% margin from EURIBOR plus a 3.25% margin.
In August 2014, Charleston Center LLC entered into an $86,000,000 loan secured on its real and personal property. This loan had no amortization and is non-recourse to Belmond. This loan had an August 2019 maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.12% per annum. In June 2016, Charleston Center LLC refinanced this loan with a $112,000,000 new loan with the same August 2019 maturity. The interest rate on the new loan is LIBOR plus 2.35% per annum, has no amortization and is non-recourse to Belmond. The additional proceeds were used to repay a 1984 development loan from a municipal agency in the principal amount of $10,000,000 and accrued interest of $16,819,000. In connection with the early repayment of the loan, Belmond negotiated a discount that resulted in a net gain reported in the statements of consolidated operations of $1,200,000 upon the extinguishment of the debt, including the payment of a tax indemnity to our partners of $2,800,000 in respect of their allocation of income from the discount arising on the cancellation of indebtedness. See Note 10 to the Financial Statements.
On July 8, 2014, Belmond announced the execution of a management agreement with Cadogan Hotel Partners Limited to operate Belmond Cadogan Hotel, a 64-key hotel in the Knightsbridge area of London, England. The 127-year old hotel closed at the end of July 2014 to undergo a $48,000,000 investment project. The fully renovated and re-conceptualized Belmond Cadogan Hotel is expected to open in 2018 with refurbished public areas and the reconfiguration reduced to 54 keys in order to accommodate demand from luxury travelers for larger junior suites and suites.
On August 30, 2016, the Company commenced operations of Belmond Grand Hibernian, the first overnight luxury rail experience of its kind in Ireland. The luxury sleeper train accommodates up to 40 guests in 20 en-suite cabins. Belmond Grand Hibernian builds on the Company's expertise in operating a stable of the world's most famous trains, including Belmond Royal Scotsman, currently the U.K.'s only luxury touring sleeper train, and the legendary Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.

Belmond Hotel Rio Sagrado—23 keys including two villas—is owned by Belmond's Peru hotel joint venture and is located in the Sacred Valley of the Incas between Cusco and Machu Picchu. Opened in 2009, this rustic hotel has a spa with indoor plunge pool and extensive gardens beside the Urubamba River on a site of about six acres set against an imposing mountain backdrop.  The Sacred Valley is a popular part of holiday itineraries in Peru, and a station on Belmond’s PeruRail train service is a short distance from the hotel. During 2013, the joint venture refurbished the guest rooms, enlarged the spa and installed an outdoor heated swimming pool. In 2014, the property enhanced the main entry arrival with new entry drive and landscape improvements and added a train platform/lounge to accommodate Hiram Bingham train guests stopping at the hotel. In 2015, the joint venture acquired an adjacent parcel of land of approximately two and a half acres on which the joint venture is contemplating further development. 
Owned Trains and Cruises

Venice Simplon-Orient-Express comprises 18 historic railway cars, all of which have been refurbished in original 1920s/1930s décor and meet modern safety standards. It operates once or twice weekly principally between multiple cities and Venice from March to November each year via Paris, Zurich and Innsbruck on a scenic route through the Alps. The journey from London to Venice departs from London Victoria station on the Belmond British Pullman train; passengers then cross the English Channel by coach on the Eurotunnel shuttle train. Occasional trips are also made to Vienna, Prague, Berlin, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Budapest and Istanbul. During 2015, the bar was completely refurbished and as of early 2016, the train added air conditioning to its four public carriages and commenced a two-year project to add air-conditioning to all of its guest rooms. Venice-Simplon-Orient-Express is made up of three dining cars, one bar car and sleeper cars carrying up to 182 passengers in 85 double and 12 single cabins. Venice Simplon-Orient-Express is also available for charter by private groups.

Belmond British Pullman consists of 11 Pullman dining cars in Britain which operate all year originating out of London on short excursions to places of historic, scenic or sporting interest in southern England, including some weekend trips when passengers stay at local hotels. Full fine dining is offered on every departure. 

Belmond Northern Belle is a tourist train offering day trips and charter service principally in the north of England.  It builds on the success of Belmond’s British Pullman business, which focuses on the south of England around London. This train consists of 
10

seven owned dining cars elegantly decorated to be reminiscent of old British “Belle” trains of the 1930s, plus three kitchen and service cars, and can carry up to 276 passengers. Fine dining is served on board and passengers stay in local hotels on some weekend itineraries.

Belmond Royal Scotsman is a luxury sleeper train owned by Belmond and comprises nine Edwardian-style cars, including five sleeping cars (each compartment with private bathroom), two dining cars and a bar/observation car, and accommodates up to 36 passengers. Operating from April to October, the train travels on itineraries of up to seven nights through the Scottish countryside affording passengers the opportunity to visit clan castles, historic battlegrounds, famous Scotch whiskey distilleries and other points of interest. During 2016, an additional car was added to the train, which includes two spa treatment cabins and four additional berths which connect to accommodate families.
Belmond Grand Hibernian is a luxury sleeper train owned by Belmond and comprises ten Georgain-styled railway cars, including five sleeping cars (each compartment with a private bathroom), two dining cars, a bar/observation car and accommodates up to 40 passengers. It operates from April to October and travels on three itineraries through the Irish countryside affording passengers the opportunity to visit castles, lakes, towns, whiskey distilleries and other places of interest. This train commenced service in August 2016 through mid-October 2016 and will begin its 2017 season in April.
Belmond Road to Mandalay is a luxury river cruise ship on the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) River in central Myanmar.  The ship was a Rhine River cruiser built in 1964 that Belmond bought and refurbished. It has 43 air conditioned cabins with private bathrooms, spacious restaurant and lounge areas, and a canopied sun deck with swimming pool. The ship travels between Mandalay and Bagan up to eight times each month and carries up to 82 passengers who may enjoy sightseeing along the river and guided shore excursions to places of cultural interest. Three- to 11-night itineraries are offered. The ship does not operate in the summer months and occasionally when the water level of the river falls too low due to lack of rainfall. During 2015, the top deck barbeque and bar venues were refurbished.
Belmond Orcaella, Belmond's second river cruise ship in Myanmar, was built in Yangon to Belmond's luxury standards and launched in July 2013. The ship is named after the dolphins found in the inland waterways of the country, and accommodates up to 50 passengers in 25 spacious river-facing cabins, with restaurant, lounge and bar, and sundeck with plunge pool. It cruises between Yangon and the far north of Myanmar on the Ayeyarwady and Chindwin Rivers on seven- to 11-night itineraries to areas accessible to Belmond Orcaella because of its shallow draft and maneuverability. The ship is subject to a five-year charter that expires in 2018 and the Company holds an option to renew the charter for an additional five years.

Belmond Afloat in France is composed of five luxury river and canal boats (called péniche-hôtels) owned by Belmond and operating in Burgundy, Provence and other rural regions of France. They accommodate between four and 12 passengers each in double berth compartments with private bathrooms, and some have small plunge pools on deck. They operate seasonally between April and October on three- to six-night itineraries with guests dining on board or in nearby restaurants. Shore excursions are organized each day. It is anticipated that during 2017, two additional canal boats accommodating eight passengers each will be added to the fleet and will operate in the Champagne and Alsace regions of France. 
All Belmond trains and cruises are available for private charter.

Part-Owned/Managed Trains
PeruRail: Belmond and local Peruvian investors formed two 50%/50% owned companies (PeruRail S.A. and Ferrocarril Transandino S.A., together "PeruRail"), as a joint venture that was awarded in 1999 a 30-year franchise to operate the track and other infrastructure of the state-owned railways in southern and southeastern Peru and a license to operate passenger and freight services in those areas. The franchise may be extended every five years upon PeruRail's application and government approval, and currently expires in 2034 with four additional five-year extensions remaining. PeruRail pays the Peruvian government fees related to traffic levels and the use of rail infrastructure, locomotives and rolling stock. The 70-mile Cusco-Machu Picchu line, carrying mainly tourists as well as local passenger traffic, is the principal means of access to the famous Inca ruins at Machu Picchu because there is no convenient road. Another carrier operates on this line in competition with PeruRail. A second rail line runs from Cusco to Matarani on the Pacific Ocean (via Arequipa) and to Puno on Lake Titicaca, and principally serves freight traffic under contract, an activity PeruRail is expanding by hauling the output of local copper mines in southern Peru to the Pacific port for export. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Year on Year Comparisons—Year ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015 and year ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014—Part-Owned/Managed trains, 2015 compared to 2014". The Cusco-Machu Picchu line connects four of Belmond’s Peruvian hotels, allowing inclusive tours served by Belmond’s Hiram Bingham luxury daytime tourist train comprising two dining cars and a bar/observation car with capacity up to 84 passengers.  PeruRail also operates a daytime tourist train currently called the Andean Explorer on the Cusco-Puno route through the High Andes mountains and which is expected to move to the Cusco-Machu Picchu line under a new name. In 2017, a new sleeper train is expected to be launched under the name Andean Explorer and is expected to run through the Peruvian Highlands from Cusco to Lake Titicaca and Arequipa. This train consists of 21 carriages, which Belmond owned and operated in Australia until 2003 and sold to PeruRail in 2016. The train was shipped from Australia to Peru where it is undergoing a renovation of its interiors to a luxury standard offering modern comfort, as well as updates to the mechanical systems. This will be South America's first luxury sleeper train and will accommodate up to 48 passengers. 

Eastern & Oriental Express: During its operating season from September to April, the Eastern & Oriental Express offers a round trip each week between Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. The journey includes two or three nights on board and side trips to Kuala Kangsar in Malaysia and the River Kwai in Thailand. Some overnight trips are also made from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and elsewhere in Thailand and to Vientiane, Laos. Longer itineraries, up to six nights on board, are offered to places of historic, scenic and cultural interest in the region. Originally built in 1970, the 24 cars were substantially refurbished in an elegant Asian décor and fitted with modern facilities such as air conditioning and private bathrooms. The train is made up of sleeping cars, three restaurant cars, a bar car and an open air observation car and carries up to 82 passengers. The Eastern & Oriental Express is available for charter by private groups. Belmond manages the train and has a 25% shareholding in the owning company.
Management Strategies

As the foregoing indicates, Belmond has a global mix of luxury hotel and travel products that are geographically diverse and appeal to both high-end individual travelers as well as prominent meeting, incentive, and social groups. Individual travelers in 2016 made up approximately 72% of total hotel room nights, with meeting, social, and incentive groups accounting for the remaining 28%. Belmond’s properties are distinctive as well as luxurious and tend to attract guests prepared to pay higher rates for the travel experiences and high-quality service Belmond offers compared to its competitors.

Belmond benefits from long-term trends and developments favorably impacting the global hotel, travel and leisure markets, including growth trends in the luxury hotel market in many parts of the world, increased travel and leisure spending by consumers, favorable demographic trends in relevant age and income brackets of U.S., European and other populations, and increased online travel bookings. 

Belmond’s vision is to continue to be the consummate luxury experiential travel company, providing guests with a window into authentic, 'one-of-a-kind' experiences in some of the most unique destinations in the world. Belmond announced a strategic growth plan intended to grow its business by focusing on three key areas:


• | Driving top-line growth and bottom-line results at the Company's existing businesses -- Belmond plans to continue owning or part-owning and operating most of its existing properties, which allows Belmond to develop each product's distinctive local character and to benefit from current cash flow and potential future gains on sale. Belmond considers its combined owner/operator role as efficient and consistent with the long-term nature of its assets. Self-management or management with equity interest has enabled Belmond to capture the economic benefits otherwise shared with a third-party manager, to control the operations, quality and expansion of the hotels, and to use its experience with market adjustments, price changes, expansions and renovations to improve cash flow and enhance asset values. The Company

12

continues to emphasize increasing revenue and earnings at its established and recently opened properties, with a particular focus on:

◦ | maximizing RevPAR while controlling costs associated with incremental revenue;


◦ | upgrading core systems to drive greater demand, improve customer relationships and increase website conversion ratios;


◦ | investing in capital improvements at existing hotels and expanding where land or space is available, in both cases when potential investment returns are relatively high and operating costs are low;


◦ | putting a greater emphasis on margin improvements; and


◦ | increasing the utilization of its trains and cruises by adding departures and, for PeruRail, expanding its contracted freight business.


• | Continuing the Company's efforts to build brand awareness -- Many of Belmond’s individual properties, such as Belmond Hotel Cipriani, Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, Belmond Copacabana Palace, Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel and ‘21’ Club, have distinctive local character and strong brand identities. Prior to introducing the Belmond brand in 2014, the Company promoted its individual hotel properties and the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train through the “Orient-Express" sub-brand. In 2014, the Company elected to migrate to more of a "hard-brand" strategy and now markets its collection under the Belmond brand. At the same time, the Company retained its long-term license agreement with SNCF, the French transportation company that owns the "Orient-Express" trademark for the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train. With the decision to introduce the Belmond brand, the Company also entered into an agreement with SNCF to terminate (with effect from December 14, 2014) the "Orient-Express" license for hotel use, without any cost or penalty.

The revised brand and marketing strategy is intended to increase consumer recognition of the broad scope of the Company's unique collection of luxury hotels and travel experiences, thereby increasing repeat and multi-property visits and enhancing revenue growth, and to heighten awareness of the entire portfolio of individual properties among existing and potential new guests. Management also expects this approach will make Belmond more attractive to third-party owners thereby facilitating the strategy of expanding into third-party management of properties that complement Belmond's existing portfolio. 
The Company has made important progress on increasing consumer and industry awareness of the Belmond brand in the approximately three years since its launch. Management believes that there is additional scope for expanding awareness and is focused on building the brand and gaining more market share within the luxury leisure brand landscape. In particular, the Company is focused on making Belmond "the brand of choice" for its specific niche by expanding brand training for employees in order to bring the brand to life for guests while on property, identifying and introducing signature programming that differentiates the Company from its competitors, and utilizing public relations and media opportunities to introduce new experiences while at the same time reinforcing the Belmond brand.

• | Expanding the Company's global footprint -- As part of the strategic plan that the Company unveiled in 2016, Belmond identified global footprint expansion as a meaningful driver of the Company's long-term growth and value. Footprint expansion includes growing the Company's international portfolio through any or all of the following: acquisitions, long-term leases, management agreements -- with or without a related investment, franchise agreements, and construction or acquisition of new train or cruise businesses. Factors in Belmond's evaluation of a potential acquisition, lease, management or franchise opportunity include the property's fit within the Belmond brand and the Company's target geographic markets, as well as an assessment against certain Company's defined financial criteria, with a focus on maintaining conservative debt and leverage levels. In keeping with this conservative approach, the Company expects to partially finance larger acquisitions through the sale of select existing assets while at the same time seeking to retain long-term management of any disposed asset.


As a sizeable part of its footprint expansion strategy, the Company plans to pursue long-term contracts to manage distinctive luxury hotels owned by others principally on a fee basis. These contractual arrangements may include cash, loan or other investment, including key money, by Belmond in connection with renovating or converting a property to meet Belmond's standards and to align Belmond's interest as an operator with the owner. Management agreements are desirable to the Company in that they would typically be a less-capital-intensive manner of facilitating entry into new markets for Belmond. As owner of many unique and luxury properties that Belmond operates itself, Belmond believes it is well positioned to manage comparable hotels for others.


• | Other strategic considerations -- In recent years, management executed on a strategy to reduce Belmond’s long-term debt position. A number of assets not considered key to Belmond’s portfolio of unique, high-valued properties were identified and sold with proceeds being used to reduce debt, re-invest in other properties, and more recently to repurchase the Company's class A common shares. In the last three years, Belmond sold its 50% ownership in the entity which owned

13

Hotel Ritz by Belmond, Madrid, Spain, and the Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond in Maryland for combined total proceeds of $84,189,000, and removed any debt or guarantees related to these properties from its consolidated balance sheets. See Note 4 to the Financial Statements. Management continues to review Belmond's portfolio to identify additional non-core assets and expects that any future asset sales would be encumbered by long-term management agreements for Belmond. See Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Marketing, Sales and Public Relations

Belmond invested $3,110,000 in enhanced promotional and marketing initiatives in 2016 and plans to invest approximately $3,000,000 during 2017 as phase three of its five year strategy to invest approximately $15,000,000 in support of the Belmond brand.

Belmond’s sales and marketing function is primarily based upon direct sales to consumers of travel (prioritizing strategic third-party travel agents, sales representatives and tour operators, and electronic channels such as the Internet and digital marketing), cross-selling to existing customers, and public relations. Belmond has its own corporate sales force located in 16 cities in the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, various European countries, Australia and Japan, and has appointed third-party sales representatives in ten additional cities in Asia and the Middle East. Belmond also has local sales staff responsible for the properties where they are based.

Belmond’s sales staff identify and train preferred travel industry and distribution partners, engage with group and corporate account representatives, and conduct marketing initiatives such as direct mailings, e-commerce, trade show participation and event sponsorship. Revenue is managed using sophisticated room rate and inventory tools. Belmond participates in a number of luxury travel partner programs, such as the “Fine Hotels & Resorts" and "Centurion Hotel Program", both operated by American Express, and the “Virtuoso” travel agent consortium. Belmond offers its top travel agents and other industry partners "by invitation only" participation in Belmond’s “Bellini Club” providing training courses, special commissions and sales support for all Belmond products worldwide.

Consumer advertising, websites and digital marketing are important direct sales and marketing tools for Belmond. Through its principal website (belmond.com), Belmond provides extensive descriptions and images of the products and guest activities in English and five other languages, in addition to bookings and brand wide promotions. Belmond operates other Internet special interest travel portals that direct customers to Belmond’s properties, and works with other selected electronic distribution channels.  Social media such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Pinterest are increasingly significant marketing tools.

Because repeat customers appreciate the consistent quality of Belmond’s hotels, trains and cruises, an important part of Belmond’s strategy is to promote Belmond properties through various cross-selling efforts to engage with Belmond's loyal customer base. These include gifts cards, "Belmond Now" digital magazine in-house directory, customer relationship management systems and other customer recognition programs, worldwide preferred travel agent programs, and direct communications with customers.

Belmond’s marketing strategy also focuses on public relations, which management believes is a highly cost-effective marketing tool for luxury properties. Because of the unique nature of Belmond’s properties, guests often hear about Belmond’s hotels and other travel products through word-of-mouth or published articles. Belmond has an in-house public relations office in London and representatives in 11 countries worldwide, including third-party public relations firms under contract, to promote its properties through targeted newspapers, general interest and travel magazines, and broadcast, online and other media.
Corporate Social Responsibility

Belmond is committed to the implementation of responsible business practices furthering the sustainability of tourism and seeks to ensure that its properties and corporate offices engage with their local communities and environments in a positive manner through their ongoing activities. Examples of these are as follows:

• | Belmond has continued its association with the Sustainable Restaurant Association. The food and beverage operations of 39 of Belmond's properties have been assessed to measure and benchmark their sustainability credentials. Belmond is the first global luxury hospitality brand to have undertaken this third party testing. This testing will continue to inform Belmond's minimum food sustainability, environmental responsibility and ethical sourcing standards during the coming year.


• | In Myanmar, the ship doctors of Belmond Road to Mandalay and Belmond Orcaella run community activities along the Ayeyarwady and Chindwin Rivers in a program dating back to 1995. These include a free clinic that treats thousands of people each year, the construction and long-term support of 25 schools, and irrigation and solar power projects in remote 

14

villages. 2017 sees the launch of the Myanmar Foundation, a UK-based registered charity which will facilitate donations to the program.

• | In Russia, Belmond Grand Hotel Europe works with local orphanages and youth organizations to support those in need. The hotel supports a house in the SOS children's village outside of St. Petersburg for young people without families, where five children aged between 12 and 15 years old are currently being cared for. In addition, the hotel arranges educational tours of its premises for college students and organizes community activities for disadvantaged young people. In 2016, some 28 volunteers participated in a clean-up day, clearing refuse in a nearby forest.


• | In the U.S., Belmond Charleston Place created and coordinates the Charleston Chefs’ “Feed the Need” Program in which local hotels, restaurants and caterers provide weekly meals in food shelters for up to 500 persons. The hotel has now introduced a "Teach the Need" program, teaching hospitality skills to at-risk high school students and helping them find employment. In 2015, it organized an auction that raised over $600,000 for those affected by the Emanuel AME Church tragedy. Now, following the closure of the city center's only budget supermarket, it is fund raising to provide bus transport for disadvantaged and elderly people to purchase food elsewhere.


• | Also in the U.S., Belmond El Encanto is pursuing a number of community initiatives such as donating clothing, toys and other items to low-income families and local shelters. In addition, staff participate in charity races and volunteer as stewards. The hotel has sponsored disadvantaged children to travel to an island national park to learn about its ecosystem. The hotel's long-term environmental initiatives include water conservation and the introduction of moisture-resistant plants to its famous gardens.


• | In Brazil, Belmond Copacabana Palace has continued to develop the sustainability and community programs it initiated in 2009 and the long-standing community programs it formalized in 2012. It now recycles more than 50% of its waste, uses 100% renewable energy, works with sustainable food and flower suppliers and supports Solar Meninos de Luz, a local children's philanthropic organization.


• | Also in Brazil, Belmond Hotel das Cataratas is committed to environmental conservation programs including Projeto Carnivoros do Iguaçu, which has overseen a substantial rise in numbers of endangered animals such as pumas and jaguars within the surrounding national park. The hotel also sponsors a local young people's training program offering youth apprenticeships and work placements for disadvantaged young people. The hotel is committed to environmental conservation and ecological operating programs and was the first South American hotel to be certified for ISO14001– Sustainability and SA8000–Social Responsibility.


• | Our Peru hotels and trains undertake a wide range of community and sustainability initiatives. These include support of local artisans and farmers who receive help to create products and grow crops that our Peru hotels and train purchase at fair trade prices. Belmond Palacio Nazarenas has developed an edible herb garden, Belmond Hotel Rio Sagrado a small orchard, and Belmond Sanctuary Lodge a small greenhouse -- all of which supply their kitchens. Community programs range from planting thousands of trees to clearing waste from riverbanks and beaches. Cultural initiatives include the provision of free train travel for disadvantaged children to Machu Picchu, community initiatives to improve safety along the train tracks, and a film-making program that records local people sharing local traditions and memories. One particular program, Cconamuro, helps train villagers in hospitality skills, enabling them to welcome our guests on cultural day visits that include lunch and the chance to discover aspects of local life.


• | Our Italian hotels are active in a range of sustainability and community initiatives. Our two hotels in Sicily support the annual Taormina International Book Festival and related literary activities, have joined 150 children in a clean-up of nearby Isola Bella beach, and helped raise funds for a local hospital. Belmond Villa San Michele hosted a "dinner in the dark" in support of the Italian Union of the Blind and Partially Sighted, whose students served guests. In addition, staff form the hotel volunteered with Angeli del Bello to clean a public park in Florence. Belmond Hotel Cipriani continued its support of the Senegal village from which its Night Concierge hails. Staff raise funds for the village and also recently shipped a sea container of mattresses, appliances and other goods no longer needed by the hotel to the village.


• | In the UK, Belmond Manoir aux Quat'Saisons supports local community organizations, schools and an animal sanctuary. It is an active member of the Sustainable Restaurant Association and is committed to sourcing local food wherever possible and to nurture and expand its organic gardens, compost waste and care for the environment by, for example, collecting waste kitchen oils and fats and sending them to a recycling plant to be converted to biofuel.

15


• | Belmond offers all full-time staff in its London office the opportunity to use up to 14 hours, or two working days, a year to participate in volunteer projects that benefit its local community. In 2016, more than 40 volunteers undertook gardening work at a local school in one of London's most disadvantaged areas and work at a community farm.

Industry Awards

Belmond has gained a worldwide reputation for quality and service in the luxury segment of the leisure and business travel markets.  Over the years, Belmond’s properties have won numerous national and international awards given by consumer or trade publications such as Condé Nast Traveller, Travel + Leisure, The Sunday Times (UK) and Forbes.com and by private subscription newsletters such as Andrew Harper’s Hideaway Report, or industry bodies such as TripAdvisor. The awards are based on opinion polls of the publications’ readers or the professional opinions of journalists or panels of experts. The awards are believed to influence consumer choice and are therefore highly prized.
Competition

Some of Belmond’s properties are located in areas with numerous competitors. Competition for guests in the hospitality industry is based generally on the convenience of location, the quality of the property and services offered, room rates and menu prices, the range and quality of food services and amenities offered, types of cuisine, and reputation and name recognition.

Belmond’s strategy is to acquire, invest or manage only hotels which have special locations and distinctive character, offering unique travel experiences. Many are in areas with interesting local history or high entry barriers because of zoning restrictions.  Belmond builds its competitive advantage by offering high quality service and cuisine, usually with a local flavor. Typically, therefore, Belmond competes by providing a special combination of location, character, cuisine, service and experiential activities rather than relying on price competition.

Belmond’s luxury tourist trains have no direct competitors at present. Other passenger trains operate on the same or similar routes, including the Cusco-Machu Picchu line of PeruRail, but management believes Belmond’s trains and onboard service are unique and of such superior quality that guests consider a Belmond train journey more of a luxury experience and an end in itself than merely a means of transport. 

Employees

Belmond currently employs approximately 8,600 full-time-equivalent persons.  Approximately 6,000 persons are employed in the hotels, 2,500 in the trains and cruises business, and 116 in central administration, sales and marketing and other activities.  Management believes that Belmond’s ongoing labor relations are satisfactory. Through its various training and other human resources programs, Belmond seeks to attract, develop and retain top employees providing authentic local experiences to guests and to promote internal candidates for leadership positions.
Government Regulation

Belmond and its properties are subject to numerous laws and government regulations such as those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages, liquor service, health and safety of premises and employees, data privacy, employee relationships and welfare, environmental matters, waste and hazardous substance handling and disposal, and planning and zoning rules.
