ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Background
 Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a diversified global media and entertainment company which currently manages and reports its businesses in the following four segments: (i) Cable Network Programming; (ii) Television; (iii) Filmed Entertainment; and (iv) Other, Corporate and Eliminations. The activities of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. are conducted principally in the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia and Latin America. For financial information regarding Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s segments and operations in geographic areas, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the “Annual Report”) to “we,” “us,” “our,” “21st Century Fox,” “Twenty-First Century Fox” or the “Company” means Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 On June 20, 2018, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Merger Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Amended and Restated Merger Agreement”) with The Walt Disney Company (“Disney”) and TWDC Holdco 613 Corp., a newly formed holding company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney (“New Disney”), which amends and restates in its entirety the Agreement and Plan of Merger that the Company entered into with Disney in December 2017, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Disney pursuant to a merger of the Company with a subsidiary of New Disney (the “21CF Merger”). The Company stockholders may elect to receive $38 per share in either cash or shares of New Disney common stock (subject to adjustment for certain tax liabilities). The overall mix of consideration paid to the Company stockholders will be approximately 50% cash and 50% stock. The stock consideration is subject to a collar, which will ensure that the Company stockholders will receive consideration equal to $38 in value if the average Disney stock price at closing is between $93.53 and $114.32. Prior to the consummation of the 21CF Merger, the Company will transfer a portfolio of the Company’s news, sports and broadcast businesses, including the Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, FOX Broadcasting Company, Fox Television Stations Group, FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes and Big Ten Network and certain other assets and liabilities into a newly formed subsidiary (“New Fox”) (the “New Fox Separation”) and distribute all of the issued and outstanding common stock of New Fox to the holders of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (other than holders that are subsidiaries of the Company (shares held by such holders, the “Hook Stock”)) on a pro rata basis (the “New Fox Distribution”). Prior to the New Fox Distribution, New Fox will pay the Company a dividend in the amount of $8.5 billion. New Fox will incur indebtedness sufficient to fund the dividend, which indebtedness will be reduced after the 21CF Merger by the amount of a cash payment paid by Disney to New Fox. As the New Fox Separation and New Fox Distribution will be taxable to the Company at the corporate level, the dividend is intended to fund the taxes resulting from the New Fox Separation and New Fox Distribution and certain other transactions contemplated by the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement (the “Transaction Tax”). The Company will retain all assets and liabilities not transferred to New Fox, including the Twentieth Century Fox Film and Television studios and certain cable and international television businesses, including FX Networks, National Geographic Partners, Regional Sports Networks, Fox Networks Group International and STAR India, as well as the Company’s interests in Hulu LLC (“Hulu”), Sky plc (“Sky”), Tata Sky Limited and Endemol Shine Group. The foregoing proposed transactions are collectively referred to in this report as the “Transaction”. (See Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Disney Transaction/Distribution of New Fox” for further details).
 On June 27, 2018, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it cleared the Transaction. The Company, Disney and the U.S. Department of Justice have entered into a consent decree that allows the Transaction to proceed, while requiring New Disney and the Company to sell the Regional Sports Networks within 90 days following the closing of the Transaction, which consent decree is subject to court approval. At separate special meetings of stockholders on July 27, 2018, the Company’s stockholders adopted the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement, Disney’s stockholders approved the stock issuance, and each company’s stockholders adopted or approved the other proposals voted on at the special meetings.

The consummation of the Transaction remains subject to various conditions, including among others, (i) the consummation of the New Fox Separation, (ii) the receipt of certain tax opinions with respect to the treatment of the Transaction under U.S. and Australian tax laws, and (iii) the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and governmental consents. The Transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2019.
 In December 2016, the Company announced it reached agreement with Sky, in which the Company currently has an approximate 39% interest, on the terms of a recommended pre-conditional cash offer by the Company for the fully diluted share capital of Sky which the Company does not already own (the “Sky Acquisition”), at a price of £10.75 per Sky share subject to certain payments of dividends. On July 11, 2018, the Company announced an increased offer price for the Sky Acquisition, of £14.00 per Sky share (approximately $19.9 billion in the aggregate), payable in cash, subject to reduction if certain dividends or other distributions are paid by Sky (the “Increased Offer”). On August 7, 2018, the Company posted an offer document to Sky shareholders in connection with the Increased Offer and announced that it intends to implement the Sky Acquisition by way of a takeover offer within the meaning of Part 28 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “UK Companies Act”) rather than by means of a scheme of arrangement in accordance with Part 26 of the UK Companies Act, which had been the proposed structure of the Sky Acquisition prior to that date. The Company has noted that the deadline for publication of any revised offer document in respect of its Increased Offer is September 22, 2018.
 In connection with the Increased Offer, on July 11, 2018, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Disney, pursuant to which Disney consented to the increased indebtedness that would be incurred by the Company as a result of the Increased Offer. Also, in the event that Disney does not complete the Mergers due to the failure to obtain regulatory approvals or in certain other limited circumstances, Disney has agreed to reimburse the Company for an amount equal to the difference between the cash consideration of £14.00 and £13.00 for each share of Sky purchased by the Company pursuant to the revised terms of the Increased Offer, plus any interest and fees on such amount.
 The Sky Acquisition has received unconditional clearance by all competent competition authorities including the European Commission, and has been cleared on public interest and plurality grounds. In addition, on July 12, 2018, the Sky Acquisition received approval by the UK Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (the “Secretary of State”), subject to accepted undertakings regarding the divestment of and financial support for Sky News as described in Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Sky Acquisition”. However, the Sky Acquisition is conditional on, among other things, the Company securing valid acceptances of the Increased Offer in respect of Sky shares which represent 75% or more of the Sky shares that the Company does not own. The Company reserves the right to reduce this acceptance condition to a simple majority of all Sky shares (including those held by the Company).
 If the Company does not acquire 100% of Sky pursuant to the Sky Acquisition or another party has not acquired more than 50% of the ordinary shares of Sky, in each case prior to the completion of the Transaction, Disney will be required to make a mandatory offer for all the outstanding ordinary shares of Sky not already owned by the Company within 28 days of the Transaction closing. On July 13, 2018, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers of the United Kingdom (the "U.K. Takeover Panel"), ruled that any such offer would be required to be made in cash and at a price of £14.00 for each ordinary share in Sky (the "July 13 Ruling"), which ruling was upheld on August 3, 2018 by the U.K. Takeover Panel’s Hearings Committee on appeal. Certain interested parties have appealed the ruling of the Hearings Committee to the Takeover Appeal Board.
 On April 25, 2018, Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) announced a pre-conditional cash offer for the fully diluted share capital of Sky at a price of £12.50 per Sky share which was subject to regulatory preconditions (which have now been satisfied) as well as additional closing conditions. On July 11, 2018, Comcast announced a revised cash offer for the fully diluted share capital of Sky at a price of £14.75 per Sky share that was recommended by the independent committee of Sky’s board of directors.

Any increase in the debt financing for the Sky Acquisition or sale by the Company of its interest in Sky would require Disney’s consent. Completion of the Sky Acquisition is not a condition to either party’s obligation to consummate the Transaction. Completion of the Sky Acquisition will not affect the amount or form of consideration that stockholders of the Company receive in the Transaction.
 For further information, see Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “Sky Acquisition”.
 In fiscal 2016, the Company formed National Geographic Partners, LLC with the National Geographic Society to hold the National Geographic Channels (as defined below) and the publishing, travel and certain other businesses that had been owned by the National Geographic Society. For further information, see Note 3 – Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox under the heading “National Geographic Partners”.
 On November 12, 2014, the Company sold its 100% and 57% ownership stakes in Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland AG (“Sky Deutschland”), respectively, to British Sky Broadcasting Group plc (subsequently renamed Sky plc) for approximately $8.8 billion in value comprised of approximately $8.2 billion in cash received, net of $650 million of cash paid to acquire Sky’s 21% interest in NGC Network International LLC (“NGCI”) and NGC Network Latin America LLC (“NGCLA” and together with NGCI, “NGC International”), increasing the Company’s ownership stake in NGC International to 73%. In connection with this transaction, the Company participated in Sky’s equity offering in July 2014 by purchasing additional shares in Sky for approximately $900 million and maintained the Company’s approximate 39% ownership interest. As a result of the transaction, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland ceased to be consolidated subsidiaries of the Company.
 On June 28, 2013, the Company completed the separation of its business into two independent publicly traded companies (the “News Corp Separation”) by distributing to its stockholders shares of the new News Corporation (“News Corp”). The Company retained its interests in a global portfolio of cable, broadcast, film, pay-TV and satellite assets spanning six continents. News Corp holds the Company’s former businesses including newspapers, information services and integrated marketing services, digital real estate services, book publishing, digital education and sports programming and pay-TV distribution in Australia. The Company completed the News Corp Separation by distributing to its stockholders one share of News Corp Class A common stock for every four shares of the Company’s Class A common stock held on June 21, 2013, and one share of News Corp Class B common stock for every four shares of the Company’s Class B common stock held on June 21, 2013. The Company’s stockholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares. Following the News Corp Separation, the Company does not beneficially own any shares of News Corp Class A common stock or News Corp Class B common stock.
 In connection with the News Corp Separation, the Company and News Corp entered into a separation and distribution agreement (the “News Corp Separation and Distribution Agreement”) and certain other related agreements, pursuant to which the Company has agreed to indemnify News Corp and News Corp has agreed to indemnify the Company for certain liabilities.

 Competition
 General. Cable network programming is a highly competitive business.

Important competitive factors include the prices charged for programming, the quantity, quality and variety of programming offered, the accessibility of such programming, the ability to adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms, quality of user experience and the effectiveness of marketing efforts.
 FOX News and FOX Business Network. FOX News Channel’s primary competition comes from the cable networks CNN, HLN (CNN’s Headline News) and MSNBC. FOX Business Network’s primary competition comes from the cable networks CNBC and Bloomberg Television. FOX News Channel and FOX Business Network also compete for viewers and advertisers within a broad spectrum of television networks, including other non-news cable networks and free-to-air broadcast television networks.
 Sports programming operations. A number of basic and pay television programming services, such as ESPN and NBC Sports Network, as well as free-to-air stations and broadcast networks, provide programming that also targets FS1, FS2, BTN and the FSN RSNs’ respective audience. On a national level, the primary competitors to FS1, FS2, BTN and FSN are ESPN, ESPN2, NBC Sports Network, Golf Channel and league-owned networks such as NFL Network, NHL Network, NBA TV and MLB Network. In regional markets, the FSN RSNs and BTN compete with other RSNs (including those operated by team owners, collegiate conferences and cable television distributors), local broadcast television stations and other sports programming providers and distributors. FS1, FS2, BTN and FSN also face competition online from ESPN+, Yahoo Sports, Facebook, Twitter, ESPN.com, NBCSports.com and CBSSports.com, among others.
 In addition, FS1, FS2, BTN, the FSN RSNs and FSN compete, to varying degrees, for sports programming rights. The FSN RSNs compete for local and regional rights with local broadcast television stations and other local and regional sports networks, including sports networks launched by team owners, collegiate conferences and cable television distributors. FS1, FS2, BTN and FSN compete for national rights principally with a number of national cable and broadcast services that specialize in or carry sports programming, including sports networks launched by the leagues and collegiate conferences. Cable television distributors sometimes contract directly with the sports teams in their service area for the right to distribute a number of those teams’ games on their systems. In certain markets, the owners of the cable television distributors, also own one or more of the professional teams in the region, increasing their ability to launch competing networks and also limiting the professional sports rights available for acquisition by the FSN RSNs. Additionally, cable television distributors and online and social media properties such as Amazon, Yahoo Sports, Facebook and Twitter compete with the Company’s cable sports networks by acquiring and distributing sports content to their online users.
 FX and FXX. FX and FXX face competition from a number of basic cable and pay television programming services, such as USA Network (“USA”), TNT, Spike TV, HBO and Showtime, as well as free-to-air broadcast networks, and Internet subscription and rental services such as Netflix and Amazon, and free-to-consumer video sharing websites such as YouTube, that provide programming that targets the same viewing audience as FX and FXX. FX and FXX also face competition from these programming services in the acquisition of distribution rights to movie and series programming.
 National Geographic Partners. In the United States, National Geographic Channels face competition for viewers and advertising from a number of basic cable and broadcast television channels, such as Discovery Channel, History, Animal Planet, Travel Channel, Science, American Heroes Channel, FYI and 
 9


TruTV, as well as free-to-air broadcast networks, sports, news and general entertainment networks which have acquired or produced competing programming and Internet subscription and rental services. Internationally, the National Geographic Channels compete with various local and foreign television services providers and distribution networks, including local broadcasters and factual channels from Discovery Communications and A&E Television Networks, for audiences, advertising, content acquisition and distribution platforms.
 FNG International. Internationally, the Company’s cable businesses compete with various local and foreign television audiovisual services providers and distribution networks for audiences, advertising, content acquisition and linear/nonlinear distribution platforms.
 STAR India. In India, the pay television broadcasting industry and the on-demand streaming business have several participants. STAR India’s channels compete with both pay and free-to-air channels since they are delivered primarily by common cable and DTH. STAR India also competes in India to acquire Hindi and other Indian language film and programming rights, and internationally for English film and programming rights for television series and media rights for sporting events.
 Television
 The Company is engaged in the operation of broadcast television stations and the acquisition, marketing and distribution of broadcast network programming in the United States.

(a) | VHF television stations transmit on Channels 2 through 13 and UHF television stations on Channels 14 through 51. The Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) applies a discount (the “UHF Discount”) which attributes only 50% of the television households in a local television market to the audience reach of a UHF television station for purposes of calculating whether that station’s owner complies with the national station ownership cap imposed by FCC regulations and by statute; in making this calculation, only the station’s RF broadcast channel is considered. In a duopoly market, both stations must be UHF for the discount to apply. In addition, the coverage of two commonly owned stations in the same market is counted only once. The percentages listed are rounded and do not take into account the UHF Discount. For more information regarding the FCC’s national station ownership cap, see “Government Regulation—Television” in this Annual Report.

 In March 2017, the FCC concluded a voluntary auction to reclaim 84 megahertz (“MHz”) of television broadcast station spectrum. Fox Television Stations had three stations’ bids to relinquish spectrum accepted by the FCC as part of the auction. As a result, the spectrum previously utilized by stations WDCA, Washington, DC; WMYT, Charlotte, NC; and WPWR, Chicago, IL has been relinquished to the FCC in June 2018 (WPWR-TV and WMYT-TV) and July 2018 (WDCA). In each of those markets, Fox Television Stations has begun channel sharing arrangements whereby both of its stations in the market operate using a single 6 MHz channel. This enables each of WDCA, WMYT and WPWR to continue its operations. For further information, see “–Business Overview–Government Regulation–Television”.
 
In May 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (“Sinclair”) and Tribune Media Company (“Tribune”) to acquire seven television stations from Tribune for approximately $910 million subject to certain purchase price adjustments. On August 9, 2018, Tribune exercised its right to terminate its merger agreement with Sinclair and correspondingly, the Company’s Purchase Agreement was also terminated.
 FOX Broadcasting Company (“FOX”)
 FOX has 208 FOX Affiliates, including 17 stations owned and operated by the Company, which reach approximately 99.9% of all U.S. television households. In general, each week FOX regularly delivers to its affiliates 15 hours of prime-time programming, 60 minutes of late-night programming on Saturday and 60 minutes of news programming on Sunday. During the 2017-2018 traditional broadcast season, FOX’s prime-time entertainment programming featured such series as 9-1-1, Bob’s Burgers, Empire, Family Guy, The Gifted, Gotham, Lethal Weapon, The Orville, The Resident, Star and The Simpsons; unscripted series such as The Four: Battle for Stardom, Hell’s Kitchen, Master Chef Junior and Showtime at the Apollo; event series such as The X-Files; and event specials such as A Christmas Story Live!. In addition, a significant component of FOX’s programming consists of sports programming, with FOX providing to its affiliates live coverage of the NFC of the NFL (including coverage of the NFC playoffs) and MLB (including post-season and the World Series), as well as live coverage of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (including the Daytona 500), USGA golf events (including the men’s U.S. Open), college football and basketball, UFC and international soccer (including FIFA World Cup events). The Company has acquired rights to the NFL’s Thursday Night Football package and will begin airing live coverage of these games in August 2018.
 FOX’s prime-time line-up is intended to appeal primarily to target audiences of 18 to 49-year old adults, the demographic group that advertisers seek to reach most often, with an emphasis on the 18 to 34-year old adult demographic coveted by advertisers. During the 2017-2018 traditional September to May broadcast season, FOX ranked third among adults ages 18 to 49 (tied with ABC Television Network (“ABC”) and based on Live+7 ratings), just one-tenth of a rating point behind CBS Television Network (“CBS”). FOX ranked second among adults ages 18 to 34 (based on Live+7 ratings). FOX ranked second in prime-time programming among teens ages 12 to 17 (tied with ABC and CBS and based on Live+7 ratings). FOX has ranked among the top two networks in adults ages 18 to 34 for the past 23 years (1995-1996 to 2017-2018) and in teens ages 12 to 17 for the past 27 years (1991-1992 to 2017-2018). FOX’s 9-1-1 ranked among the season’s top three new entertainment series among adults ages 18 to 49, adults ages 18 to 34 and teens ages 12 to 17, while ranking second in the same measures among new dramas. Empire ranked among the season’s top five broadcast dramas among adults ages 18 to 34 and teens ages 12 to 17 for the fourth consecutive season. FOX has seven of the season’s top 20 new series, more than any other network, including: 9-1-1, The Orville, The Gifted, The Resident, and The Four: Battle for Stardom. Inclusive of all telecasts, the median age of the FOX viewer is 51 years, as compared to 55 years for each of ABC and NBC Television Network (“NBC”), and 60 years for CBS. Excluding all 
 12


sports and repeat programming, the median age of the FOX viewer is 50 years, as compared to 56 years for ABC, 57 years for NBC and 61 years for CBS.
 FOX obtains programming from major television studios, including Twentieth Century Fox Television, and independent television production companies pursuant to license agreements. The terms of those agreements generally provide FOX with the right to broadcast a television series for a minimum of four seasons.
 National sports programming is obtained through license agreements with professional or collegiate sports leagues or organizations. FOX’s current licenses with the NFL, MLB, college football and basketball conferences, NASCAR, FIFA and USGA are secured by long-term agreements.
 FOX provides programming to the FOX Affiliates in accordance with affiliation agreements of varying durations, which grant to each affiliate the right to broadcast network television programming on the affiliated station. Such agreements typically run three or more years and have staggered expiration dates. These affiliation agreements require FOX Affiliates to carry FOX programming in all time periods in which FOX programming is offered to those affiliates, subject to certain exceptions stated in the affiliation agreements.
 FOX also distributes programming through its network-branded website, FOX.com, and its FOXNOW application which offer live streaming of FOX shows and programming from many FOX-affiliated broadcast stations, and licenses programming for distribution through the websites and applications of cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators, telecommunications companies and online video distributors.
 MyNetworkTV
 The programming distribution service, Master Distribution Service, Inc. (branded as MyNetworkTV), distributes two hours per night, Monday through Friday, of off-network programming from syndicators to its licensee stations. As of June 30, 2018, MyNetworkTV had license and delivery agreements covering 183 stations, including 10 stations owned and operated by the Company, reaching approximately 97% of U.S. households.
 Competition. The network television broadcasting business is highly competitive. FOX and MyNetworkTV compete for audiences, programming and advertising revenue with other broadcast networks, such as ABC, NBC, CBS and The CW Television Network, independent television stations, cable and direct broadcast satellite distribution services, cable and direct broadcast satellite television networks, as well as other media, including digital platforms, Internet-delivered free, advertising supported, subscription and rental services, and DVDs, Blu-rays and other physical media. In addition, FOX and MyNetworkTV compete with other broadcast networks and programming distribution services to secure affiliations or station agreements with independently owned television stations in markets across the United States. ABC, NBC and CBS each broadcasts a significantly greater number of hours of programming than FOX and, accordingly, may be able to designate or change time periods in which programming is to be broadcast with greater flexibility than FOX. In addition, future technological developments may affect competition within the broadcast television marketplace.
 Each of the stations owned and operated by Fox Television Stations also competes for advertising revenues with other television stations, radio and cable systems in its respective market area, along with other advertising media, such as digital platforms, Internet apps and websites, newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising and direct mail. All of the stations owned and operated by Fox Television Stations are located in highly competitive markets. Additional items that are material to the competitive position of each of the television stations include management experience, authorized power and assigned frequency of that station. Competition for sales of broadcast advertising time is based primarily on the anticipated and actually delivered size and demographic characteristics of audiences as determined by various rating services, price, the time of day when the advertising is to be broadcast, competition from the other broadcast networks, cable television systems, Direct Broadcast Satellite Television (“DBS”) 
 13


services and digital media and general economic conditions. Competition for audiences is based primarily on the selection of programming, the acceptance of which is dependent on the reaction of the viewing public, which is often difficult to predict.
 Filmed Entertainment
 The Company is engaged in the production and acquisition of live-action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media worldwide, and the production and licensing of television programming worldwide.
Motion Picture Production and Distribution
 One of the world’s largest producers and distributors of motion pictures, Twentieth Century Fox Film (“TCFF”) produces, acquires and distributes motion pictures throughout the world under a variety of arrangements. During fiscal 2018, TCFF placed 19 motion pictures in general release in the United States. The motion pictures of TCFF are produced and/or distributed by the following units of TCFF: Twentieth Century Fox and Fox 2000, which produce and acquire motion pictures for mainstream audiences; Fox Searchlight Pictures, which produces and acquires specialized motion pictures; and Twentieth Century Fox Animation, which produces feature length animated motion pictures. In addition, Fox International Productions, Inc. co-produces, co-finances and acquires local-language motion pictures primarily for distribution outside the United States. The motion pictures produced and/or distributed by TCFF in the United States and international territories in fiscal 2018 included War for the Planet of the Apes, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Murder on the Orient Express, The Greatest Showman, Deadpool 2, The Shape of Water and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. TCFF has released or currently plans to release approximately 20 motion pictures in the United States in fiscal 2019, including The Hate U Give, Bohemian Rhapsody, Alita: Battle Angel, X-Men: Dark Phoenix, Can You Ever Forgive Me, The Favourite and The Aftermath. Pursuant to an agreement with Monarchy Enterprises Holdings B.V. (“MEH”), the parent company of New Regency, and certain of MEH’s subsidiaries, TCFF distributes certain New Regency films and all films co-financed by TCFF and New Regency in all media worldwide, excluding a number of international territories with respect to television rights. Among its fiscal 2019 releases, TCFF currently expects to distribute three co-financed films with New Regency.
 The Company’s arrangement with DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. (“DWA”) for domestic and international distribution of DWA’s new release animated motion pictures and certain other library motion pictures and programming controlled by DWA expired in December 2017. The Company had home entertainment rights to DWA titles for part of fiscal 2018 and has certain television distribution rights through early fiscal 2019, and titles included in approved television distribution licenses may have exhibition periods continuing after that date.
 Motion picture companies, such as TCFF, typically seek to generate revenues from various distribution channels. TCFF derives its worldwide revenues from motion pictures and other program distribution primarily from four basic sources (set forth in general chronology of exploitation): (i) distribution of motion pictures for theatrical exhibition in the United States and Canada and markets outside of the United States and Canada (“international” markets); (ii) distribution of motion pictures and other programming in various home media formats, including digital distribution; (iii) distribution of motion pictures and other programming for exhibition on premium pay and SVOD services; and (iv) distribution of motion pictures and other programming for exhibition on free television networks, other broadcast program services, independent television stations and basic cable programming services, including certain services which are affiliates of the Company. The Company does not always have rights in all media of exhibition to all motion pictures that it releases, and does not necessarily distribute a given motion picture in all of the foregoing media in all markets. The Company believes that the pre-release marketing of a feature film is an integral part of its motion picture distribution strategy and generally begins marketing efforts three to six months in advance of a film’s release date in any given territory. The Company markets and distributes its films worldwide principally through its own companies.
 14


Through Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment LLC and TCFF, the Company distributes motion pictures and other programming produced by units of TCFF, its affiliates and other producers in the United States, Canada and international markets in all home media formats, including the sale and rental of DVDs and Blu-rays. In fiscal 2018, the domestic home entertainment division released or re-released approximately 1,136 produced and acquired titles, including 23 new TCFF film releases, approximately 680 catalog titles and approximately 433 television and non-theatrical titles. In international markets, the Company distributed, produced and acquired titles both directly and through foreign distribution channels, with approximately 931 releases in fiscal 2018, including approximately 27 new TCFF film releases, approximately 584 catalog titles and approximately 320 television and non-theatrical releases. The Company enters into domestic and international license arrangements with third parties for distribution by electronic sell-through (“EST”), video-on-demand (“VOD”) and/or pay-per-view (“PPV”). Distribution on an EST basis enables consumers to acquire the right to retain programs on a permanent basis. The EST, VOD and PPV arrangements generally provide for license fees based on a percentage of the licensee’s gross receipts received from consumers and in some cases a guaranteed minimum fee per consumer transaction. In addition, these arrangements generally provide for a minimum number of scheduled PPV exhibitions per program and for continuous VOD availability of each program to consumers during a fixed period. In fiscal 2018, the Company continued its worldwide home video distribution arrangement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (“MGM”), releasing approximately 331 MGM home entertainment theatrical, catalog and television programs domestically and 315 internationally. The Company also continued its domestic home video distribution arrangements with Lions Gate Films Inc. (“Lions Gate”) (U.S. only), including titles from Anchor Bay Entertainment, LLC (“Anchor Bay”) (U.S. and Canada), releasing approximately 1,347 Lions Gate (including Anchor Bay) home entertainment theatrical, catalog and television programs. During fiscal 2018, the domestic home entertainment division released 462 Blu-ray titles, including 22 new TCFF film releases, 364 catalog titles and 76 television and non-theatrical releases. In international markets, the Company released 466 Blu-ray titles, including 23 new TCFF film releases, 378 catalog titles and 65 television and non-theatrical releases. The Company also distributed 164 Blu-ray titles from MGM domestically and 127 titles internationally and 481 Blu-ray titles from Lions Gate (including Anchor Bay) domestically.
 Units of TCFF license motion pictures and other programming in the United States and international markets to various third party and certain affiliated subscription pay television services, SVOD services, free television networks and basic cable programming services for distribution by means of various media, which may include DBS, cable television systems and the Internet. The license agreements reflecting the subscription pay television arrangements generally provide for a specified number of exhibitions of the program during a fixed term in exchange for a license fee that is based on a variety of factors, including the box office performance of each program and the number of subscribers to the service or system. Among third party license arrangements that units of TCFF have in place in the United States for subscription pay television exhibition of motion pictures is an exclusive license agreement with HBO, providing for the licensing of films initially released for theatrical exhibition. Units of TCFF also license programming to SVOD services in the United States. Such licenses enable the consumer to view individual programming selected by the viewer for a subscription fee, typically on a monthly basis. In international markets, units of TCFF license motion pictures and other programming to subscription pay television and SVOD services operated by leading third parties, as well as to such services operated by various affiliated entities of the Company. In addition, units of TCFF license motion pictures and other programming in international markets for exhibition on free television networks, including basic cable programming services, both to independent third party broadcasters as well as to services operated by affiliated entities of the Company.
 Competition. Motion picture production and distribution are highly competitive businesses. The Company competes with other film studios, independent production companies and others including additional entrants into the market for the acquisition of artistic properties, the services of creative and technical personnel, exhibition outlets and the public’s interest in its products. The number of motion pictures released by the Company’s competitors, particularly the other major film studios, in any given period may create an oversupply of product in the market, which may reduce the Company’s shares of gross box office admissions and may make it more difficult for the Company’s motion pictures to succeed. The commercial success of the motion pictures produced and/or distributed by the Company is affected 
 15


substantially by the public’s unpredictable response to them. The competitive risks affecting the Company’s home entertainment business include the number of home entertainment titles released by the Company’s competitors that may create an oversupply of product in the market, competition among home media formats, such as DVDs and Blu-rays, and other methods of distribution, such as EST and VOD services.
 The Company faces ongoing risks associated with controlling unauthorized copying and distribution of the Company’s programs. For a further discussion of issues relating to unauthorized copying and distribution of the Company’s programs, see “—Intellectual Property.”
 Television Programming, Production and Domestic Syndication Distribution
 Twentieth Century Fox Television (“TCFTV”). During fiscal 2018, TCFTV produced television programs for FOX, FX, ABC, NBC, CBS, Turner Broadcasting System (“TBS”), and Netflix. TCFTV currently produces, or has orders to produce, episodes of the following television series: 9-1-1, Bob’s Burgers, The Cool Kids, Empire, Family Guy, The Gifted, Last Man Standing, The Orville, The Passage, Proven Innocent, Rel, Rent (live musical event), The Resident, The Simpsons and Star for FOX; American Horror Story for FX; Fresh Off The Boat, Modern Family, Single Parents and Speechless for ABC; This Is Us for NBC; Life in Pieces for CBS; American Dad for TBS; Arrested Development and Mixtape for Netflix; and Central Park for Apple. Generally, a television network or cable network will license a specified number of episodes for exhibition during the license period. All other distribution rights, including international and off-network syndication rights, are typically retained by TCFTV, utilized by other units of the Company or sold to third parties.
 Fox21 Television Studios (“Fox21”). Fox21 produces television programs for major U.S. cable networks and SVOD services including American Crime Story, Mayans MC and Pose for FX; The Chi and Homeland for Showtime; Queen of the South for USA; The Politician and Ratched for Netflix; and Genius and The Hot Zone for National Geographic Channel.
 Television programs generally are produced under contracts that provide for license fees that may cover only a portion of the anticipated production costs. As these costs have increased in recent years, the resulting deficit between production costs and license fees for domestic first-run programming also has increased. Therefore, additional licensing is often critical to the financial success of a series. Successful U.S. network television series are typically (i) licensed for first-run exhibition in international markets, (ii) made available for EST, including individual episodes and full series, (iii) licensed for VOD, PPV and SVOD services, including individual episodes and full series, (iv) released in DVD and Blu-ray box sets, (v) licensed for off-network exhibition in the United States (including in syndication and to cable programmers) and (vi) licensed for further television exhibition in international markets. Typically, a series must be broadcast for at least three to four television seasons for there to be a sufficient number of episodes to offer the series in syndication or to cable and DBS programmers in the United States. The decision of a television network to continue a series through an entire television season or to renew a series for another television season depends largely on the series’ audience ratings.
 Twentieth Television. Twentieth Television licenses both television programming and feature films for domestic syndication to television stations, basic cable and advertising-supported video-on-demand (“AVOD”) services in the United States. Twentieth Television distributes a program portfolio that includes the Company’s library of television and film assets, and first-run programming for sales to local stations, including stations owned and operated by the Company, as well as to basic cable networks.
 Twentieth Television derives revenue from off-network, theatrical and first-run program sales in the form of cash license fees paid by broadcast, cable and AVOD licensees, and from the sales of national advertising units retained by Twentieth Television in its programs. Twentieth Television licenses such shows as Modern Family, New Girl, Last Man Standing, Archer, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Family Guy, Bones, How I Met Your Mother, The Cleveland Show, Bob’s Burgers and The Simpsons to cable and broadcast networks. First-run programs distributed by Twentieth Television include television’s longest running court show Divorce Court, the entertainment magazine program Dish Nation, Top 30 and 
 16


the daily pop culture program Page Six TV. Additionally, Twentieth Television also sells national advertising on behalf of other third party syndicators.
 Competition. Similar to motion picture production and distribution, production and distribution of television programming is extremely competitive. The Company competes with other film studios, independent production companies, Internet subscription and rental service providers including additional entrants into the market, and others for the acquisition of artistic properties, the services of creative and technical personnel, exhibition outlets and the public’s interest in its products. In addition, television networks have affiliated production companies from which they are increasingly obtaining their programming, which has reduced the demand for programming from other non-affiliated parties.
Motion Picture and Television Library
 The Company’s motion picture and television library (the “Fox Library”) consists of varying ownership and distribution rights to several thousand previously released motion pictures and many well-known television programs. Motion pictures in the Fox Library include many successful and well-known titles, such as The Sound of Music, Mrs. Doubtfire, Home Alone, the Star Wars series (original six episodes), the Die Hard series, the X-Men series, Independence Day, the Ice Age series, The Planet of the Apes series, Sideways, Walk the Line, The Devil Wears Prada, Little Miss Sunshine, the Night at the Museum series, the Alvin and the Chipmunks series, Slumdog Millionaire, Juno, Life of Pi, the Taken series, 12 Years a Slave, The Martian, The Greatest Showman and Deadpool. In addition, the Company has distributed the top two box office grossing films of all time worldwide, which are Avatar and Titanic (together with Paramount Pictures Corporation).

 Government Regulation
 General
 Various aspects of the Company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. The Company believes that it is in material compliance with the requirements imposed by those laws and regulations described herein. The introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Company’s products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on the interests of the Company.
Cable Network Programming
 Asia. Most countries in which the Company operates have a regulatory framework for the satellite and cable television industry. Government regulation of direct reception and redistribution via cable or other means of satellite television signals, where it is addressed at all, is treated differently in each country. At one extreme are absolute bans on private ownership of satellite receiving equipment. Some countries, however, have adopted a less restrictive approach, opting to allow ownership of satellite receiving equipment by certain institutions and individuals but allowing them to receive only authorized broadcasts. At the opposite end of the spectrum are countries where private satellite dish ownership is 
 18


allowed and laws and regulations have been adopted which support popular access to satellite services through local cable redistribution.
 Most television services within Asia, whether free-to-air or pay television, are also subject to licensing requirements. In addition, most countries in which the Company operates control the content offered by local broadcast operators through censorship requirements and standards and practices policies to which program suppliers, such as the Company, are subject. Certain countries also require a minimum percentage of local content or restrict foreign channels available within a market. Other countries require local broadcast operators to obtain government approval to retransmit foreign programming.
 Additional categories of regulation of actual or potential significance to the Company are restrictions on foreign investment in distribution platforms and broadcast licensees, limitations on foreign participation in local television programming production, limitations on exclusive arrangements for channel distribution and non-discrimination requirements for supply or carriage of programming and anti-competition or anti-trust legislation. Such restrictions are different in each country.
 India. Television viewers receive broadcast television signals primarily through terrestrial and cable delivery and through DTH and IPTV delivery. Terrestrial broadcasting remains the domain of government-owned broadcast stations. The government allows 100% foreign direct investment in distribution platforms and 49% foreign direct investment in news and current affairs. Effective November 2015, government approval is no longer required for foreign direct investment in non-“news and current affairs” (i.e. entertainment) television channels. In addition, the government does not permit broadcasters to own directly more than 20% of a DTH platform.
 All distribution platforms are required to carry certain government-operated channels. Retransmissions of foreign satellite channels, such as STAR India’s channels, are permitted, subject to licensing requirements and compliance with local applicable laws, including programming and advertisement codes. Indian law requires that all film content, whether produced in India or abroad, be certified by the Central Board of Film Certification prior to exhibition in India and also places certain restrictions on advertising content. The Indian Broadcasting Foundation has issued Self-Regulatory Guidelines that apply to the programming on non-news and current affairs channels. 
 Broadcasters are required to provide their channels on non-discriminatory terms to all distributors if no carriage charges are being sought from broadcasters. In 2011, the Cable Television Act was amended and new rules were issued mandating that cable networks switch from analog to digital systems. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (the “TRAI”) issued rules that mandated, among other things, basic service tiers comprised of free-to-air channels be compulsorily offered to consumers.
 Channel prices in India have been frozen since 2003 and occasional inflationary adjustments have been allowed in the past. The TRAI allowed a 27.5% inflation based increase in channel rates that was to be implemented by January 1, 2015. However, the Indian court remanded the matter back to the TRAI for reconsideration. In May 2016, the TRAI struck down the increase and held that no inflationary hikes are required. The Company, along with other broadcasters, has filed an appeal before the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal which is pending.
 The TRAI introduced new interconnect and tariff regulations which, among other things, cap the maximum retail price per subscriber per month for channels offered as part of a bouquet. These regulations were challenged by STAR India on the basis that, among other things, the TRAI does not have the authority to regulate the price and manner of offering of television channels which are also protected as broadcast reproduction rights under the Indian Copyright Act. In May 2018, the regulations became effective. STAR India has appealed the decision in the Supreme Court of India however, subject to guidance on implementation, the regulations are not expected to negatively impact STAR India’s business.
 19


The TRAI enacted regulations in March 2013 that limit the amount of advertising time allowed on television channels. These regulations replaced the regulations enacted by the TRAI in May 2012 that had been challenged in the Indian courts. The March 2013 regulations have also been challenged and such challenges are currently pending in the Indian courts.
 The Indian government has mandated sports content rights owners to simultaneously share a feed free of advertisements of the live broadcasting signal of sporting events of national importance with the Indian government owned broadcaster to enable it to re-transmit the signal on its terrestrial networks and DTH networks. For such shared events, the regulations also provide for sharing of advertising revenue, 75% to the content rights owners and 25% to the government owned broadcaster.
 The copyright laws in India were amended in June 2012 to provide, among other things, for rights to receive royalties by authors of underlying work upon exploitation of the work by a broadcaster and to permit broadcasters to access content under a statutory license at royalty rates to be determined by the authorized copyright body once it is established. In November 2017, the Indian Performing Rights Society (“IPRS”) was authorized as the governing copyright body. In March 2018, the IPRS proposed tariff rates for payment of royalties by broadcasters.
 Latin America. The Company broadcasts television programming throughout approximately 18 Latin American countries, as well as the Caribbean. Certain countries in which the Company operates have a regulatory framework for the satellite and cable television industry. These regulations vary in each country as does their impact on the Company’s business. In Argentina, pay-TV operators are required to carry certain government operated channels. In addition, Argentina regulations require, among other things, registration of all channels and production companies and reduced the available advertising inventory on the channels by half to six minutes per hour, which must be accumulated within a four-hour consecutive programming block. In Brazil, regulations require, among other things: (i) that all channels distributed in the region contain at least three hours and thirty minutes per week of Brazilian content during prime time hours (the “Quota Requirement”), half of which must be produced by a Brazilian independent producer; (ii) registration of all channels, programmers, local content and advertisements; (iii) website disclosure of programming and advertising content to ensure compliance with tax and other regulations; and (iv) mediation of local agency requirements and taxation on all advertising that is contracted abroad. While such tax shall primarily be paid by advertisers, programmers are ultimately responsible for the tax payment, and failure by advertisers to pay the required tax could subject programmers to fines or penalties. In order to encourage the local industry and the production of Brazilian content, new restrictions continue to be established defining the type of content that may be considered Brazilian content for purposes of the Quota Requirement. Compliance with these regulations increases the cost of doing business by imposing additional production/acquisition costs as well as third party administrative and legal expenses.
 Europe. The sectors in which the Company operates in Europe are subject to both general competition laws and sector specific regulation. The regulatory regime applicable to the electronic communications and broadcasting sectors is, to a large extent, based on European Union (“EU”) law comprised in various EU directives that require EU member states to adopt national legislation to give effect to the directives’ objectives, while leaving the precise manner and form of the national legislation to the discretion of each member state. The Electronic Communications Directives regulate the provision of communication services, including networks and transmission services that are involved in the broadcasting of television services as well as the provisions of services and facilities associated with the operation of digital television platforms. The AudioVisual Media Services Directive sets out the basic principles for the regulation of television broadcasting activity, including broadcasting licensing, advertising and content regulation, and imposes production and investment quotas, obligations to transmit European content for at least 50% of the day and limitations on advertising time. The Satellite and Cable Directive provides the European legal framework for the right of communication to the public by satellite and for the retransmission of broadcast signals from one member state by cable operators in another member state. Each European country also has the right to adopt more strict rules.

In January 2014, the European Commission (“EC”) initiated formal antitrust proceedings to examine certain provisions in licensing agreements between several U.S. film studios, including Twentieth Century Fox, and a number of European pay-TV broadcasters, including Sky Italia, Sky Deutschland and Sky UK. The EC is investigating provisions which prevent broadcasters from providing their services across borders, for example by refusing potential subscribers from other EU countries or blocking cross-border online access to their services. In July 2015, the EC sent a Statement of Objections to Twentieth Century Fox, several other U.S. film studios and Sky UK taking the preliminary view that such contractual provisions may breach EU competition rules prohibiting anti-competitive agreements. In January 2016, the EC held a hearing on the matter. The Statement of Objections, which sets out the preliminary position of the EU, and the hearing do not represent a finding of infringement or prejudge the outcome of the investigation. The EC continues to investigate the license agreements between the film studios and other European broadcasters. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the EC’s proceedings, including whether fines, if any, may be imposed, or the impact on the Company’s business.
 In April 2018, the EC conducted unannounced inspections in several member states at the premises of companies active in the distribution of sports media rights and the broadcasting of various sports events. The EC inspections are related to concerns that the EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices may have been violated. Unannounced inspections are a preliminary step into suspected anticompetitive practices but the fact that the EC carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behavior nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself. One office of the Company was subject to an inspection and the Company is cooperating with the investigation. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the EC’s investigation, including whether fines, if any, may be imposed, or the impact on the Company’s business.
 Since 2015, as part of its Digital Single Market Strategy, the EC commenced a number of initiatives, including legislative proposals to allow for broader access to online content across EU countries, as well as consultations to review the Satellite and Cable Directive, the AudioVisual Media Services Directive and the Electronic Communications Directive. The EC adopted new portability regulations, which became effective on April 1, 2018, to allow consumers who paid for online content services in their home country to access them when visiting another country within the EU. It is not possible to predict the impact of these portability regulations or other initiatives on the Company’s business or the timing or outcome of other initiatives.
 Television
 In general, the television broadcast industry in the United States is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The FCC regulates television broadcasting, and certain aspects of the operations of cable, satellite and other electronic media that compete with broadcasting, pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”).
 The Communications Act permits the operation of television broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants television broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and, upon application, may renew the licenses for additional terms. Under the Communications Act, television broadcast licenses may be granted for a maximum permitted term of eight years. Generally, the FCC renews broadcast licenses upon finding that: (i) the television station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and (iii) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. After considering these factors, the FCC may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a lesser term than the maximum otherwise permitted, or hold an evidentiary hearing. Currently Fox Television Stations has no pending renewal applications for its television station licenses. For information on the television stations owned and operated by the Company, see “—Fox Television Stations” above.

In March 2010, the FCC delivered its national Broadband Plan to Congress, which reviewed the nation’s broadband Internet infrastructure and recommended a number of initiatives to spur broadband deployment and use. In order to free up more spectrum for wireless broadband services, the Broadband Plan proposed to make spectrum available, including 120 MHz of broadcast spectrum, by incentivizing current private-sector spectrum holders to return some of their spectrum to the government through such initiatives as voluntary “incentive” spectrum auctions (with current licensees permitted to share in the auction proceeds) and “repacking” of channel assignments to increase efficient spectrum usage. Over time, if voluntary measures fail to yield the amount of spectrum the FCC deems necessary for wireless broadband deployment, the Broadband Plan proposed various mandates to reclaim spectrum, such as forced channel sharing. In response to the Broadband Plan, Congress passed legislation in February 2012 authorizing the FCC to conduct a voluntary auction of television broadcast station spectrum. That auction concluded in March 2017 with the FCC reclaiming 84 MHz of broadcast spectrum. Stations that continue their operations may be “repacked” into the remaining, smaller broadcast spectrum band, and some stations may have to change channels as part of a 39-month transition process. In implementing the auction, the FCC was required by legislation to assist stations in retaining their current coverage areas and to establish a fund to reimburse broadcasters for reasonable channel relocation expenses. Fox Television Stations had three stations’ bids to relinquish spectrum accepted by the FCC as part of the auction. Of its remaining stations, nine will be required to repack during the transition. The broadcast industry is continuing to explore additional uses for currently allocated spectrum. It is expected that the FCC repacking will take several years to complete. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of implementation of any additional steps under the Broadband Plan or the repacking, or their effect on the Company.
 On December 22, 2011, the FCC commenced a quadrennial review of its broadcast ownership regulations as required by the 1996 Telecom Act, proposing only minor modifications to its rules. That review was never completed. In early 2014, the FCC announced its intention to combine the 2011 review with the quadrennial review scheduled for 2014. The FCC completed the 2014 review in August 2016. The FCC adopted only minor modifications that were not likely to affect the impact of the FCC ownership rules on the Company’s ownership of media properties. Several parties, however, sought reconsideration of the FCC’s decision, asking that the FCC eliminate the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, which prohibited common ownership of broadcast stations and daily newspapers, as well as the local television ownership rule limiting the number of stations that a single entity can own in any geographic market. In November 2017, the FCC issued a reconsideration order that (1) eliminated the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule and (2) relaxed the local television ownership rule so that, among other things, station owners could petition the FCC to permit ownership of two stations both ranked among the top four in a market. The reconsideration order is currently the subject of an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the appeal.
 Fox Television Stations is in compliance with the rules governing ownership of multiple stations in the same market and with the national station ownership cap established by Congress. In August 2016, the FCC adopted an order to eliminate the so-called “UHF discount” under which UHF stations are attributed with only 50% of the television households in their markets for purposes of calculating compliance with the national station ownership cap. Following a request for reconsideration, however, the FCC reversed its decision and reinstated the UHF discount in April 2017. In July 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit dismissed a petition that had sought to overturn the FCC’s decision to reinstate the UHF discount. As a result, the UHF discount remains in effect. If the FCC determines in the future to again eliminate the UHF discount, it may affect the Company’s ability to acquire television stations in additional markets. Even in the event that the UHF discount is again eliminated, the Company’s national audience reach would remain below the national station ownership cap, based on stations the Company currently owns. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of future proceedings at the FCC relating to the national station ownership cap. 
 Fox Television Stations owns two television stations in the New York DMA. By virtue of the Murdoch Family Trust’s ownership interest in both News Corp and the Company, Fox Television Stations also retains an attributable interest in The New York Post, a daily newspaper in the New York DMA. On

October 6, 2006, the FCC reaffirmed the Company’s permanent waiver of the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, which allows the common ownership of the The New York Post and WNYW (TV). On August 8, 2014, the FCC’s Media Bureau granted a new temporary waiver of the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule to permit the common ownership of the The New York Post and WWOR-TV; the waiver was set to remain in effect until 90 days after the effective date of an FCC order in the 2014 quadrennial review of the media ownership regulations (concluded in 2016) that either adopts a new rule or upholds the existing rule, at which time Fox Television Stations was required to either (1) comply with the rule then in effect or (2) file a new request for a waiver of such rule. Fox Television Stations therefore filed with the FCC a request for a new waiver on February 28, 2017. Fox Television Stations also filed a request for a brief extension of the pre-existing temporary waiver to the extent necessary to preserve the status quo while the FCC reviews the matter. Parties opposed to the waiver request filed objections with the FCC. As noted above, the FCC eliminated the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule in November 2017, a decision that is now the subject of judicial review. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the court’s review or any potential remand proceeding at the FCC or their effect on the Company.
 In addition, if the elimination of the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule is overturned by the court, the Company’s future conduct, including the acquisition of any broadcast networks, or stations or any newspapers, in the same local markets in which News Corp owns or operates newspapers or has acquired television stations, may affect News Corp’s ability to own and operate its newspapers or any television stations it acquires or otherwise comply with the rules. Therefore, the Company and News Corp agreed in the News Corp Separation and Distribution Agreement that if the Company acquires, after the News Corp Separation, newspapers, radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the U.S. and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede News Corp’s business, then the Company will be required to take certain actions, including divesting assets, in order to permit News Corp to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules.
 Under the Communications Act, no broadcast station licensees may be owned by a corporation if more than 25% of the corporation’s stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, their representatives, or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. The Company owns broadcast station licensees in connection with its ownership and operation of U.S. television stations. In August 2016, the Company eliminated a suspension of 10% of the voting rights of shares of Class B Common Stock held by non-U.S. stockholders that had been in place in order to maintain compliance with U.S. law. The FCC could review the Company’s compliance with the Act in connection with its consideration of Fox Television Stations’ license renewal applications.
 FCC regulations implementing the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 require each television broadcaster to elect, at three-year intervals, either to (i) require carriage of its signal by cable systems in the station’s market (“must carry”) or (ii) negotiate the terms on which that broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the cable systems within its market (“retransmission consent”). Generally, the Company has elected retransmission consent for the stations owned and operated by Fox Television Stations. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 requires satellite carriers to carry upon request all television stations located in markets in which the satellite carrier retransmits at least one local station pursuant to the copyright license provided in the statute (“Carry One, Carry All”). FCC regulations implementing this statutory provision require affected stations to elect either mandatory carriage at the same three year intervals applicable to cable “must carry” or negotiate carriage terms with the satellite operators. On September 2, 2015, the FCC initiated a new proposed rulemaking seeking comment on whether the FCC should make changes to its rules that require commercial broadcast television stations to negotiate retransmission consent with cable and satellite operators in “good faith.” The Chairman of the FCC announced in July 2016 that the Commission will not proceed at this time to adopt additional rules governing good faith negotiations for retransmission consent. However, the notice of proposed rulemaking remains pending.
 Legislation enacted in 1990 limits the amount of commercial matter that may be broadcast during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger. In addition, under FCC license renewal processing guidelines, television stations are generally required to broadcast a minimum of three hours 
 23


per week of programming, which, among other requirements, must serve, as a “significant purpose,” the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under. A television station found not to have complied with the programming requirements or commercial limitations could face sanctions, including monetary fines and the possible non-renewal of its license. The FCC announced in July 2018 a proposal to reconsider the three-hour programming obligation as part of a broad review of its children’s programming rules. It is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of any FCC action in response to this review.
 FCC rules prohibit the broadcast by television and radio stations of indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Beginning in March 2004, the FCC implemented a new policy regarding this prohibition and generally stepped up its enforcement of indecency violations. Under the new policy, the single use of certain forbidden expletives, or variations of those expletives, were deemed “indecent” and “profane.” The FCC also warned broadcasters that serious multiple violations of the indecency prohibition could lead to license revocation proceedings, and that fines could be imposed for each incident in a single broadcast. Under the new FCC policy, both complaints about indecency and FCC enforcement actions have increased, and several complaints alleging the broadcast of alleged indecent or profane material by Fox Television Stations are believed to be pending at the FCC. The law currently authorizes the FCC to impose fines of up to $350,000 per incident for violation of the prohibition against indecent and profane broadcasts.
 On March 15, 2006, the FCC determined that the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards programs, both live broadcasts on FOX, violated the prohibitions against indecent and profane broadcasts because they contained isolated uses of the forbidden expletives. On June 21, 2012, the Supreme Court decided that the FCC failed to give FOX fair notice that the isolated use of expletives could violate the indecency prohibition and therefore the Commission’s standards as applied to the broadcasts in question were unconstitutionally vague. The Court vacated the violations for the Billboard Music Awards broadcasts. On April 1, 2013, the FCC announced it had reduced the backlog of pending indecency complaints and would focus its enforcement on “egregious” cases. The FCC also sought public comment on whether its indecency policies should be altered in light of the Supreme Court’s decision. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the FCC’s inquiry or how it will enforce its indecency rules in the future.
 On February 22, 2008, the FCC issued an order imposing forfeitures of $7,000 each on 13 FOX Affiliates, including five stations owned and operated by the Company, on the grounds that an April 7, 2003 episode of the program Married by America violated the prohibition against indecent broadcasts. On April 4, 2008, the United States commenced an action in federal district court in the District of Columbia against the five Company-owned stations to collect the forfeitures imposed by the FCC. In 2012, the government voluntarily dismissed this collection action. The Company subsequently petitioned the FCC to vacate the forfeitures against the Company and other FOX stations that had been found to have violated the indecency prohibition. The petition remains pending and it is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of FCC action.
 Modifications to the Company’s programming to reduce the risk of indecency violations could have an adverse effect on the competitive position of Fox Television Stations and FOX. If indecency regulation is extended to Internet or cable and satellite programming, and such extension was found to be constitutional, some of the Company’s other programming services could be subject to additional regulation that might affect subscription and viewership levels.
 The FCC continues to enforce strictly its regulations concerning sponsorship identification, political advertising, children’s television, environmental concerns, equal employment opportunity, technical operating matters and antenna tower maintenance. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has increased its focus on unfair and deceptive advertising practices, particularly with respect to social media marketing. Both FCC and FTC rules and guidance require marketers to clearly and conspicuously disclose whenever there has been payment for a marketing message or when there is a material connection between an advertiser and a product endorser. FCC rules also require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming. A federal law enacted in late 2010 requires affiliates of the four largest broadcast networks in the 25 largest markets to carry 50 hours of prime time or children’s 
 24


programming per calendar quarter with video descriptions, i.e., a verbal description of key visual elements inserted into natural pauses in the audio and broadcast over a separate audio channel. Cable and satellite operators with 50,000 or more subscribers must do the same on each of the top five non-broadcast networks they carry. Compliance has been required since July 1, 2012 and, as of July 1, 2015, applies to FOX affiliates in the Top 60 markets. Fox News Channel, which from time to time has been among the top five non-broadcast networks, falls within the statutory exemption for “live or near-live” programming. In July 2017, the FCC modified its video description rules to require covered stations and networks to carry 87.5 hours of prime time or children’s programming per calendar quarter with video descriptions. The same statute requires programming that was captioned on television to retain captions when distributed via Internet Protocol apps or services. Although not required by FCC regulation, the Company has committed to provide program ratings information for its broadcast network programming for use in conjunction with V-Chip technology, which blocks the display of television programming based on its rating. The Company has also agreed to make this ratings information available for all full-length entertainment programs that stream on websites the Company controls. FCC regulations governing network affiliation agreements mandate that television broadcast station licensees retain the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures, periodic reporting conditions, short-term license renewals and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of license. Violation of FTC-imposed obligations can result in enforcement actions, litigation, consent decrees and, ultimately, substantial monetary fines.
 Filmed Entertainment 
 United States. TCFF is subject to the provisions of so-called “trade practice laws” in effect in approximately half of the states relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures. These laws substantially restrict the licensing of motion pictures unless theater owners are first invited to attend a screening of the motion pictures and, in certain instances, also prohibit payment of advances and guarantees to motion picture distributors by exhibitors. Further, pursuant to various consent judgments, TCFF and certain other motion picture companies are subject to certain restrictions on their trade practices in the United States, including a requirement to offer motion pictures for exhibition to theaters on a theater-by-theater basis and, in some cases, a prohibition against the ownership of theaters.
 Other International Regulation. In countries outside of the United States, there are a variety of existing or contemplated governmental laws and regulations that may affect the ability of TCFF to distribute and/or license its motion picture and television products to cinema, television or in-home media, including copyright laws and regulations that may or may not be adequate to protect its interests, cinema screen quotas, television quotas, contract term limitations, discriminatory taxes and other discriminatory treatment of U.S. products. The ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements, including the World Trade Organization’s General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and General Agreement on Trade and Services; however, these agreements have limited application with respect to preventing the denial of market access to audio-visual products originating outside the EU.
Privacy and Information Regulation
 The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) prohibits websites and online services from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (“CAN-SPAM”) regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails, or “spam.” The Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”) prohibits the knowing disclosure of information that identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials from a “video tape service provider.” The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) restricts marketing communications such as text and calls without explicit consent. The Company’s online services, websites and other business activities may be subject to COPPA, CAN-SPAM, VPPA and TCPA requirements and the accompanying risk of enforcement and litigation.

Federal regulators’ interest in issues of privacy, cybersecurity and data security has continued to steadily increase. On March 26, 2012, the FTC released a report on consumer privacy setting forth a detailed privacy framework and urging industry to accelerate the pace of adoption of self-regulatory measures. Since then, the FTC has released additional reports on privacy and security topics, including reports on data brokers (May 2014), Big Data (January 2016) and cross-device tracking (January 2017), and it has continued to bring enforcement actions.
 A number of privacy and data security bills have been introduced in both Houses of Congress that address the collection, maintenance and use of personal information, web browsing and geolocation data, data security and breach notification requirements and cybersecurity. Many state legislatures have already adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate on the Internet, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches, and state attorneys general have made consumer privacy and data security an enforcement focus. The industry released a set of self-regulatory online behavioral advertising principles in 2009, which have been implemented by web publishers, online advertisers and online advertising networks. These principles were extended in November 2011 to the use of online consumer data for purposes other than advertising, in July 2013 to the mobile environment and in November 2015 to cross-device tracking. It is unclear whether these and other industry self-regulatory efforts alone will address the concerns expressed by some federal and state officials about the collection of anonymous data online or via mobile applications to serve targeted content and advertising. It is not possible to predict whether proposed privacy and data security legislation will be enacted or to determine what effect such legislation might have on the Company’s business.
 Foreign governments are raising similar privacy and data security concerns. In particular, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became enforceable as of May 25, 2018. The GDPR tightens regulation of the collection, use and security of personal data and will continue to restrict the trans-border flow of such data while increasing the potential fines for non-compliance. A new e-Privacy Regulation (“e-PR”) is in negotiation in the EU that would supersede the existing EU e-Privacy (Cookie) Directive and complement the GDPR. If adopted, the new e-PR would tighten regulation regarding third party tracking tools. European industry has implemented a self-regulatory regime for online behavioral advertising that is largely consistent with the U.S. self-regulatory framework. It is unclear how compliance with the GDPR will affect the Company’s business and it is not possible to predict the measures that the e-PR, if and when enacted, will contain and the resulting impact on the Company’s business. Canada, Australia, Russia, China, Japan and other countries in South/Latin America and Asia are also strengthening their privacy laws and the enforcement of privacy and data security requirements.
 The Company monitors pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments.
 Intellectual Property
 The Company’s intellectual property assets include: copyrights in motion pictures, television programming, books and other publications, websites and technologies; trademarks in names, logos and characters; domain names; patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services; and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. The Company derives value from these assets through the theatrical release of films and the production, distribution and/or licensing of its films and television programming to domestic and international television and cable networks, pay television services, PPV, VOD services and DTH satellite services, operation of websites, and through the sale of products, such as DVDs, Blu-rays, video games, collectible merchandise, apparel, books and publications, among others.
 The Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property in the United States and other key foreign territories. To protect these assets, the Company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Policing unauthorized use of the Company’s products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Company’s intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit that threat

through a combination of approaches, including offering legitimate market alternatives, deploying digital rights management technologies, pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. Piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property.
 Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Company’s intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Therefore, the Company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement.
