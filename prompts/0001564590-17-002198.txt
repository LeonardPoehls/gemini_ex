Company Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and seeks to commercialize therapeutic antibodies with the potential to meaningfully transform current treatment paradigms.  All of our product candidates were discovered and developed by Alder scientists using our proprietary antibody technology platform coupled with a deliberate approach to design and select candidates with properties that we believe optimize the therapeutic potential for patients and commercial competitiveness. 
 We are focusing our resources and development efforts principally on eptinezumab (ALD403), our most advanced solely-owned product candidate, in order to maximize its therapeutic and commercial potential. Eptinezumab is being evaluated in a pivotal trial program for the prevention of migraine, with a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) planned for the second half of 2018. Migraine is a serious neurological disease affecting about 36 million people in the United States. Of that number, approximately 13 million adults in the U.S. are estimated to be candidates for a migraine prevention therapeutic, including three million people that live with chronic migraine, the most serious form of the disease. 
 Eptinezumab is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody inhibiting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a validated target that is understood to drive migraine initiation, maintenance and chronification. Designed to deliver a competitively differentiated approach to migraine prevention, we believe eptinezumab holds the potential to be a transformative therapeutic and meet a profound medical need, changing the migraine prevention treatment paradigm for physicians and patients living with migraine. 
 Our deliberate approach to engineering and developing eptinezumab is designed to provide a unique clinical profile that, after a single administration via an in-office infusion procedure, provides rapid and persistent migraine relief, and facilitates patient adherence.  We believe that this clinical profile, as supported by data from our clinical trials, will present a potentially compelling value proposition for patients, physicians, payors and our stakeholders.  In Phase 2 clinical trials for the prevention of migraine, eptinezumab has demonstrated robust efficacy, rapid reduction in migraine days and a persistent response. 
 The pivotal trial program for our infusion formulation of eptinezumab in support of a BLA submission consists of two Phase 3 pivotal trials and a single open-label Phase 3 clinical trial.  Our first pivotal trial, PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 1 (PROMISE 1), commenced in October 2015 and is evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab administered via infusion once every 12 weeks for one year in approximately 800 patients with frequent episodic migraine, defined as five to 14 migraine days per month.  Our second pivotal trial, PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 2 (PROMISE 2), commenced in November 2016 and is evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab administered via infusion once every 12 weeks for six months in approximately 1,050 patients with chronic migraine, defined as 15 or more migraine days per month, with features of migraine on at least eight days per month.  The open-label trial commenced in December 2016 and is evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of eptinezumab administered via infusion once every 12 weeks for one year in approximately 120 patients with chronic migraine. We expect top-line data from PROMISE 1 to be available in the first half of 2017, top-line data from PROMISE 2 to be available in the first half of 2018 and top-line data from the open-label trial to be available in the first half of 2018.  Our objective is to submit a BLA to the FDA based on the results of these three trials in the second half of 2018.

We intend to investigate opportunities to maximize the differentiated therapeutic and commercial profile of eptinezumab based on preclinical and clinical data observed to date, through the initiation of one or more additional clinical studies of our infusion formulation.  Based on the data from our eptinezumab clinical trials and feedback we have received from investigators and key opinion leaders around the clinical value of rapid onset, effectiveness and persistence of relief from our infusion formulation of eptinezumab, we believe that further studies focused on these characteristics have the potential to add value and represent the best use of our resources in the near term.  We are also committed to investigating additional routes of administration, such as a potential subcutaneous and/or intramuscular formulation.  We expect to have further insight regarding our plans and timing following the availability of top-line data from PROMISE 1, which we believe will expand our understanding of eptinezumab’s profile and potential commercial dose.
Assuming eptinezumab is approved by the FDA, we plan to focus our initial commercialization efforts on high-prescribing neurologists and headache centers in the United States employing a specialty sales force. To maximize the potential commercial opportunity of eptinezumab while we focus on the U.S. specialty market, we may explore strategic arrangements that provide additional capabilities and infrastructure, while improving access for physicians and patients. We also intend to seek approval for eptinezumab in the European Union and other jurisdictions outside the United States.
 Our product candidate pipeline also includes ALD1910, a preclinical wholly-owned monoclonal antibody that targets pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38). ALD1910 is undergoing investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies for the prevention of migraine. PACAP-38 is a protein that is active in mediating the initiation of migraine, and we believe that ALD1910 holds potential as a treatment for migraineurs who have an inadequate response to therapeutics directed at CGRP or its receptor. Our third pipeline candidate is clazakizumab, designed to block the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. In May 2016, we licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to clazakizumab to Vitaeris, Inc., or Vitaeris, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that will pursue innovative therapeutic indications in chronic inflammatory diseases. Prior to the license to Vitaeris, clazakizumab completed two positive Phase 2b clinical trials establishing proof-of-concept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 
 Our Strategic Priorities 
 Our goal is to build an enduring biopharmaceutical company that discovers and selects monoclonal antibodies for development and commercialization that hold the potential to meaningfully transform current treatment paradigms and offer patients innovative therapies in indications with profound medical needs. Key strategic priorities for us to achieve that goal include: 

• | Continue to prioritize the clinical development activities of eptinezumab for the prevention of migraine. Our primary priority is continuing to efficiently progress the clinical development of eptinezumab as a preventative treatment for migraine, supporting our objective of regulatory approval of eptinezumab at the earliest opportunity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance the value of eptinezumab by maximizing its differentiating properties and clinical profile. We may explore the initiation of one or more additional clinical trials of our infusion formulation to maximize the differentiated therapeutic and commercial profile of eptinezumab. We are also committed to investigating additional routes of administration, such as a potential subcutaneous and/or intramuscular formulation. We expect to have further insight regarding our plans and timing following the availability of top-line data from PROMISE 1, which we believe will expand our understanding of eptinezumab’s profile and likely commercial dose. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimize the commercial potential of eptinezumab by independently commercializing it for the prevention of migraine in the United States. We intend to continue commercial readiness activities to support independent commercialization of eptinezumab in the United States as a migraine prevention therapy, subject to FDA approval. We initially plan to build a specialty sales force targeting high-prescribing neurologists and headache centers in the United States. To maximize the potential commercial opportunity of eptinezumab while we focus on the U.S. specialty market, we may explore strategic arrangements that provide additional capabilities and infrastructure, while improving access for physicians and patients. We also intend to seek approval for eptinezumab in the European Union and other jurisdictions outside the United States. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Progress the development of ALD1910 as an additional treatment option for migraine prevention. In 2016, we designated ALD1910 as a candidate to advance to IND-enabling studies for the prevention of migraine. We believe that ALD1910 holds potential as a treatment for migraineurs who have an inadequate response to therapeutics directed at CGRP or its receptor and plan to advance ALD1910 through IND-enabling toxicology studies to support an IND with the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our proprietary antibody technology platform and deliberate design approach. We have brought together a group of world class scientists and drug developers that, when coupled with our proprietary technologies, allow us to discover, develop and commercialize antibody-based therapeutics that have the potential to change the lives of patients suffering from many types of disease. We intend to establish targeted commercialization and marketing capabilities for our products in the United States, and to discover and select candidates addressing areas of profound medical need and hold properties that we believe optimize the therapeutic potential for patients and commercial competitiveness.

Our Pipeline
 Our product candidate pipeline is composed of candidates discovered and developed by Alder scientists using our proprietary antibody technology platform and a deliberate approach to design and select candidates to have properties that we believe optimize the therapeutic potential for patients and commercial competitiveness. Leveraging this platform, we select for antibody properties that we consider important in order to optimize safety, tolerability and efficacy, along with other properties that support reduced dosing volumes and frequency, time to onset of therapeutic effect, route of administration flexibility and other benefits. 
 We direct our pipeline efforts to treat central nervous system (CNS) diseases and pain where we believe there is a profound medical need and where a monoclonal antibody can offer an innovative and a best-in-class or first-in-class therapeutic option conveying safety and efficacy advantages compared to existing therapies.  Our pipeline currently includes three internally discovered humanized monoclonal antibodies, as well as preclinical programs targeting additional indications that are in the discovery phase. 
 Eptinezumab

 Overview
 Eptinezumab, our most advanced solely owned product candidate, is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody that inhibits CGRP for prevention of migraine. CGRP is a small protein and a validated biological target that is understood to drive migraine initiation, maintenance and chronification. Eptinezumab was discovered by Alder scientists and is the result of a deliberate process coupled with proprietary technologies to design a monoclonal antibody inhibiting CGRP that delivers a competitively differentiated profile and a unique clinical benefit to patients. We believe eptinezumab holds the potential to be a transformative therapeutic and meet a profound medical need, changing the migraine prevention treatment paradigm for physicians and patients living with migraine. 
 Eptinezumab is the subject of a pivotal trial program and has been successfully evaluated in multiple clinical trials, including two Phase 2 clinical trials. Our clinical data to date demonstrates that, after a single administration via an in-office infusion procedure, eptinezumab provided rapid and persistent migraine relief. As an infusion procedure, we believe eptinezumab will provide the opportunity for appropriate patient monitoring, facilitate proper administration of product and ensure patient adherence.  In Phase 2 clinical trials for the prevention of migraine, eptinezumab has demonstrated:
  
1. | Robust efficacy: three months after a single administration, approximately one-third of patients with either frequent episodic or chronic migraine had a 75% reduction in migraine days and over half of patients had a 50% reduction in migraine days.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Rapid reduction in migraine days: preliminary data from our Phase 2b clinical trial in chronic migraine suggested a separation of eptinezumab from placebo occurred within 48 hours of administration. Further, significant separation from placebo was also observed at 4 weeks post-dose in both frequent episodic and chronic migraine patients. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | A persistent response: efficacy data supports a quarterly dosing regimen and possibly less frequent dosing regimen in a subset of patients.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that the emerging profile of eptinezumab, with its potential to rapidly and significantly reduce the number of migraine days that patients experience after a single administration that persists for three months, including the potential to make a subset of patients 75% and 100% migraine free during the course of our completed Phase 2 clinical trials, addresses key therapeutic needs of patients and physicians and compete favorably with existing treatments and other treatments currently in development. In addition to its favorable emerging safety and efficacy profile, we believe eptinezumab has the potential for advantageous dosing regimens requiring infusions no more often than quarterly.
  About Migraine
 Migraine is a serious neurological disease; approximately 36 million Americans live with migraine. Migraine is the sixth most debilitating disease globally. In the United States, employers lose more than $13 billion each year as a result of 113 million lost work days due to migraine. Migraine is also a significant cause of emergency rooms visits, with estimates reaching over 1 million visits annually. 
 Migraine is a multifaceted disease associated with a complex interplay between genetics and the environment that results in a hyper-excitable nervous system. Migraine symptoms typically include sharp or throbbing head pain along with associated aura, such as disturbed vision, sensitivity to light, sound and smells, nausea and vomiting, mood changes and cognitive difficulties. Migraine starts as an episodic disorder but becomes chronic over time as the threshold for migraine initiation is reduced, resulting in an increased frequency of migraine attacks and little or no return to normal baseline nervous system function between episodes.
 Migraine is three times more common in women than men, affecting 30% of women over a lifetime. Migraine is most common between the ages of 20 and 50 in both men and women. Migraine severity is divided into low frequency, frequent episodic and chronic. Low frequency migraine is characterized as zero to four migraine days per month, frequent episodic migraine as five to 14 migraine days per month, and chronic migraine as 15 or more headache days per month, with features of migraine on at least 8 days per month.
 Of the 36 million people in the United States living with migraine, it is estimated that approximately 13 million are candidates for a preventative therapy, including three million with chronic migraine, representing the most disabled segment of the migraine 
 5


patient population. We estimate the annual market opportunity for the three million patients living with chronic migraine is estimated to be $4 billion.
 Current Therapies.  Currently, pharmacological treatment for migraine can be divided into abortive and preventive therapy. Abortive medications aim to reverse, or at least stop, the progression of a migraine once it has started. Preventive medications, which are given even in the absence of a migraine, aim to reduce the frequency and severity of the migraine attack, make acute attacks more responsive to abortive medications and may improve the patient’s quality of life to a greater degree than abortive medications alone.   
 With some limitations and exceptions, FDA approved abortive medications are used successfully by many patients. However, for those patients living with migraine that are candidates for a preventative therapy, available treatments have limited efficacy, poor tolerability, or serious side-effects (or a combination of these) that limit patient use. Specifically, we believe that there is a need for migraine prevention therapies with improved safety, efficacy and route of administration options to meet patient and physician needs. Both patients and physicians seek treatment options that significantly reduce the number of migraine days patients experience and are safe and well-tolerated. Additionally, how quickly the treatment prevents migraines is of particular importance to patients. Providing dosing options that provide for infrequent quarterly dosing are also important to physicians and patients to improve convenience and medical compliance.
  
• | Abortive Medications. Numerous abortive medications are used for migraine. The choice for an individual patient depends on the severity of the attacks, associated symptoms, such as severity of pain, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and the patient’s treatment response. Patients most commonly use a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a 5-hydroxytryptamine–1 agonist, or triptan, or a combination of both to abort a migraine. Triptans are most effective when taken early during a migraine and may be repeated in two hours as needed, with a maximum of two doses daily. Triptans are not recommended for use more than three days a week because overuse can lead to increased frequency of migraines and medication overuse headache. Approximately 30% to 50% of patients respond to triptans and there is a high rate of recurrence of migraine within 24 hours. To avoid the development of medication overuse headache, patients are limited to no more than 10 doses of triptans in any one month, which may be insufficient to treat patients with frequent episodic or chronic migraines. This limitation can also be problematic for migraine patients who suffer from nausea and vomiting and cannot keep triptans in their systems. In addition to these limitations, triptans are also contraindicated for patients with existing, or at risk of, coronary artery disease.

• | Preventive Medications. Currently, preventive medications approved for migraine include beta blockers (such as propranolol), topiramate, sodium valproate, and botulinum toxin, or Botox. In patients with frequent episodic and chronic migraine, beta blockers, topiramate and sodium valproate are commonly used. These medications are often not well-tolerated by patients because of adverse events such as cognitive impairment, nausea, fatigue and sleep disturbance. In clinical trials, complete responses, or a 100% reduction in migraine days or episodes, with topiramate were less than 6%. In the affected patient population, predominantly women of child-bearing age, the association of these agents with poor pregnancy outcomes and fetal abnormalities can limit their use.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Botox is only approved in chronic migraine patients. Approximately 47% of Botox-treated patients experience a 50% reduction in either migraine days per month or migraine frequency per month within six months, which leaves more than half of patients inadequately treated. In Phase 3 clinical trials, Botox did not report any complete responses. In addition, the dosing regimen requires approximately 31 subcutaneous injections at various sites on the head and neck which is repeated every 12 weeks if the patient has a therapeutic response. 
 Profound Unmet Medical Need.  The utility of current preventative treatment options is challenged by limited efficacy and medication side-effects which often limit the use of migraine medications. According to the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, only about 12% of adults with frequent episodic or chronic migraine take preventive medications. Further, nearly 50% of migraineurs have not used a preventative therapy and 65% discontinue migraine medication because of side effects. As a result, we believe the area of profound unmet need in migraine is for preventive therapies with improved efficacy and tolerability to treat the individuals with frequent episodic and chronic migraine. 
 Indications for preventive migraine medications may include: 
  
• | frequency of migraine attacks greater than two per month with disability that lasts three or more days per month;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | abortive medications fail or are overused; or
--+----------------------------------------------


• | symptomatic medications (e.g. analgesics or anti-emetics) are contraindicated or ineffective.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Approximately 50% of prevention candidates are treated by neurologists. We believe these patients are highly motivated to seek new preventative treatment options that offer improved safety and tolerability, and better efficacy as measured by a material reduction in the number of migraine days experienced, the rapidity with which the migraines are prevented, and infrequent dosing, as compared with current options, which have safety, tolerability and efficacy limitations. We believe that a therapeutic option that addresses these 
 6


limitations represents a significant opportunity to improve disease management in a substantial number of patients that are candidates for migraine prevention. 
 Our Migraine Prevention Solution: CGRP and the Science of Eptinezumab.  We are developing eptinezumab for the prevention of migraine, to meet the needs of the estimated 13 million patients in the United States living with migraine that are candidates for a preventative therapy option. Eptinezumab is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody that inhibits CGRP, a small protein and a validated biological target that is understood to drive migraine initiation, maintenance and chronification. Eptinezumab was discovered by Alder scientists and is the result of a deliberate process coupled with proprietary technologies to design a monoclonal antibody inhibiting CGRP. It was designed to provide a competitively differentiated clinical profile to the migraine prevention treatment paradigm and deliver a unique clinical benefit to patients. 
 We believe eptinezumab holds the potential to be a transformative therapeutic and meet a profound medical need, changing the migraine prevention treatment paradigm for physicians and patients living with frequent episodic or chronic migraine. We are developing eptinezumab as a highly potent, long-acting therapeutic that modulates the activity of CGRP for the prevention of migraine in patients with frequent episodic or chronic migraine.
 Other CGRP Directed Therapeutics.  There are no currently approved medications that directly target CGRP. Small molecule CGRP inhibitors, such as Merck’s telcagepant, established that blocking CGRP was effective as an abortive treatment for migraine. However, these small molecules, which have very different properties than eptinezumab, a monoclonal antibody, had side-effects and toxicity issues that curtailed their development. The Merck experience further clinically validated CGRP biology as a target for migraine but suggested a different strategy for intervention to be used to avoid off-target toxicity issues. Based on prior experiences of other companies targeting the CGRP pathway and our own efficacy data in the prevention of frequent episodic migraine and chronic migraine, we believe there is compelling rationale to continue the development of a highly selective antibody, such as eptinezumab, for the prevention of migraine. In clinical trials of eptinezumab to date, involving more than 1,500 subjects, we have not observed any significant side-effects or toxicity issues.  As described under “—Competition—Eptinezumab,” there are several other CGRP inhibiting therapies currently in development that could compete with eptinezumab.
Commercial Strategy 
 In the United States, due to the severity of the disease, patients with frequent episodic or chronic migraine typically seek preventive treatment from neurologists and pain specialists. It is estimated that approximately 50% of the candidates for migraine prevention in the United States are cared for by neurologists, including the estimated three million patients with chronic migraine. By the time a frequent episodic or chronic migraine patient begins prevention therapy, the patient may have experienced any or all of:  increased headache frequency; loss of response to abortive therapy; and significant migraine-related disability. Neurologists prescribe preventive therapies more often than do primary care physicians and pain specialists across all headache frequencies.  Given the referral patterns for migraine and the need for improved patient care, the American Migraine Foundation has initiated a program to establish headache centers in major cities across the United States. We plan to build a specialty sales force targeting the high-prescribing neurologists and headache centers in the United States, if eptinezumab is approved, and to seek one or more partners to commercialize eptinezumab outside the United States. 
 We intend to commercialize an infusion formulation and are investigating additional routes of administration, such as a potential subcutaneous and/or intramuscular formulation.  We expect to have further insight regarding our plans and timing following the availability of top-line data from PROMISE 1, which we believe will expand our understanding of eptinezumab’s profile and potential commercial dose.
 Infusion procedures are known to neurologists for the treatment of migraines specifically and a range of other neurological disorders with the objective of administration of fast, persistent, therapeutic benefit to patients.  Our research supports that 70% of neurologists have access to IV delivery infrastructure, including infusion centers.  Infusions have the benefit of being a procedure in the physician’s office or a clinic setting, which our research supports a large segment of physicians and patients prefer to self-treating at home by self- injection.  Procedures such as infusion administered in a physician office also address patient adherence issues which are one of the leading causes of lack of benefit from currently available oral therapies.  
Overview. We believe the clinical data obtained to date in our development program for eptinezumab exhibits the potential of eptinezumab to transform the preventative treatment of patients with migraine. We have completed multiple clinical trials evaluating eptinezumab, including two Phase 2 trials in patients living with migraine, and are currently evaluating eptinezumab in a pivotal trial program that encompasses two Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials and an open-label Phase 3 clinical trial. Further, we are exploring the initiation of one or more additional clinical studies of our infusion formulation that would, if successful, potentially enable us to broaden the initial label beyond that contemplated by our existing pivotal trials.  We are also committed to investigating additional routes of administration, such as a potential subcutaneous and/or intramuscular formulation.  We plan to have discussions with the FDA in 2017 regarding any additional clinical requirements for our expected commercial supply of eptinezumab in support of our initial BLA submission.

For purposes of the clinical trial descriptions which follow below, the references to “p” values mean statistical calculations to determine whether the effects of eptinezumab were significant in comparison to placebo based on pre-specified statistical targets. We specified that any result where “p” was less than or equal to 0.05 would be statistically significant.
 
Pivotal Trial Program.  We initiated our pivotal trial program for eptinezumab in October 2015 with PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 1 (PROMISE 1), a pivotal clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab administered via infusion once every 12 weeks for one year in approximately 800 patients with frequent episodic migraine.  PROMISE 1 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial in which patients are randomized equally to either one of three doses of eptinezumab or placebo administered via infusion once every 12 weeks across sites in the United States and Europe.  Patient recruitment for PROMISE 1 was completed in October 2016, and we expect top-line data from PROMISE 1 to be available in the first half of 2017. Also in October 2016, we met with the FDA regarding our eptinezumab pivotal clinical trial program.  Based on input from the FDA, we finalized the design of our pivotal clinical trial program in support of a BLA submission, and in November 2016 initiated a second pivotal clinical trial, PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 2 (PROMISE 2), evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab in patients with chronic migraine. The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial enrolling approximately 1,050 patients randomized to either one of two dose levels of eptinezumab or placebo administered via infusion once every 12 weeks for six months across sites in the United States and Europe.  The primary endpoint of both pivotal trials is the mean reduction in migraine days from baseline over weeks 1 to 12.  Key secondary endpoints are the 75% responder rate over weeks 1 to 12 as determined by the change in migraine days between eptinezumab and placebo, and the 75% responder rate over weeks 1 to 4 as determined by the change in migraine days between eptinezumab and placebo.  We expect top-line data from PROMISE 2 to be available in the first half of 2018.
 In December 2016, we initiated an open-label Phase 3 clinical trial of eptinezumab to further confirm the long-term safety and tolerability of eptinezumab, as required by the FDA. This study is a Phase 3 clinical trial enrolling 120 patients receiving eptinezumab administered by infusion once every 12 weeks for one year.  We expect data from this clinical trial to be available in the first half of 2018.  
 
Completed Phase 2b Clinical Trial (Chronic Migraine). This Phase 2b clinical trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single intravenous infusion, dose ranging study in 588 patients with chronic migraine. Patients were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg or 300 mg of eptinezumab or placebo (approximately 120 patients per group). The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the change in migraine days between eptinezumab and placebo as determined by the 75% responder rates over a 12-week period.  Endpoints were also evaluated at week 24 and at week 48 (study end).  In March 2016, we announced the following positive top-line data from the trial:

• | The 300 mg and 100 mg dose levels of eptinezumab met the primary efficacy endpoint of the study, a 75% reduction in migraine days over the entire 12 weeks in 33% and 31% of patients, respectively (p < 0.05), as described in the table below:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*(p= < 0.05)   **(p= < 0.01) 
  
• | A single administration of eptinezumab resulted in an immediate and persistent mean reduction in migraine days from baseline throughout the 12 weeks at the 300 mg (p < 0.01), 100 mg (p < 0.01), and 30 mg (p < 0.01) dose levels, meeting the secondary efficacy endpoint.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | A single administration of eptinezumab at 300 mg, 100 mg or 30 mg dose levels demonstrated a persistent reduction in migraine days for the entire 12 weeks, supporting a quarterly dosing strategy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The 10 mg dose of eptinezumab was identified as sub-therapeutic.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | The safety profile was consistent with that observed in earlier eptinezumab clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In July 2016, we announced that top-line 24-week data from this trial demonstrated persistent migraine prevention in patients with chronic migraine, confirming and extending the 12-week data announced in March 2016. The 75% responder rate for the entire 24 weeks at the 300 mg, 100 mg and 30 mg dose levels was 31%, 29% and 30%, respectively, compared to a placebo rate of 20%. Eptinezumab also demonstrated a persistent mean reduction in migraine days from baseline throughout the 24-week period.  The 48-week data suggest that a subset of patients continued to receive a benefit out to 48 weeks after a single administration.  The statistical analysis plan for the Phase 2b trial does not provide for analyses of statistical significance at time points post the primary endpoint at 12 weeks. 
 A post-hoc analysis of the data demonstrated that within 48 hours after eptinezumab administration there was more than a 50% reduction in the percentage of patients experiencing migraine after receiving eptinezumab versus baseline, compared to a 17% reduction in patients administered placebo, as demonstrated in the figure below.  Further studies will need to be undertaken to confirm these findings.

An analysis of the data also demonstrated that this rapid reduction in migraine days and significant separation between those patients receiving eptinezumab versus placebo was maintained at four weeks after administration, as demonstrated in the table below:

Completed Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Clinical Trial (Frequent Episodic Migraine).  Our first completed Phase 2 clinical trial of eptinezumab was a single intravenous infusion dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized proof-of-concept trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of eptinezumab in patients with frequent episodic migraine. Pharmacokinetics measures the amount of a specific drug in the body over a period of time, and includes the process of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the drug. Approximately 80 patients each received one dose of eptinezumab in the clinical trial. 
 Differences in the change in mean migraine days per month was the approvable endpoint for the pivotal clinical trials of Botox, which has been approved for prevention of chronic migraine. The primary endpoint for our proof-of-concept trial was the difference between eptinezumab and placebo in the change of mean migraine days per month from baseline to weeks five through eight following one dose of eptinezumab. As illustrated in the figure below, in the trial, one dose of eptinezumab produced a rapid and persistent reduction in migraine days that was statistically significant when compared to placebo, in terms of both change in migraine days per month (p=0.03) and the magnitude of the change in migraine days prevented across all patients (p<0.001) at the primary endpoint of eight weeks. The reduction in migraine days per month was also statistically significant across the entire combined three-month trial period (p=0.0078). 
 Eptinezumab 1000 mg IV versus Placebo IV as a Single Dose 
 
In addition to reduction of mean migraine days per month as an efficacy endpoint, a responder analysis was performed. As illustrated in the table below, 16% of patients receiving a single dose of eptinezumab achieved a complete 100% response (zero migraine days) versus 0% on placebo over the entire 12-week period following infusion. In any four-week period of the trial (weeks 1-4, 5-8 or 9-12), approximately 75% of patients achieved a 50% reduction, 45% or more achieved a 75% reduction and 27% or more achieved a 100% reduction in migraine days. We believe measuring response rates, or the magnitude of the change in migraine days 
 10


prevented across patients, provides an important measure of patient benefit to prescribing physicians and patients. For example, telling a patient that he or she has a one in six chance of achieving a complete response, meaning no migraines, can be easier to relate to than reduction of mean migraine days per month. 
 

 
Number (Percentage) of Patients Achieving a 50%, 75% and 100% Reduction in Migraine Days During Weeks 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12
Time Period | Percent Reduction Migraine Days | Placebo IV | Eptinezumab 1000 mg IV | p-value
Weeks 1-4 | Number of Evaluable Patients | 80 | 76 | 
50% | 40 (50.0) | 57 (75.0) | p=0.0011 
75% | 19 (23.8) | 39 (51.3) | p=0.0003 
100% | 4 (5.0) | 21 (27.6) | p<0.0001 
Weeks 5-8 | Number of Evaluable Patients | 80 | 78 | 
50% | 43 (53.8) | 59 (75.6) | p=0.0032 
75% | 28 (35.0) | 35 (44.9) | p=0.1347 
100% | 12 (15.0) | 21 (26.9) | p=0.0493 
Weeks 9-12 | Number of Evaluable Patients | 78 | 73 | 
50% | 52 (66.7) | 55 (75.3) | p=0.1603 
75% | 24 (30.8) | 39 (53.4) | p=0.0039 
100% | 13 (16.7) | 30 (41.1) | p=0.0008 
Weeks 1-12 | Number of Evaluable Patients | 76 | 68 | 
50% | 25 (32.9) | 41 (60.3) | p=0.0006 
75% | 7 (9.2) | 22 (32.4) | p=0.0004 
100% | 0 | 11 (16.2) | p=0.0001 

 
The following figure presents data from patients who achieved a 50%, 75% and 100% reduction in migraines at all-time points in the trial. Eptinezumab provided a statistically significant reduction versus placebo in migraines at all response levels in these patients (p<0.001). 
 
Eptinezumab was well-tolerated and adverse events were comparable in terms of type and frequency across eptinezumab and placebo groups. In addition, there were no meaningful differences between the eptinezumab treatment and placebo groups with respect to adverse events, cardiovascular measures or laboratory safety data.

Patients in this trial were followed for an additional three months for a total of six months (24 weeks) follow-up. The percentage of patients achieving a 50, 75 or 100% response for the entire 24-week duration of follow-up was similar to that observed for the first 12 weeks, suggesting that the response to a single dose of eptinezumab was persistent and long lasting. 
 
Reduction in Migraine Days for Three and Six Months is Similar 
 

Phase 1 Clinical Trials.  We have completed various Phase 1 clinical trials of eptinezumab, including a Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrating that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics by infusion, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of eptinezumab support a quarterly single injection dosing strategy. 
 Safety Profile. The observed serious adverse events, or SAEs, across all clinical trials to date for eptinezumab include, among others, inguinal hernia, kidney infection, transient ischemic attack, which is a precursor to stroke, conversion disorder, which is a mental health condition in which a person has blindness, paralysis, or other nervous system symptoms that cannot be explained by medical evaluation, chest pain, shortness of breath and wound infection. However, the relevant clinical investigators concluded that all observed SAEs to date were found to be unrelated to eptinezumab. We have observed some injection-site reactions, or ISRs, in Phase 1 clinical trials of subcutaneous and intramuscular injections of eptinezumab.  Additional studies or requirements from the FDA for future studies may be necessary to address these ISRs.
 
ALD1910
 ALD1910 is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody discovered and designed by Alder to specifically inhibit pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide-38, or PACAP-38, a protein active in mediating the initiation of migraine. We believe ALD1910 holds potential as a migraine prevention treatment for those who have an inadequate response to therapeutics directed at CGRP, and could provide an important new therapeutic option to migraine patients and their physicians.
 ALD1910 is currently undergoing IND enabling preclinical studies. Similar to our other internally developed product candidates, ALD1910 is designed to have favorable antibody properties and a desirable product profile we consider critical to a streamlined development path.
 
Clazakizumab 
 Clazakizumab is a novel monoclonal antibody that inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), an important driver of the inflammatory response. IL-6 is also implicated in the transition from acute to chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is a notable feature of several diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis. Clazakizumab completed two positive Phase 2b clinical studies establishing proof-of-concept for RA.
 In May 2016, Alder licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to clazakizumab to Vitaeris. which will pursue innovative therapeutic indications in chronic inflammatory diseases. In exchange for the rights to clazakizumab, Alder has received an equity stake in Vitaeris and is eligible to receive royalties and certain other payments.

Preclinical Pipeline 
 We are actively working to expand our antibody therapeutic pipeline in opportunities where our technology provides favorable development advantage in areas of unmet medical need, seeking both first-in-class and best-in-class therapeutics. We prioritize targets that meet the criteria of either genetic validation or clinical demonstration that they play a central role in the disease state. We are continuing to evaluate additional potential candidates that represent diverse opportunities in indications that may be eligible for orphan designations and/or indications where monoclonal antibodies have not previously played a role in the treatment paradigm, such as was the case with our eptinezumab program for migraine prevention. 
Technology Platform 
 We built and use a proprietary antibody platform to discover and develop monoclonal antibody therapeutics that enables us to engineer our candidates to have properties that we believe optimize the therapeutic potential for patients. Since the unique structure, including sequence, of an antibody determines how it functions and behaves, we specifically engineer our candidates to have properties aligned with the desired therapeutic profile. Leveraging this proprietary platform, we select for properties that we consider important in order to optimize safety, tolerability and efficacy. We further select for properties that support reduced dosing volumes and frequency, time to onset of therapeutic effect, route of administration flexibility, reduced immunogenicity compared to other monoclonal antibody therapeutics, and other benefits. The specific monoclonal antibody properties that we consider important to optimize in the selection and development of our candidates to support best-in-class target therapeutic profiles include:

• | Bioavailability
--+----------------


• | Binding affinity and specificity
--+---------------------------------


• | Half-life
--+----------


• | Immunogenicity
--+---------------


• | Manufacturing efficiency
--+-------------------------


• | Formulation properties
--+-----------------------

 Our proprietary platform consists of three components that we believe together allows us to optimize the discovery and selection of monoclonal antibody product candidates with the specific, pre-defined, properties that confer best-in-class therapeutic potential for patients:
  
• | Antibody selection (ABS): our proprietary antibody selection platform that provides access to diverse antibody collections that meet our therapeutic target profile and provides access to optimal properties of high affinity and selectivity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A pioneering process we developed that humanizes rabbit antibodies to produce therapeutic antibodies that are greater than 95% human. Unlike fully-human antibodies, our antibodies are designed to lack certain sugars in an effort to minimize the body’s recognition of such antibodies as foreign, thereby limiting infusion reactions as well as maximizing durability of the therapeutic response.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our yeast-based proprietary manufacturing technology, MabXpress.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 We also believe these technologies allow us to address a number of critical development priorities early, thereby reducing our development cost and timeline. 
 
Antibody Discovery and Candidate Selection Technology 
 Antibodies are produced by the immune system in humans and other warm-blooded animals. They are naturally generated to help defend and protect from disease and infections. Antibodies are produced and secreted by specialized antibody producing cells called B cells. Traditionally, rodents have been used as the source of therapeutic antibodies. To find these antibodies, we remove the B cells from the spleen and fuse to a cancer cell. The combined cancer and B cell, or “hybridoma,” is able to live longer from this host than normal B cells would alone. Generally, this process has trouble recovering an antibody with the desired properties due to its low overall efficiency. Collectively, this limits the ability to identify high-quality antibody therapeutics with optimal therapeutic properties. 
 We discover all of our product candidates in-house with our ABS technology. As a precursor to discovery, we choose to target freely-circulating proteins, such as ligands, which are critical to the disease biology and are part of well understood disease pathways. We believe this strategy can lead to fewer drug doses at lower concentrations, while potentially minimizing off target activity and associated side-effects. The clinical relevance of these proteins is highly validated by prior scientific or clinical research. 
 Our ABS technology has been successfully applied to a wide cross section of therapeutic targets that range from small biologically active peptides to more traditional monoclonal antibody targets. ABS allows us to rapidly evaluate all the B cells in a host and identify the key subset of cells that produce the antibody responsible for the desired therapeutic effect. We believe one of our competitive advantages is our proprietary method to keep these B cells alive while we exhaustively screen them. This is an iterative 
 13


process that allows us to identify the rare antibodies that possess the ideal qualities needed to be a successful therapeutic, for example manufacturability, therapeutic stability, durability and favorable safety. 
 Our Antibody Selection Process 
 
Our ABS technology has been applied in all our preclinical and clinical programs and led to the selection of our most advanced product candidate, eptinezumab, as well as ALD1910 and clazakizumab. We also use our ABS technology to provide bio-analytical support for all our product candidates in the clinic. 
Antibody Humanization and Therapeutic Design 
 Antibodies derived from non-human sources elicit a natural rejection response, and if left unchanged when injected into humans, are removed rapidly and quickly lose their therapeutic effect. Common sources of antibodies include mice and rats, which have antibodies that are structurally different from humans and need to be altered to be more human-like. 
 Historically, this is a complex and difficult undertaking to convert rodent antibodies into human therapeutics that retain all the original rodent antibody properties. This is a highly iterative process that is both time and labor intensive and is fraught with significant failure. 
 We have pioneered the use of rabbit antibodies as the starting materials for our product candidates. Compared to rodent antibody humanization, our rabbit antibody humanization results in more human-like antibodies that maintain their original properties and are faster to produce. As a result, our process requires fewer iterations to complete humanization. Using our proprietary technology, we consistently generate antibody therapeutics that are greater than 95% human in terms of their sequence content. However, unlike fully-human antibodies, we specifically design our antibodies to lack certain sugars in order to further minimize the body’s recognition of such antibodies as foreign, thereby limiting infusion reactions, as well as maximizing durability of the therapeutic response. Our technology results in product candidates that are well-tolerated by patients. 
 Our product candidates are also differentiated from most other monoclonal antibodies based on our use of an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) backbone. While all therapeutic antibodies use an immunoglobulin backbone, there are four different IgG subclasses. We believe that the use of IgG1, in combination with our decision to engineer our antibodies to remove certain sugars from the backbone, improves certain therapeutic characteristics, including reduced immunogenicity and improved half-life.
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success will significantly depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our product candidates and antibody platform. For the specific antibody product candidates in all of our programs, we seek to protect the candidate antibody and variants thereof, compositions containing the antibody, methods of manufacturing the antibody, and the use of the antibody in treating human disease conditions where we or any future partner is actively pursuing, or contemplate pursuing regulatory approval permitting the marketing of the antibody for use as a human 
 14


therapeutic agent. In addition to pursuing patent protection for our key technologies, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. 
 We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to protect competitive advantages. For more information, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”

Technology Licenses 
 Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences 
 In October 2004, we entered into a royalty-free license agreement with Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences, or Keck, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to Keck’s patent rights in certain inventions, or the Keck patent rights, and technology or the Keck technology, related to production and optimization of antibodies in yeast, including certain patents relating to our ABS and MabXpress technologies. Under the license agreement, we are permitted to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products using the Keck patent rights for all research and commercial uses, and to sublicense such rights. Keck retained the right, on behalf of itself and other non-profit institutions, to use the Keck patent rights and Keck technology for educational and research purposes and to publish information about the Keck patent rights and to further use the Keck technology for purposes other than production and optimization of antibodies in yeast. 
  In consideration for the rights granted to us under the license agreement, we issued Keck an aggregate of 40,000 shares of our common stock. As additional consideration, we are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee during the term of the agreement. 
 The license agreement requires that we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one or more products that are covered by the Keck patent rights. We may terminate the license agreement upon 30 days’ notice to Keck. Either party may terminate the license agreement in the event of material breach of the license agreement which remains uncured after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach. Absent early termination, the license agreement will automatically terminate on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration date of the longest-lived patent right included in the Keck patent rights. 
 Other 
 We also license intellectual property from certain other parties that we believe to be useful for the conduct of our business and may enter into additional license agreements in the future. 
Information about Segments and Geographic Revenue
 Information about segments and geographic revenue is set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 Manufacturing 
 We have adopted a manufacturing strategy of contracting with a variety of contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, within North America and Europe for the manufacture of eptinezumab, ALD1910, and future product candidates. This has enabled us to produce products under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, controls for our completed and planned clinical trials. A protocol of methods has been established at these manufacturers along with specific testing facilities to generate sufficient information to inform the appropriate regulatory authorities. We anticipate there will be continued interaction with additional CMOs as our product candidates advance and we seek to expand our access to larger production facilities to supply clinical trials and commercialization. We currently rely on a single CMO to manufacture and provide us with clinical supplies of eptinezumab.  We have entered into agreements with two other CMOs in anticipation of larger scale commercial production, and will use eptinezumab produced by these CMOs in future clinical studies.  We expect to enter into agreements with additional CMOs in the future.  We plan to have discussions with the FDA in 2017 regarding any additional clinical requirements for our expected commercial supply of eptinezumab in support of our initial BLA submission.
Competition 
 The development and commercialization of new therapeutic products is highly competitive. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage products that are safer, more efficacious and/or more cost-effective than alternative therapies. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of biosimilar products, which are expected to become 
 16


available over the coming years. Many of our competitors are large pharmaceutical companies that will have a greater ability to reduce prices for their competing drugs in an effort to gain market share and undermine the value proposition that we might otherwise be able to offer to payors. 
 Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Many of these competitors are attempting to develop therapeutics for our target indications. 
 Eptinezumab, if approved, will compete with beta blockers that are approved for prevention of frequent episodic and chronic migraine such as propranolol, marketed by Wyeth, and other treatments such as topiramate, marketed by Johnson & Johnson, and sodium valproate, marketed by Divalproex. In addition, Botox, marketed by Allergan, is approved for the prevention of chronic migraine and commonly prescribed for frequent episodic migraine. We are also aware of several CGRP inhibiting therapies currently in development that could compete with eptinezumab, including Amgen’s AMG-334, Lilly’s LY-2951742 and Teva’s TEV-48125, all of which are therapies using antibodies similar to eptinezumab.  Amgen and Teva have each announced that they plan to make BLA submissions in 2017 for their competing CGRP therapies, which, if approved, would enable them to commercialize their CGRP therapies before we are able to do so with eptinezumab. Furthermore, even if the class of CGRP inhibiting therapies receive regulatory approval and are determined to be more effective in treating high-frequency and chronic migraine, patients may be satisfied using cheaper generic abortive medications such as triptans, which could limit eptinezumab market penetration in the migraine prevention marketplace. 
 The commercial opportunity for eptinezumab or our other product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than our product candidates or any other product candidate that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payers seek to encourage the use of generic products. 
 We believe that eptinezumab has potential benefits over competitive products as described under “—Our Pipeline.” As a result, we believe that eptinezumab should be well placed to capture market share from competing products if approved. However, even with those benefits, eptinezumab may be unable to compete successfully against these products. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to eptinezumab and Our Other Product Candidates.” 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of biopharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. 
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | submission of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities for their compliance with cGMP and selected clinical investigations for their compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA approval of a BLA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Furthermore, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board, which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may recommend that the sponsor halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. 
 17


 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
  
• | Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—Studies are conducted with groups of patients with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4—The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 BLA Submission and Review by the FDA 
 The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of BLA. The submission of BLA requires payment of a substantial User Fee to the FDA. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Once the BLA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA typically takes one year from submission to review the application and respond to the applicant, which can take the form of either a Complete Response Letter or Approval. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. FDA approval of any BLA submitted by us will be at a time the FDA chooses. Also, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use. 
 18


Healthcare Regulation 
 Our sales, promotion, medical education and other activities following product approval, and certain activities prior to approval, are and will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Our current and future business activities, including our future promotional and scientific/educational programs, may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, patient data privacy and security, and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. 
 Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, integrity obligations, the curtailment of our operations, diminished profits or future earnings, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of pharmaceutical products, when and if approved for marketing, depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, and significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Health Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA.  Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our business are: an annual fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; an expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program.  However, in January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017 that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included the Budget Control Act of 2011, which caused aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013 which, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional

Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
 There has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices.  Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.  Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 
 In the European Union, or EU, member states require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial. Under the EU regulatory systems, marketing authorization applications may be submitted under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. It is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes. Because our products are produced in that way, we would be subject to the centralized process. Under the centralized procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing authorization application to the EMA. Once granted by the European Commission, a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states, as well as the EEA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. By law, a company can only start to market a medicine once it has received a marketing authorization. 
 Research and Development Expense
 Since inception, we have devoted a significant amount of resources to develop our product candidates and our technologies. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recorded $132.8 million, $69.6 million, and $33.4 million, respectively, in research and development expenses.
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 176 employees. Substantially all of our employees are in Bothell, Washington. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
