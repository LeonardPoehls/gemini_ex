ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------



Suffolk Bancorp (the “Company”) was incorporated in 1985 as a bank holding company. The Company currently owns all of the outstanding capital stock of Suffolk County National Bank (the “Bank”). The Bank was organized under the national banking laws of the United States in 1890. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) to the extent provided by law. The income of the Company is primarily derived through the operations of the Bank and its subsidiaries, consisting of the real estate investment trust (“REIT”) Suffolk Greenway, Inc., an insurance agency and two corporations used to acquire foreclosed real estate. The insurance agency and the two corporations used to acquire foreclosed real estate are immaterial to the Company’s operations. The Company had 296 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2016.
 
On June 26, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “merger agreement”) with People’s United Financial, Inc. (“People’s United”) pursuant to which the Company will merge into People’s United (the “merger”). People’s United will be the surviving corporation in the merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the Company’s shareholders will have the right to receive 2.225 shares of People’s United common stock in exchange for each share of Company common stock. The merger agreement was adopted by the Company’s shareholders, and both the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) have approved the merger. The merger remains subject to other customary conditions to closing.
 
The Bank is a full-service bank serving the needs of its local residents through 27 branch offices in Nassau, Suffolk and Queens Counties, New York and loan production offices in Garden City, Melville and Long Island City. The Bank offers a full line of domestic commercial and retail banking services. The Bank makes commercial real estate floating and fixed rate loans, multifamily and mixed use commercial loans primarily in the boroughs of New York City, commercial and industrial loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, developers/contractors and retailers and agricultural loans. The Bank also makes loans secured by residential mortgages, and both floating and fixed rate second mortgage loans with a variety of plans for repayment. Real estate construction loans are also offered.
 
One of the largest community banks headquartered on Long Island, the Company serves clients in its traditional markets on the east end of Long Island, western Suffolk County and in its newer markets of Nassau County and New York City. The Company considers its business to be highly competitive in its market area with numerous competitors for its core niche of small business and middle market clients, as well as retail clients ancillary to these commercial relationships. The Company competes with local, regional and national depository financial institutions, including commercial banks, savings banks, insurance companies, credit unions and money market funds, and other businesses with respect to its lending services and in attracting deposits. Although the New York metropolitan area has a high density of financial institutions, a number of which are significantly larger than the Company, the core deposit franchise the Company has built over its more than 125 years of doing business by focusing its deposit gathering efforts on low cost deposits is unique in the local marketplace and gives it a significant competitive advantage on cost of funds. In addition to serving the banking needs of the communities in its market area, the Company is also known, along with its employees, for its active community involvement.
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company, on a consolidated basis, had total assets of approximately $2.1 billion, total deposits of approximately $1.8 billion and stockholders’ equity of approximately $215 million.
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to the Company include the Company and the Bank on a consolidated basis.
 
Business Segment Reporting
 
The Bank is a community bank, which offers a wide array of products and services to its customers. Pursuant to its banking strategy, emphasis is placed on building relationships with its customers and operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis. As a result, the Company, the only reportable segment, is not organized around discernible lines of business and prefers to work as an integrated unit to customize solutions for its customers, with business line emphasis and product offerings changing over time as needs and demands change.

Supervision and Regulation
 
References in this section to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries only and do not purport to be complete. It is suggested that the reader review such statutes and regulations in their entirety for a full understanding.
 
As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in the United States, the business of the Company and the Bank is particularly susceptible to federal and state legislation that may affect the cost of doing business, modifying permissible activities or enhancing the competitive position of other financial institutions.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) signed into law in 2011 makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires significant rulemaking and mandates multiple studies which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking regulatory agencies are required to draft and implement enhanced supervision, examination and capital standards for depository institutions and their holding companies. The enhanced requirements include, among other things, changes to capital, leverage and liquidity standards and numerous other requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes various new assessments and fees, expands supervision and oversight authority over non-bank subsidiaries, increases the standards for certain covered transactions with affiliates and requires the establishment of minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for insured depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act also established a new federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad authority and permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and enforce consumer protection rules issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Due to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the standard deposit insurance amount is $250 thousand per depositor per insured bank for each account ownership category. In addition, the FDIC assessment is now based on the Bank’s total average assets less tier 1 capital, instead of deposits, and is computed at lower rates.  Following the 2016 U.S. elections, it is possible that the new administration may seek to revise or repeal certain regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, although the extent of any such change remains uncertain.
 
Bank Holding Company Regulation
 
The Company is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHC Act”) and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. Federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions, for violation of laws and policies.
Activities Closely Related to Banking
 
The BHC Act prohibits a bank holding company, with certain limited exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company that is not a bank or from engaging in any activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other subsidiaries or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries. Bank holding companies also may engage in or acquire interests in companies that engage in a limited set of activities that are closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. If a bank holding company has become a financial holding company (an “FHC”), it may engage in a broader set of activities, including insurance underwriting and broker-dealer services as well as activities that are jointly determined by the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. FHCs may also engage in activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve to be complementary to financial activities. The Company has not elected to be an FHC at this time but may make such an election at any time so long as the statutory criteria are satisfied.  In order to become an FHC, the bank holding company and all subsidiary depository institutions must be well managed and well capitalized. Additionally, all subsidiary depository institutions must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating on its most recent Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) examination. At December 31, 2016, the Bank’s CRA rating was “outstanding.”
Safe and Sound Banking Practices
 
Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve Board may order a bank holding company to terminate an activity or control of a nonbank subsidiary if such activity or control constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary bank and is inconsistent with sound banking principles. Regulation Y also requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth.
 
The Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations. Notably, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (“FIRREA”) provides that the Federal Reserve Board can assess civil money penalties for such practices or violations which can be as high as $1 million per day. FIRREA contains expansive provisions regarding the scope of individuals and entities against which such penalties may be assessed.

Annual Reporting and Examinations
 
The Company is required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve Board and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve Board may examine a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries and charge the company for the cost of such an examination. The Company is also subject to reporting and disclosure requirements under state and federal securities laws.
Rules on Regulatory Capital
 
Regulatory capital rules, released in July 2013, implement higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules include a common equity tier 1 capital requirement and establish criteria that instruments must meet in order to be considered common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital. These enhancements are expected to both improve the quality and increase the quantity of capital required to be held by banking organizations, better equipping the U.S. banking system to deal with adverse economic conditions. The capital rules require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a tier 1 capital ratio of 6%, a total capital ratio of 8% and a leverage ratio of 4%. Bank holding companies are also required to hold a capital conservation buffer of common equity tier 1 capital of 2.5% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and executive compensation payments. The capital rules also require banks to maintain a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a tier 1 capital ratio of 8%, a total capital ratio of 10% and a leverage ratio of 5% to be deemed “well capitalized” for purposes of certain rules and prompt corrective action requirements.
 
The rules attempt to improve the quality of capital by implementing changes to the definition of capital. Among the most important changes are stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments that would disallow the inclusion of instruments, such as trust preferred securities, in tier 1 capital going forward and constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the rules require that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity tier 1 capital.
 
Under the rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer will help to ensure that banking organizations conserve capital when it is most needed, allowing them to better weather periods of economic stress. The buffer is measured relative to risk-weighted assets.
 
Community banks, such as the Bank, began transitioning to these rules on January 1, 2015. The new minimum capital requirements were effective on January 1, 2015, whereas the capital conservation buffer and the deductions from common equity tier 1 capital phase in over time. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements was effective January 1, 2016. The Company’s and the Bank’s capital buffers are in excess of both the current and fully phased-in requirements.
 
The Federal Reserve Board may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. At this time, the bank regulatory agencies are more inclined to impose higher capital requirements in order to meet well capitalized standards and future regulatory changes could impose higher capital standards as a routine matter.  The Company’s regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank are in excess of the levels established for “well capitalized” institutions.
 
Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities, as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multifamily mortgages. In accordance with the law, each federal banking agency has specified, by regulation, the levels at which an insured institution would be considered well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. As of December 31, 2016, the Bank exceeded the capital levels required in order to be deemed well capitalized.
 
By statute and regulation a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each bank that it controls and, under appropriate circumstances, may be required to commit resources to support each such controlled bank. This support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide the support.
 
Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA, if a controlled bank is undercapitalized, then the regulators could require the bank holding company to guarantee the bank’s capital restoration plan. In addition, if the Federal Reserve Board believes that a bank holding company’s activities, assets or affiliates represent a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a controlled bank, then the Federal Reserve Board could require the bank holding company to terminate the activities, liquidate the assets or divest the affiliates. The regulators may require these and other actions in support of controlled banks even if such actions are not in the best interests of the bank holding company or its stockholders.

The appropriate federal banking agency may also require a holding company to provide financial assistance to a bank with impaired capital. Under this requirement, in the future the Company could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress. Based on our ownership of a national bank subsidiary, the OCC could assess us if the capital of the Bank were to become impaired. If we failed to pay the assessment within three months, the OCC could order the sale of our stock in the Bank to cover the deficiency.
 
Additionally, FDICIA requires bank regulators to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions. In the event an institution becomes undercapitalized, it must submit a capital restoration plan. If an institution becomes significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, additional and significant limitations are placed on the institution. The capital restoration plan of an undercapitalized institution will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary’s compliance with the capital restoration plan until it becomes adequately capitalized. The Company has control of the Bank for the purpose of this statute.
 
Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies
 
The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve Board is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and the effect on competition. The Attorney General of the United States may, within 30 days after approval of an acquisition by the Federal Reserve Board, bring an action challenging such acquisition under the federal antitrust laws, in which case the effectiveness of such approval is stayed pending a final ruling by the courts. Under certain circumstances, the 30-day period may be shortened to 15 days.
Interstate Acquisitions
 
Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act (“Riegle-Neal Act”), a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company not control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state). The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate branches. The Dodd-Frank Act permits a national or state bank, with the approval of its regulator, to open a branch in any state if the law of the state in which the branch is located would permit the establishment of the branch if the bank were a bank chartered in that state. National banks may provide trust services in any state to the same extent as a trust company chartered by that state.
Bank Regulation
 
The Bank is a national bank, which is subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the OCC and secondarily by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. The Bank is subject to requirements and restrictions under federal law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank.
 
The OCC regularly examines the Bank and records of the Bank. The FDIC may also periodically examine and evaluate insured banks.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness
 
As part of FDICIA’s efforts to promote the safety and soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies, appropriate federal banking regulators are required to have in place regulations specifying operational and management standards (addressing internal controls, loan documentation, credit underwriting and interest rate risk), asset quality and earnings. As discussed above, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC, and the FDIC have extensive authority to police unsafe or unsound practices and violations of applicable laws and regulations by depository institutions and their holding companies. For example, the FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any institution that it determines has engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice. The agencies can also assess civil money penalties of up to $1 million per day, issue cease-and-desist or removal orders, seek injunctions and publicly disclose such actions.
 
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates
 
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative and qualitative limits on transactions between a bank and any affiliate and requires certain levels of collateral for such loans. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the Company. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated companies. In the absence of such comparable transactions, any transaction between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, which in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies.

Governmental Monetary Policies and Economic Conditions
 
The principal sources of funds essential to the business of banks and bank holding companies are deposits, stockholders’ equity and borrowed funds. The availability of these various sources of funds and other potential sources, such as preferred stock or commercial paper, and the extent to which they are utilized depends on many factors, the most important of which are the Federal Reserve Board’s monetary policies and the relative costs of different types of funds. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recession and curb inflationary pressure. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market operations in United States government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. In view of the recent changes in regulations affecting commercial banks and other actions and proposed actions by the federal government and its monetary and fiscal authorities, no prediction can be made as to future changes in interest rates, availability of credit, deposit balances or the overall performance of banks generally or the Company and the Bank in particular.
