Overview
 
We were founded in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2010, as an early stage company operating within the concept architectural, interior design project and related areas in Germany initially. Our plan was to operate in various architectural fields and to be responsible for the concept architectural vision of future private and public buildings as well as municipal organized public areas. Also, we intended to work with interior design view, visualization and renderings. After attempting to implement our business plan, we have determined that it would be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders to seek out and identify potential acquisition partners, joint ventures or other strategic alliances.
 
Accordingly, on June 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange”) with Proto-Script Pharmaceuticals, Corp., a California corporation (“PSPC”), whereby the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of PSPC, in exchange for three Hundred Million (300,000,000) restricted shares of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, PSPC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the business direction of the Company has shifted to the business of PSPC.
 
We are a development stage company. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our common stock trades on the OTC Pink Sheets under the symbol “PSCR”.
 
We do not have any subsidiaries. Our principal office is located at 9830 6th Street, Suite 103, Rancho Cucamonga, California 91730. Our telephone number is (855) 476-7679. Our fiscal year end is December 31.
 
We have incurred losses since our inception. We rely upon the sale of our securities to fund our operations. 
 
We are not involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings.

Who We Are:
 
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on June 27, 2001 under the name of Proto-Script Pharmaceuticals, Corp.
 
The Company’s primary source of revenue comes from the repair and rental of power wheelchairs and scooters. The Company deals with federal, state and private insurance providers such as Medicare, Medi-Cal, Nevada Care and Blue Cross among several others. PSPC has very limited dealings with non-insured cash patients. We have tangible assets comprised of company delivery vehicles, loaner wheelchairs, office equipment and furniture. Inventory is purchased on an as needed basis, typically when patients/customers are approved for coverage by their insurance provider. Intangible assets comprise of its current patient list and working relationships with the various insurance providers who refer their clients to us for their repair and rental needs.
Competitive Advantages
 
We qualify as a “small supplier” as defined by the Medicare competitive bidding program which we feel increases our changes of being awarded winning bids in the upcoming recompete rounds. Regulations stipulate that if 30% of winning companies do not fall under the small supplier category then more small suppliers must be added in essence making our changes one in three or better. We are able to meet our service standards by buying product only on an as needed basis. This prevents the Company from having to output cash before a purchase order is made.
 
All patients are pre-qualified before products are ordered and as such there is a low risk of non-payment. When the insurance provider refuses payment it is typically due to an error on the part of the staff in entering and/or submitting the claim. Upon re-entry the claim is typically successful.
 
Although we do a majority of our purchases from three different suppliers due to better-negotiated prices, we are able to buy the parts and products needed from various local and out of state suppliers.
 
Repair Sales Cycle
 
Our typical repair cycle is as follows:
 


1. | Patient lead
---+-------------
 | a. | New patient referral is sent to PSPC
 | b. | Current patient is called 
 | c. | Current patient calls in 
 | d. | New patient is obtained 


2. | Patient information is gathered and insurance coverage eligibility is verified 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. | Upon verification a repair technician calls the patient for a preliminary telephone diagnosis 
4. | Based on the repairs the technician believes is needed, a second eligibility check is done to confirm the patient qualifies for those specific repairs

5. | The office manager confirms a date and time range with the patient for the technician to pick up the equipment 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. | Routing information is passed on to the repair technician 
7. | Repair technician sanitizes and loads a loaner wheelchair based on the patient’s specific needs and criteria 
8. | Repair technician drops off the loaner chair, picks up the patient’s equipment and fills out the necessary paperwork
9. | The equipment is brought to the warehouse for a thorough diagnosis and forwarded to the office manager 


a. | If is typical upon full diagnostic testing the technician finds other parts in need of replacement or repair

15. | The equipment is delivered to the patient, the loaner is picked up and paperwork is filled by the patient
16. | The loaner equipment is returned to the warehouse, sanitized and stored 

Operating Systems and Controls
 
The Company currently uses a combination of software for the daily business operations. The main billing and patient information software is being phased out and being be replaced by a more current software. We expect the new software to help reduce paper, redundancies, man-hours, mistakes and the potential loss of data while increasing the security of patient’s information. Our billing process will also be more efficient as secondary payers will be processed automatically and triggered at the earliest possible moment.

Growth Strategy
 
The dollar amount and frequency companies are allowed to bill patients and their insurance providers is set by Medicare and therefore our competitors in the same product categories must charge the same price. Margins can be increased by processing more patients and decreasing costs. PSPC has the ability to process more patients without increase overhead and labor cost. Additionally, the Company intends to advertise its billing services to other medical companies around the country. Companies in the durable medical equipment industry use standard Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) in order to submit their invoices electronically to the insurance providers. Other companies can benefit from not needing in-house billing by hiring PSPC to process their payments for a rate of 3-5% of the revenue.
Competitive Bidding Area (CBA)
 
Since the Company does not currently hold a winning bid for one of the competitive bidding (as further explained below) areas (CBAs) it has the potential to significantly increase revenues by doing so. PSPC will also benefit from lower cost of goods because of the expected increase in volume. There are several criteria used to determine a company’s qualification and more than one company can awarded an area and product. We plan to aggressively target products, such as catheters, that don’t fall under CBA in the areas currently serviced of Southern California and Las Vegas.
Current Working Relationships
 
We employ several strategies to increase its revenue. One approach is to increase the referrals from the insurance providers by building relationships based on positive patient feedback. Insurance providers will refer a maximum of patients at any given time equivalent to the number of loaner equipment in stock. For example, by us having 120 loaner power wheelchairs in stock each provider will refer up to 120 patients at a given time.
Current Patient Database
 
A patient qualifies for repairs on their power wheelchair or scooter every six months to one year depending on the part that is in need of repair or replacing and a brand new power wheelchair every five years. The patient database is constantly being contacted to arrange for repair upon a prior successful eligibility check.
Intellectual Property
 
We have no patents or trademarks or applications pending.
 
Government Regulations
 
Numerous federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations, including the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology For Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively HIPAA), govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and disclosure of patients’ individually-identifiable health information. As part of our provision of, and billing for, health care equipment and services, we are required to collect and maintain such protected patient-identifiable health information. New health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, congressional action, state legislative actions or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle health care related data and communicate with payers. Moreover, the cost of complying with these standards could be significant. While we believe we comply in all material respects with HIPAA, and comparable state privacy and security requirements, we cannot provide any assurance that governmental authorities will find that our business practices comply with current or future administrative or judicial interpretations of these regulations. Sanctions for failure to comply with these federal and state laws include significant civil and criminal penalties. A violation could subject us to penalties, fines or possible exclusion from the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Such sanctions could adversely impact our financial condition, revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations.
 
The federal government has made a policy decision to significantly increase the financial resources allocated to enforcing the health care fraud and abuse laws. Private insurers and various state enforcement agencies also have increased their level of scrutiny of health care claims in an effort to identify and prosecute fraudulent and abusive practices in the health care area.

Medicare and Medicaid
 
As part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, Congress enacted the Medicare program, which provides for hospital, physician and other statutorily defined health benefits for qualified individuals, including persons 65 and older and the disabled. The Medicaid program, also established by Congress in 1965, is a joint federal and state program that provides certain statutorily-defined health benefits to financially needy individuals who are blind, disabled, aged or members of families with dependent children.
 
Under existing Medicare laws and regulations, the sale and rental of our products is generally reimbursed by the Medicare program according to prescribed fee schedule amounts calculated using statutorily-prescribed formulas. Significant legislation affecting home medical equipment (HME) reimbursement has been signed into law, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA), the Medicare, Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and changes to these programs and acts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations.
 
Competitive Bidding Area (CBA)
 
The Durable Medical Equipment Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) Competitive Bidding Program was mandated by Congress through the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). The statute requires that Medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for selected Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) items with a competitive bid process. The intent is to improve the effectiveness of the Medicare methodology for setting DMEPOS payment amounts, which will reduce beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses and save the Medicare program money while ensuring beneficiary access to quality items and services.
 
Under the program, a competition among suppliers who operate in a particular competitive bidding area is conducted. Suppliers are required to submit a bid for selected products. Not all products or items are subject to competitive bidding. Bids are submitted electronically through a web-based application process and required documents are mailed. Bids are evaluated based on the supplier’s eligibility, its financial stability and the bid price. Contracts are awarded to the Medicare suppliers who offer the best price and meet applicable quality and financial standards. Contract suppliers must agree to accept assignment on all claims for bid items and will be paid the bid price amount. The amount is derived from the median of all winning bids for an item.
 
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is required by law to recompete contracts under the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program at least once every three years. The Round 2 and national mail-order program contract periods expire on June 30, 2016. The federal government awards contracts to companies in the durable medical equipment (DME) industry upon a successful bid to service the specific areas and products. Winners of bid reserve the right service the competitive bidding areas (CBAs) for a period of two years. After the two year period the contract holders lose their rights and the CBA all interested DME companies as requested to submit a bid.
 
PSPC does not currently hold a winning bid and has submitted a bid for Round 2 Recompete.

The Anti-Kickback Statute
 
Due to high fraud in the industry, companies such as ours that operate within the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to strict fraud and abuse laws often referred to as the “Anti-Kickback statute”. At the federal level, the Anti-Kickback statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing any remuneration, including a bribe, kickback or rebate, directly or indirectly, in return for or to induce the referral of patients, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for products or services covered by federal health care programs. Federal health care programs have been defined to include plans and programs that provide health benefits funded by the federal government, including Medicare and Medicaid, among others. Violations of the Anti-Kickback statute may result in civil and criminal penalties including fines of up to $25,000 per violation, civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000 per violation, assessments of up to three times the amount of the prohibited remuneration, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in the federal health care programs.
 
CHAP Accreditation
 
We are voluntarily part of the Community Health Accreditation Program (CHAP) which is an industry recognized accreditation meeting high standards covering compliance requirements as prescribed by state and federal bodies. Payers and patients appreciated CHAP as a non-biased third-party approval of the company in the industry. CHAP also keeps the Company up-to-date with regulatory changes and provides ongoing education to staff to familiarize themselves on how to stay in compliance.
 
Competition
 
We operated in a highly competitive industry with few national competitors and several local, small and medium sized businesses. Our biggest competitor is Apria Healthcare Group, Inc. which has local national offices. Local competitors include Lincoln Medical and Westview Medical. Management believes that the number of competitors will decrease over the long run because of decreasing profit margins due to the competitive bidding programs implemented by the government. The nature of the competitive bidding encourages lower prices therefore forcing some companies out of businesses.
Employees
 
As of September 14, 2017, we have 13 full time employees. Our employees are not currently represented by a labor union of labor organization. These employees are spread out into various departments, including management, billing, sales and repair. The billing, sales and management are headquartered out of Rancho Cucamonga, CA, while Anaheim, CA serves as repair facilities with limited staff.
 
The Las Vegas office is the headquarters for Nevada as well as it serves as a repair facility. Anaheim and Las Vegas each have outside sales staff. All locations are required to be staffed for a minimum number of hours a week as required by state laws.
 
The sales department includes outside and inside sales people. Outside sales people host fall prevention seminars in order to generate leads. The seminars are held at care facilities and during the presentation the repair technician provides equipment cleaning and onsite repair at no cost.
