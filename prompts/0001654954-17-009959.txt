Industry Background
 
Approximately 100 million Americans do not have broadband at home today and most of them are living in rural communities across America. We intend to be a leading provider of cost-effective and reliable technology services for home, small to medium sized businesses in the areas we serve and to create value to our shareholders.
 
We intend to deliver innovative communications, information and entertainment. Our voice, data and video products and services offer over intelligent wireless, wireline, cable, fiber, broadband and global IP networks that meet customers' growing demand for speed, mobility, security and control. As a committed corporate citizen, we use our advanced communications services to address important issues confronting our society today, especially in rural America. We plan to follow a strategy of being first to our regional markets with technology and services first introduced in metropolitan areas by national service providers.
 
We intend to be a full service, facilities-based cable operator, local exchange and inter-exchange carrier serving both residential and commercial customers by providing voice, data and digital video services. We intend to employ the newest technology available in the marketplace today, which provides quality of service (QoS), reliability, security, redundancy and continuity of service always. In the future, we will be recognized as a leader in the data network, IP telephony and cloud-based services. Our potential customers are located in some of the country’s largest cities to families living in rural communities. We intend to establish a dominant national presence in the triple-play broadband, cable and telecom industry in America.
 
Plan of Operation
 
We are a development stage company, incorporated on October 19, 2012 and have not started operations or generated or realized any revenues from our business operations. However, we have substantial technology assets ready to deploy in the rural markets where we plan to provide our services.
 
Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve (12) months. Our auditors‟ opinion is based on the uncertainty of our ability to establish profitable operations. The opinion results from the fact that we have not generated any revenues. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our Company.
 
Our Officers and Directors are responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. When these controls are implemented, they will be responsible for the administration of the controls. Should they not have sufficient experience, they may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the Securities and Exchange Commission which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment.
 
Since incorporation, the Company has financed its operations originally through private capital and then, loans from stockholders and executives of the Company. As of December 31, 2016 we had $167 cash on hand. We had totaled operating expenses of $47,615 which were related to general and administrative costs (See “Financial Statements”).
 
To date, the Company has not fully implemented its planned principal operations or strategic business plan. SIGMABROADBAND CO. is attempting to secure sufficient monetary assets to increase operations. SIGMABROADBAND CO. cannot assure any investor that it will be able to enter into sufficient business operations adequate enough to insure continued operations.
 
Our intended plan of operations is to offer voice, data, and video services and implement the necessary sales and marketing support to begin generating revenue. If SIGMABROADBAND CO. does not produce sufficient cash flow to support its operations over the next 12 months, the Company will need to raise additional capital by issuing capital stock in exchange for cash in order to continue as a going concern. There are no formal or informal agreements to attain such financing. SIGMABROADBAND CO. cannot assure any investor that, if needed, sufficient financing can be obtained or, if obtained, that it will be on reasonable terms. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for operations to continue and any investment made by an investor would be lost in its entirety.
 
SIGMABROADBAND CO. currently does own significant plant or equipment that it can seek to sell in the near future in order to sustain its operations if not able to raise necessary capital for its business.
 
Our management anticipates hiring employees over the next twelve (12) months as needed. Currently, the Company believes the services provided by its officers and directors appear sufficient at this time.

The Market
 
FCC Broadband Report Synopsis:
 As per the U.S. Federal Government, Broadband is the great infrastructure challenge of the early 21st century. Like electricity a century ago, broadband is a foundation for economic growth, job creation, global competitiveness and a better way of life. It is enabling entire new industries and unlocking vast new possibilities for existing ones. It is changing how we educate children, deliver health care, manage energy, ensure public safety, engage government, and access, organize and disseminate knowledge.
 
But broadband in America is not all where it needs to be. According to the FCC Broadband Report Synopsis, approximately 100 million Americans do not have broadband at home. Broadband-enabled health information technology (IT) can improve care and lower costs by hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming decades, yet the United States is behind many advanced countries in the adoption of such technology. Broadband can provide teachers with tools that allow students to learn the same course material in half the time, but there is a dearth of easily accessible digital educational content required for such opportunities. A broadband-enabled Smart Grid could increase energy independence and efficiency, but much of the data required to capture these benefits are inaccessible to consumers, businesses and entrepreneurs. And nearly a decade after 9/11, our first responders still lack a nationwide public safety mobile broadband communications network, even though such a network could improve emergency response and homeland security.
 
SIGMABROADBAND CO. was created to take advantage of the market demand for communications and entertainment bundled services priced within the reach of all consumers. We are deploying voice, data, digital video and other broadband related services to Rural America. We are positioned to provide services to 45,000 homes in Arizona and another 3,000 homes in Missouri. We plan to extend the Missouri network to another 15,000 homes bringing the total in our franchised area to 18,000. Our intended $99 per month triple-play service standard package of voice, data and digital video will provide a compelling offer that will attract many new subscribers and be a competitive advantage going forward. None of our known competitors have such an offer and if they choose to follow, they will erode their existing revenue base.
 
Market Pricing Strategy
 
Our key market pricing strategy is to bundle our services to provide a more price competitive package to the customers. The "all inclusive and flat rate" billing we promote, allow customers to plan for and budget a fixed price for all their monthly telecommunication services. This billing strategy sets us apart from all of our existing competitors. We intend to provide optimum support and service using state-of-the-art technology and innovative customer care, building long-standing partnerships with our customers, ensuing mutually beneficial returns.

Services and Product
 
Our technology allows us to provide Broadband triple-play services to any market nationwide. Our core business objective is to offer a bundling of services to include telephone service, Internet access, cellular and cable television nationwide; and also providing cloud- based and IPtv services. The Bundled Service or T3 (Triple Play) will be made available to the public at a prepaid fixed cost of $99 per/month with no taxes, no contract, no deposit and no credit needed to the low income families, retirees, unserved, underserved, underprivileged and rural communities, in order to help bridge the technology usage gap in these areas. The potential customer base is extensive, as it literally consists of businesses, residential and rural customers- throughout the 95% of the U.S. covered by our network infrastructure.
Competition
 
Across the United States, Multiple Systems Operators (MSOs) compete with Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) providers and incumbent telecom companies. We believe that we compete with other providers in three product categories: Video, Voice, and Data.
 
We are poised to compete with any competitor that enters our market in terms of price, quality of service and no term contract. Since our operations are in rural areas, we may not have to compete with any regional and national carriers, except for local independent operators and DBS providers.
 
Market Strategy: Rural vs. Urban Markets
 
In rural markets, cable and DBS are often the only providers of video services. Recently, cable companies have been losing video share to DBS, primarily due to the fact that DBS has a greater number of high-definition channels and provides better customer service. We are trying to make up ground by pushing bundled services to customers (HSD and telephony). The current trend of RBOCs providing FTTN or FTTP will mostly affect competitive dynamics in urban markets not in rural markets, as the high amount of CAPEX being spent can only be justified in areas with high density.
 
We will be the only major triple play service provider in all of our rural markets where our cable/hubs infrastructure will be located at present time. The competitive dynamics between RBOCs and Cable MSOs in rural areas, where FTTN and FTTP are not available, favors cable. We will continue to have a competitive advantage in high speed data, voice and digital video. Traditional RBOC services generally do not include video, which will allow us a large bundling advantage. Wireless substitution is most likely to continue, though the rate of substitution will be less in rural areas, where users are more likely to keep wireline phones because of cellular signal issues. We believe that Cable MSOs like SIGMABROADBAND CO. operating primarily in rural markets will face more favorable competitive dynamics than those in urban markets.
 
Our Triple Play Price Strategy and Differences
 
We set ourselves apart from the competition not only by providing a superb customer care and quality of service but also offers our customers a flat rate service at $99/month including all applicable taxes and without any term contract ever for the exact same services that the competition may provide in areas we serve.
Operating Strategy
 
SIGMABROADBAND CO. offers a quality consumer experience, at a reasonable price for entertainment, communications and all broadband services. We intend to always value our customer’s needs and their requests, while balancing the requirement to meet our financial responsibility. Our focus will be greater than customer service; it will be on serving the customer and our strategic assets.
 
Our key to success is to bring the strength of our business development experiences, well trained personnel and cutting-edge technologies in every segment of our core businesses to increase profit margin and increase investors‟ satisfaction, while we deliver value from diversity and promote sustainability for economic and social development.
 
Regulation Challenges
 
There are multiple and intense regulatory battles over triple-play services as incumbent telephone companies and incumbent cable operators attempt to keep out new competitors - since both industries historically have been regulated monopolies, regulatory capture has long been as much a core competency for them as have been prices and terms of service. Cable providers want to compete with telephone companies for local voice service, but want to discourage telephone companies from competing with them for television service. Incumbent telephone companies want to deliver television service but want to block competition for voice service from cable operators. Both industries cloak their demands for favorable regulatory treatment in claims that their positions favor the public interests.

Business Challenges
 
The challenges in offering triple-play are mostly associated with determining the right business model, backend processes, customer care support and economic environment rather than technology. For example, using the right billing platform to address a variety of subscriber demographics or having the appropriate subscriber density to financially justify introduction of the service are a few factors that affect decisions to offer triple-play services.
 
In addition to the challenges mentioned above, there are a number of technical challenges with regards to the rollout of triple play services. Broadband voice, digital video and high speed data all have different characteristics and place different burdens on the network that provides access to these services. Voice services are greatly affected by jitter, whereas packet loss has a greater effect on digital video and data services. In order to use a shared network resource such as cable or DSL, we may use network equipment that employs quality-of-service mechanisms to adjust to the requirements of the different services.
 
SIGMABROADBAND CO. creates a bridge between local exchange carrier and cable service provider all into one network and from one provider, which in turns help reduce the customer’s cost, better quality of service and best customer service experience.
 
The other challenge for us is to provide superior service at a price value point that will attract customers away from existing telecom and cable operators in areas where we compete. We are confident that we will be very competitive with our multiple channels of basic video, a minimum 1.5d/2.0 Mbps Internet connection together with an unlimited local/domestic long distance package all for $99 per month and no other hidden cost to the customer in one network will attract many customers to our Company.
 
Our financial forecasts reflect a rigorous marketing approach that takes advantage of being the newest broadband triple-play provider in the market we serve. This will create a baseline for a significant marketing program should we reach the top of the interest curve.
 
Our Technology
 
We intend to operate Class 4/5 voice switching, routers, digital multiplexers among others and a cable network which allowing us to lower the cost of IP and TDM voice termination to our customers. To date, we have access from 23 head-end locations capable of serving well over 30 rural counties and communities. The current network without expansion spans 923 linear miles, covering more than 8,000 square miles, utilizing 732 miles of fiber optic cable or 4 million feet of fiber infrastructure.
Employees
 
SIGMABROADBAND CO. with the exception of its officers and directors has no other employees, however, works with several outside consultants who have substantial industry experience and who have dedicated time and effort on behalf of the Company.
 
The Company may be required to hire an attorney on a consultancy basis to navigate permit and licensing requirements, but otherwise SIGMABROADBAND CO.‟s Officers and Directors intend to do whatever work is necessary to bring the Company to the point of earning revenues from the sale of our services or further acquisitions. All operational functions such as customer service representatives, telemarketing, warehousing and fulfillment are planned to be outsourced. Human resource planning will be part of an ongoing process that will include constant evaluation of operations and revenue realization.
