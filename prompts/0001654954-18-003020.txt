  Business Overview
  
 Voltari Corporation ("Voltari" the "Company" “we,” “our” or “us”), a Delaware corporation, is in the business of acquiring, financing and leasing commercial real properties. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we own two commercial real properties. One property is in Long Branch, New Jersey, which we lease to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Chase”) pursuant to a triple net lease (the “Long Branch Lease”). The second property is in Flanders, New York, which we lease to 7-Eleven Corporation ("7-Eleven") pursuant to a double net lease (the "Flanders Lease"). All of our revenue is derived from the rental income we receive under these two leases. Future acquisitions are intended to be initially financed through borrowings available under our $30 million Amended Note (as defined herein) with Koala (as defined herein). The Company leases its properties and intends to lease any future properties pursuant to “double net” or “triple net” leases. The Company intends to explore additional strategic opportunities from time to time, which may include opportunities with respect to its intellectual property investments in various industries or acquisitions.
  
 The Company had previously been engaged in the business of providing mobile marketing and advertising solutions to brands, marketers and advertising agencies. In August, 2015, we began implementing a transformation plan pursuant to which, among other things, we exited our mobile marketing and advertising business.
  
 Voltari was incorporated under the name “Mobile Systems Corp.” on December 14, 2012 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Motricity, Inc. (“Motricity”), and changed its name to “Voltari Corporation” on January 16, 2013. On April 9, 2013, pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization by and among Motricity, Voltari and Voltari Merger Sub, Inc. and intending to protect the long-term value of Motricity’s net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs"), Motricity became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Voltari (the “Reorganization”). For purposes of Rule 12g-3(a), we are the successor issuer to Motricity. On April 10, 2013, shares of our common stock commenced trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “VLTC.”
  
  Transformation Plan—Prior to July 1, 2013, most of our revenue was derived from providing hosting services to wireless carriers. Starting in 2012, we began our exit from most of our international carrier business and, on June 30, 2013, concluded our U.S. carrier business. On October 31, 2013, we completed the sale of our Gen5 business. On May 30, 2014, we completed the sale of our U.S. and Canadian messaging business. Further, on September 1, 2014, we completed the sale of our wireless carrier business in the UK.
  
 In connection with our efforts to realign our strategic path, we shifted our focus to the mobile marketing and advertising business and continued to reduce our cost structure. We implemented various cost reduction measures, including reductions in our workforce and a restructuring of our facilities and data centers. Further, in January 2015, we significantly reduced the size of our engineering staff and terminated operations at our Seattle Data Center as part of our ongoing efforts to reduce our operating expenses, particularly the cost of research and development and the delivery of advertising.
  
 Beginning in late May, 2015, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) undertook a review of the Company’s prospects, cost-cutting efforts and strategic alternatives. As part of its review, the Board considered alternative businesses the Company could enter into that would preserve the Company’s assets and maximize shareholder value. Based on its assessment of the Company’s prospects and cost structure including, among other factors, the Company’s performance during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015, recent forecasts provided by management, input from an independent consultant, and potential strategic alternatives available to the Company, the Board concluded that our cost-cutting efforts had not kept pace with our declining revenue, that our forecasted cash burn and revenue potential were unsatisfactory and that effecting the transformation plan by exiting the mobile marketing and advertising business and entering into the real estate investment business was in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders. Accordingly, in August 2015, we committed to and began implementing a transformation plan pursuant to which, among other things, we exited our mobile marketing and advertising business and entered into the business of acquiring, financing and leasing commercial real estate properties. The Company leases its properties and intends to lease any future properties pursuant to so-called “double net” or “triple net” leases. The Company has significantly reduced its workforce in connection with its transformation plan. The Board believes that, if successfully implemented, the Company can, over time, generate profits from the transformation plan.

  NASDAQ Delisting— On December 14, 2016, we received written notification from NASDAQ indicating that the trading of our common stock would be suspended with the opening of business on December 23, 2016. Since December 23, 2016, our common stock has been quoted on the OTCQB marketplace under the symbol “VLTC.”
  
  Expiration of Warrants— On October 11, 2017, warrants to purchase 1,014,958 shares of our common stock expired without being exercised.
  
  Real Estate Investment
  
 The Company is in the business of acquiring, financing and leasing commercial real properties. The Company leases its properties and intends to lease any future properties pursuant to so-called “double net” or “triple net” leases. Future acquisitions are intended to be initially financed through borrowings available under our $30 million Amended Note with Koala. See Note 7 - Liquidity and Capital Resources to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
  
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have completed two real estate acquisitions. On January 19, 2018, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Voltari Real Estate Holding LLC (“Voltari Holding”), entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the ‘McClatchy Purchase Agreement”) with The State Media Company, a South Carolina corporation, to purchase a real estate parcel in Columbia, South Carolina. The closing of the purchase is subject to customary conditions precedent, including a due diligence period. The Company makes no assurances that the conditions will be satisfied or that the purchase will be consummated in a timely manner, if at all. See Note 19 - Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
  
 Until and unless we acquire additional properties, the rental payments associated with our two properties will represent the sole source of our revenues. The termination of the leases associated with these properties or our failure to maintain our leases on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors.

  Properties
  
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we own two commercial real properties. All of our revenue is derived from the rental income we receive under the leases associated with these two properties.
  
 The Long Branch property is located at 160 Brighton Avenue, City of Long Branch, New Jersey (the "Long Branch Property") and has a retail bank branch building situated thereon. The original term of the lease expires in June 2020 (with two, five-year renewal options). Pursuant to the lease, Chase is responsible for the payment of basic rent as well as the payment of real estate taxes, maintenance costs, utilities, tenant's insurance and other property related costs. The average annual rental income for the property over the remaining term of the original lease is expected to be approximately $203,000, exclusive of the amortization of the above market lease intangible.
  
 The Flanders property is located at 721 Flanders Road, Flanders, New York (the "Flanders Property") and has a retail convenience store situated thereon. The original term of the lease expires in December 2029 (with four, five-year renewal options). Pursuant to the lease, 7-Eleven is responsible for the payment of basic rent as well as the payment of, subject to certain exceptions, real estate taxes, utilities, tenant's insurance and other property related costs. Voltari Holding, as landlord is responsible for certain maintenance and repair costs.

 On January 19, 2018, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Voltari Holding, entered into the McClatchy Purchase Agreement. The closing of such purchase is subject to customary conditions precedent, including a due diligence period.

 On February 26, 2018, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Voltari Holding, entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the McClatchy Purchase Agreement. The First Amendment, among other things, extends the Review Period (as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement) to March 30, 2018, and extends the Closing Date (as such term is defined in the First Amendment) to not later than April 16, 2018.
  
 See Note 19 - Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
  
  Competition
  
 The commercial real estate industry is highly competitive, and we will face competition from many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including individuals, corporations, REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, and other investors, some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources and lower costs of capital. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors.
 Financing Arrangements
  
 On August 7, 2015, we, as borrower, and Koala Holdings LP, as lender, an affiliate of Mr. Carl C. Icahn, the Company’s controlling stockholder ("Koala"), entered into a $10 million revolving loan facility (the “Prior Note") at a rate equal to the greater of the LIBOR rate plus 350 basis points, per annum, and 3.75%, per annum, plus a fee of 0.25% per annum on undrawn amounts. The Company sought and received the Prior Note to, in part, allay potential concerns regarding the Company’s ability to invest in and execute its transformation plan while retaining cash levels sufficient to fund its ongoing operations. There were no limitations on the use of proceeds under the Prior Note. As collateral for the Prior Note, we pledged and granted to Koala a lien on our limited liability company interest in Voltari Holding.
  
 Our Board formed a special committee of independent directors (the “Special Committee”) to negotiate the structure and terms of the Prior Note. The Special Committee consisted of James L. Nelson, a former member of our Board, and Jay A. Firestone. In connection with its negotiation of the structure and terms of the Prior Note, the Special Committee retained and received advice from its own legal counsel as well as an independent financial advisor. The Special Committee received an opinion from its independent financial advisor that the financial terms of the Prior Note were fair, from a financial point of view, to us. The Special Committee approved the terms and conditions of, and our entry into, the Prior Note.

 On March 29, 2017, we and Koala amended and restated the Prior Note (the “Amended Note”). Pursuant to the Amended Note, Koala made available to the Company a revolving loan facility of up to $30 million in aggregate principal amount (the “Commitment”). The Company may, by written notice to Koala, request that the Commitment be increased (the “Increased Commitment”), provided that the aggregate amount of all borrowings, plus availability under the aggregate Increased Commitment, shall not exceed $80 million. Koala has no obligation to provide any Increased Commitment and may refuse to do so in its sole discretion.
  
 The Amended Note provides that the net proceeds thereunder in excess of $10 million will be used by the Company for the acquisition, improvement, development, modification, alteration, repair, maintenance, financing or leasing of real property, including any fees and expenses associated with such activities. In connection with the negotiation of the structure and terms of the Amended Note, the Board, which consists entirely of independent directors, retained and received advice from its own legal counsel as well as an independent financial advisor. The Board received an opinion from its independent financial advisor that the financial terms of the Amended Note are fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company. The Board approved the terms and conditions of, and the Company’s entry into, the Amended Note.
  
 Borrowings under the Amended Note will bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Amended Note) plus 200 basis points, per annum, subject to a maximum rate of interest of 3.75%, per annum. The Amended Note matures on the earliest of (i) December 31, 2020, (ii) the date on which any financing transaction, whether debt or equity, is consummated by the Company (or its successors and assigns) with net proceeds in an amount equal to or greater than $30 million, and (iii) at the Company’s option, a date selected by the Company that is earlier than December 31, 2020 (the “Maturity Date”). The Amended Note also allows the Company to, upon written notice to Koala not more than 60 days and not less than 30 days prior to the Maturity Date, request that Koala extend the Maturity Date to December 31, 2022. Koala may, in its sole discretion, agree to extend the Maturity Date by providing written notice to the Company on or before the date that is 20 days prior to the Maturity Date.
  
 If an event of default (as defined in the Amended Note) exists, the Amended Note will bear interest at a default rate equal to the greater of the LIBOR Rate plus 300 basis points, per annum, and 4.5%, per annum. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended Note, the Company may repay all or any portion of the amounts outstanding under the Amended Note at any time without premium or penalty. The amounts available under the Commitment or Increased Commitment, as the case may be, will increase and decrease in direct proportion to repayments and reborrowing’s under the Amended Note, respectively, from time to time. As collateral for the Amended Note, the Company has pledged and granted to Koala a lien on the Company’s limited liability company interest in Voltari Holding.
  
 As of December 31, 2017, borrowings under the Amended Note equaled $5.5 million. The outstanding balance, including interest of $0.3 million, totaled $5.8 million.
