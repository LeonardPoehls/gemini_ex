 ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
 
General Development of the Business
 
In this 10-K, “we”, “us”, “our”, “MREIC” or “the Company”, refers to Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, together with its predecessors and subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
 
The Company is a corporation operating as a qualified real estate investment trust (REIT) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The Company has been a REIT since 1969 and intends to maintain its qualification as a REIT in the future. As a qualified REIT, with limited exceptions, the Company will not be taxed under Federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on taxable income that it distributes to its shareholders. For special tax provisions applicable to REITs, refer to Sections 856-860 of the Code.
 
The Company was established in 1968 as a New Jersey Business Trust (NJBT). In 1990, the NJBT merged into a newly formed Delaware corporation. On May 15, 2003, the Company changed its state of incorporation from Delaware to Maryland by merging with and into a Maryland corporation (the Reincorporation).
 
Narrative Description of Business
 
The Company’s primary business is the ownership of real estate. Its investment focus is to own well-located, modern, single tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. In addition, the Company owns a portfolio of REIT investment securities which the Company generally limits to no more than approximately 10% of its undepreciated assets (which is the Company’s total assets excluding accumulated depreciation).
 
At September 30, 2017, the Company held investments in 108 properties totaling approximately 18,790,000 square feet with an occupancy rate of 99.3% (See Item 2 for a detailed description of the properties). These properties are located in 30 states: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. All of these properties are wholly-owned with the exception of the two properties in New Jersey in which the Company owns a majority interest. All properties in which the Company has investments are leased on a net basis except an industrial park in Monaca (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania and the shopping center located in Somerset, New Jersey.
 
During fiscal 2017, the Company purchased 10 industrial properties totaling approximately 2,784,000 square feet with net-leased terms ranging from seven to fifteen years resulting in a weighted average lease maturity of 13.4 years. Approximately 1,840,000 square feet, or 66%, is leased to FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., a subsidiary of FedEx Corporation (FDX). The aggregate purchase price for the 10 properties was approximately $286,521,000 and they are located in Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. These 10 properties generate annualized rental income over the life of their leases of approximately $18,953,000. In connection with the 10 properties acquired during the 2017 fiscal year, the Company entered into nine, fifteen-year, fully-amortizing mortgage loans and one twelve-year, fully-amortizing loan. The 10 mortgage loans originally totaled $188,809,000 with an original weighted average loan maturity of 14.9 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.90%.
 
Subsequent to fiscal yearend, on October 2, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a 6.25% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, raising it to $0.17 per share from $0.16 per share. This represents an annualized dividend rate of $0.68 per share. The Company has maintained or increased its cash dividend for 26 consecutive years.

Subsequent to fiscal yearend, on November 2, 2017, the Company purchased a newly constructed 121,683 square foot industrial building, situated on 16.2 acres, located in Charleston, SC. The building is 100% net-leased to FDX for 15 years through August 2032. The purchase price was $21,872,170. The Company obtained a 15 year fully-amortizing mortgage loan of $14,200,000 at a fixed interest rate of 4.23%. Annual rental revenue over the remaining term of the lease averages approximately $1,312,000.
 
Subsequent to fiscal yearend, on November 1, 2017, the Company leased its previously vacant 36,270 square foot facility located in Urbandale (Des Moines), IA for 10.2 years.
 
The industrial properties purchased, leased and expanded during fiscal 2018 to date increased our current total leasable square feet to approximately 18,912,000 and increased our occupancy rate to 99.5%.
 
In addition to the property purchased subsequent to the fiscal yearend, as described above, the Company has entered into agreements to purchase three new build-to-suit, industrial buildings that are currently being developed in Florida, Georgia and Oklahoma, consisting of approximately 1,531,000 square feet, with net-leased terms of 10 years each. The purchase price for these properties is approximately $117,437,000. Approximately 1,132,000 square feet, or 74%, is leased to an investment grade tenant or its subsidiary. Subject to satisfactory due diligence and other customary closing conditions and requirements, we anticipate closing these transactions during fiscal 2018. In connection with the three properties, the Company has entered into commitments to obtain three mortgages totaling $72,400,000 at fixed rates ranging from 3.53% to 4.25%, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.75% and with a weighted average maturity of 13.2 years. The Company may make additional acquisitions in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, and the funds for these acquisitions may come from funds generated from operations, mortgages, draws on our unsecured line of credit facility, cash on hand, sale of marketable securities, other bank borrowings, proceeds from the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP), proceeds from the At-The-Market Preferred Equity Program (Preferred Stock ATM Program), and proceeds from private placements and public offerings of additional common or preferred stock or other securities. To the extent that funds or appropriate properties are not available, fewer acquisitions will be made.


Currently, the Company derives its income primarily from real estate rental operations. Rental and Reimbursement Revenue (excluding Lease Termination Income in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $-0-, $-0- and $238,625, respectively) was $113,545,982, $94,916,110 and $77,775,497 for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total undepreciated assets (which is the Company’s total assets excluding accumulated depreciation) were $1,615,768,028 and $1,367,982,470 as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
As of September 30, 2017, the Company had approximately 18,790,000 square feet of property, of which approximately 9,391,000 square feet, or 50%, consisting of 58 separate stand-alone leases, were leased to FDX and its subsidiaries (7% to FDX and 43% to FDX subsidiaries). These properties are located in 24 different states. As of September 30, 2017, the only tenants that leased 5% or more of the Company’s total square footage were FDX and its subsidiaries and Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation, which leased approximately 862,000 square feet, comprising approximately 5% of the Company’s rental space.
 
During fiscal 2017, the only tenant that accounted for 5% or more of the Company’s rental and reimbursement revenue was FDX (including its subsidiaries). The Company’s rental and reimbursement revenue from FDX and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, totaled approximately $68,151,000, $52,793,000 and $41,954,000, or 60% (7% from FDX and 53% from FDX subsidiaries), 56% (7% from FDX and 49% from FDX subsidiaries) and 54% (8% from FDX and 46% from FDX subsidiaries), of total rent and reimbursement revenues.

FDX is a publicly-owned company and financial information related to this entity is available at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. FDX is rated “BBB” by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and is rated “Baa2” by Moody’s (www.moodys.com), which are both considered “Investment Grade” ratings. The references in this report to the SEC’s website, S&P Global Ratings’ website and Moody’s website are not intended to and do not include or incorporate by reference into this report the information of FDX, S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s on such websites.
 
In addition to real estate property holdings, the Company held $123,764,770 in marketable REIT securities at September 30, 2017, representing 7.7% of the Company’s undepreciated assets (which is the Company’s total assets excluding accumulated depreciation). These liquid real estate holdings are not included in calculating the tenant concentration ratios above and therefore further enhance the Company’s diversification. The securities portfolio provides the Company with additional diversification, liquidity, and income, and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available.
 
The Company’s weighted-average lease expiration was 7.9 and 7.4 years as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and its average annualized rent per occupied square foot as of September 30, 2017 and 2016 was $5.93 and $5.72, respectively. The Company’s occupancy rate as of September 30, 2017 and 2016 was 99.3% and 99.6%, respectively. Subsequent to fiscal yearend, on November 1, 2017, the Company leased its previously vacant 36,270 square foot facility located in Urbandale (Des Moines), IA for 10.2 years which increased our current occupancy rate to 99.5%. In addition, the Company is under contract to sell its only currently vacant building located in Ft. Myers, FL, for $6,400,000.
 
The Company competes with other investors in real estate for attractive investment opportunities. These investors include other equity real estate investment trusts, limited partnerships, syndications and private investors, among others. Competition in the market areas in which the Company operates is significant and affects the Company’s ability to acquire or expand properties, occupancy levels, rental rates, and operating expenses of certain properties. Management has built long-term relationships within the merchant builder community which have historically provided the Company with investment opportunities that fit the Company’s investment policy. The amount of new construction of industrial properties on the national level has been increasing the past five years following several years of historically low levels of new supply. These levels of new supply, although increasing, continue to be below historical norms. Driven to a large extent by the continued growth in ecommerce sales, demand for industrial space remains very strong, driving national occupancy rates to an all-time high of 95% currently. For further discussion of potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see Item 1A: Risk Factors below.
 
The Company continues to invest in marketable securities of other REITs, which the Company generally limits to no more than approximately 10% of its undepreciated assets (which is the Company’s total assets excluding accumulated depreciation). The Company’s investments in equity securities of other REITs provides the Company with additional diversification, liquidity, and income, and serves as a proxy for real estate when more favorable risk adjusted returns are not available. The Company from time to time may purchase these securities on margin when the interest and dividend yields exceed the cost of funds. In general, the Company may borrow up to 50% of the value of the marketable securities, which was $123,764,770 as of September 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had borrowings of $10,091,417 under its margin line, bearing interest at 2.05%. As of September 30, 2016, there were no draws against the margin. The REIT securities portfolio, to the extent not pledged to secure borrowings, provides the Company with additional liquidity and additional income. Such securities are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, primarily market price risk relating to equity securities and interest rate risk relating to debt securities. From time to time, the Company may use derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk, however, this has not occurred during any periods presented. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $123,764,770 and $73,604,894, respectively, of securities available for sale. The unrealized net gain on securities available for sale at September 30, 2017 and 2016 was $6,570,565 and $12,942,267, respectively, resulting in a decrease for the fiscal year of $6,371,702. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company’s net realized gains from the sale of securities were $2,311,714, $4,398,599 and $805,513, respectively.

The Company redeemed all of the 2,139,750 outstanding shares of the 7.625% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (7.625% Series A Preferred Stock), on October 14, 2016, at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, totaling $53,493,750, plus all dividends, in the amount of $498,540, which were accrued and unpaid, up to and including the redemption date. The redemption price for the 7.625% Series A Preferred Stock, including its related accumulated and unpaid dividends, was paid with a portion of the net proceeds from the Company’s issuance on September 13, 2016 of 5,400,000 shares of its 6.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (6.125% Preferred Stock) at an offering price and liquidation preference of $25.00 per share in an underwritten public offering. The Company recognized a deemed dividend of $2,942,149 on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, which represents the difference between redemption value and carrying value net of original deferred issuance costs.
 
The Company redeemed all of the 2,300,000 outstanding shares of the 7.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (7.875% Series B Preferred Stock) on June 7, 2017, at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, totaling $57,500,000, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends for the period from June 1, 2017 up to and not including, the redemption date, in an amount equal to $0.0328125, totaling $75,469, for a total cash payment of $25.0328125 per share, totaling $57,575,469. The Company recognized a deemed dividend of $2,467,165 on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, which represents the difference between redemption value and carrying value net of original deferred issuance costs.
 
On March 9, 2017, the Company issued an additional 3,000,000 shares of its 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock at a public offering price of $24.50 per share, for gross proceeds of $73,500,000 before deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, were approximately $71,003,000. On June 7, 2017, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to redeem all of the outstanding shares of its 7.875% Series B Preferred Stock, including its related accumulated and unpaid dividends, as discussed above. The remaining proceeds were used to purchase properties in the ordinary course of business and for general corporate purposes.
 
On June 29, 2017, the Company entered into the Preferred Stock ATM Program with FBR Capital Markets & Co. in which the Company may, from time to time, offer and sell additional shares of its 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, having an aggregate sales price of up to $100,000,000. The Company began selling shares through the Preferred Stock ATM Program on July 3, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, the Company sold 1,439,445 shares under its Preferred Stock ATM Program at a weighted average price of $25.31 per share, and generated net proceeds, after offering expenses, of approximately $35,730,000.
 
As of September 30, 2017, 9,839,445 shares of the 6.125% Series C Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.
 
Subsequent to fiscal yearend to date, the Company sold 820,290 shares under its Preferred Stock ATM Program at a weighted average price of $25.14 per share, and generated net proceeds, after offering expenses, of approximately $20,296,000.
 
Investment and Other Policies
 
The Company’s investment policy is to concentrate its investments in well-located, modern, single-tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. The Company’s strategy is to obtain a favorable yield spread between the income from the net-leased industrial properties and interest costs. In addition, management believes that investments in well-located, modern industrial properties provide a potential for long-term capital appreciation. There is the risk that, upon expiration of leases, the properties will become vacant or will be re-leased at lower rents. The results obtained by the Company from re-leasing the properties will depend on the market for industrial properties at that time.
 
In fiscal 2017, approximately 10% of our gross leasable area, representing 13 leases totaling 1,539,526 square feet, was set to expire. The Company has renewed 12 of these 13 leases that were set to expire. One of the 12 leases, (which is with FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. for a property located in Ft. Myers, FL), renewed for only eight months because the tenant moved its operations from our 87,500 square foot facility to our newly constructed facility, which is also located in Ft. Myers, FL. The Company purchased the new facility, consisting of 213,672 square feet on December 30, 2016 and this new facility is leased for 10 years. On September 1, 2017, a parking lot expansion for this property was completed for a cost of approximately $862,000, resulting in a new 10 year lease which extended the prior lease expiration date from September 2026 to August 2027. The original Ft. Myers, FL facility is under contract to sell for approximately $6,400,000, which is approximately $2,400,000 above the Company’s U.S. GAAP net book carrying value.

Excluding the eight-month lease renewal at the original Ft. Myers, FL location, the 11 leases that have renewed during fiscal 2017 represent 1,415,756 square feet, or 92% of the expiring square footage and represent 5.7% of the space up for renewal in fiscal 2017. These 11 lease renewals resulted in a weighted average term of 6.8 years and a U.S. GAAP straight-line weighted average lease rate of $5.70 per square foot. The weighted average initial cash rent per square foot is $5.59. This compares to the former weighted average rent of $5.73 per square foot on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and the former weighted average cash rent of $5.82 per square foot, representing a decrease in the weighted average lease rate of 0.5% on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and a decrease in the weighted average lease rate of 4.0% on a cash basis.
 
The one property subject to a lease that expired in fiscal 2017 and was not renewed was our 36,270 square foot facility located in Urbandale (Des Moines), IA. Effective November 1, 2017, the Company entered into a 10.2 year lease agreement with a new tenant for this facility. The lease agreement provides for two months of free rent, after which initial annual rent of $159,588, representing $4.40 per square foot, will commence, with 2.0% annual increases thereafter, resulting in a straight-line annualized rent of approximately $172,000, representing $4.74 per square foot over the life of the lease. This compares to the former average straight-lined rent of $3.56 per square foot on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and the former cash rent of $3.88 per square foot, representing an increase in the average lease rate of 33.1% on a U.S. GAAP straight-line basis and an increase in the lease rate of 13.4% on a cash basis.
 
The Company seeks to invest in well-located, modern, single tenant, industrial buildings, leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. In management’s opinion, the newly built facilities meet these criteria. The Company has a concentration of properties leased to FDX and FDX subsidiaries. This is a risk that shareholders should consider. FDX is a publicly-owned company and financial information related to this entity is available at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. FDX is rated “BBB” by S&P Global Ratings (www.standardandpoors.com) and is rated “Baa2” by Moody’s (www.moodys.com), which are both considered “Investment Grade” ratings. The references in this report to the SEC’s website, S&P Global Ratings’ website and Moody’s website are not intended to and do not include or incorporate by reference into this report the information of FDX, S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s on such websites.
 
The Company may issue securities for property; however, this has not occurred to date. The Company may repurchase or reacquire its shares from time to time if, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, such acquisition is advantageous to the Company. No shares were repurchased or reacquired during fiscal 2017 and, as of September 30, 2017, the Company does not own any of its own shares.
 
Property Management
 
Currently, all 108 properties owned by the Company, with the exception of three properties that are located in Stow, Ohio, Streetsboro, Ohio and Carlstadt, New Jersey, are self-managed by the Company.
 
The Company paid fees directly to local property management subagents in the amount of $393,622, $356,316 and $306,487 for fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
The Company’s industrial properties in Stow, Ohio and Streetsboro, Ohio are managed by GEIS Companies (GEIS). Management fees paid to GEIS for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $52,358, $50,082 and $50,112, respectively. These management fees were reimbursed to the Company by the tenants.
 
The Company’s industrial property in Carlstadt, New Jersey is owned by Palmer Terrace Realty Associates, LLC. The Company owns 51% of Palmer Terrace Realty Associates, LLC. This property is managed by Marcus Associates, an entity affiliated with the owner of the 49% non-controlling interest. Management fees paid by Palmer Terrace Realty Associates, LLC to Marcus Associates were $15,804 for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Environmental Matters
 
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, an owner of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under such property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances. These liabilities may include government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances. Although generally our tenants are primarily responsible for any environmental damages and claims related to the leased premises, in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of a tenant of such premises to satisfy any obligations with respect to such environmental liability, the Company may be required to satisfy such obligations. In addition, as the owner of such properties, the Company may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims irrespective of the provisions of any lease.
 
From time to time, in connection with managing the properties or upon acquisition of a property, the Company authorizes the preparation of Phase I and, when necessary, Phase II environmental reports with respect to its properties. Based upon such environmental reports and the Company’s ongoing review of its properties, as of the date of this Annual Report, the Company is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of its properties which it believes would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and/or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however, that (1) the discovery of environmental conditions, the existence or severity of which were previously unknown; (2) changes in law; (3) the conduct of tenants; or (4) activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties, will not expose the Company to material liability in the future.

Segment Reporting & Financial Information
 
The Company’s primary business is the ownership and management of real estate properties. The Company invests in well-located, modern, single tenant, industrial buildings leased primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries on long-term net leases. The Company reviews operating and financial information for each property on an individual basis and, therefore, each property represents an individual operating segment. The Company evaluates financial performance using Net Operating Income (NOI) from property operations. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as recurring Rental and Reimbursement Revenue, less Real Estate Taxes and Operating Expenses, such as insurance, utilities and repairs and maintenance. The Company has aggregated the properties into one reportable segment as the properties share similar long-term economic characteristics and have other similarities, including the fact that they are operated as industrial properties subject to long-term net leases primarily to investment-grade tenants or their subsidiaries. For required financial information related to our operations and assets, please refer to our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report.
