 Products and Applications
 ﻿
 Measurement Solutions
 ﻿
 Perceptron’s In-Line and Near-Line measurement solutions are based on our scanning sensors and software developed by combining Helix® and TriCam® sensors with Vector software.  Our Off-Line measurement solutions are based on a full CMM line plus measuring software.  Measurement Solutions in our fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015 represented 90%, 90% and 89% of total sales, respectively.
 ﻿
 In-Line and Near-Line
 ﻿
 AutoGauge®: These systems are used in assembly and fabrication plants to contain, correct and control the quality of complex assemblies. AutoGauge® systems are placed directly in the manufacturing line or near the line to automatically measure critical dimensional characteristics of parts using non-contact, laser triangulation sensors.  AutoGauge® can be installed with fixed-mounted sensors, with robot-mounted sensors, or as a hybrid system using both fixed and robot-mounted sensors.  This capability provides manufacturers with the flexibility to measure multiple part types on a single manufacturing line while maintaining high-speed production rates. 
 ﻿
 AutoFit®: These systems are primarily used in automotive manufacturing plants to contain, correct and control the fit of exterior body panels. The system automatically measures, records and displays the gap and flushness of parts most visible to the automobile consumer such as gaps between front and rear doors, hoods and fenders as well as deck lids and rear quarter panels. These measurements can be conducted throughout the manufacturing process, including in the body shop during assembly of non-painted vehicles and in the final assembly area after the vehicle has been painted.  AutoFit® has the ability to measure vehicles while in motion along the assembly line or in a stationary position.
 ﻿
 AutoScan®:  These systems are used by manufacturing companies to contain, correct and control the quality of manufactured components. These systems use robot-mounted sensors to scan a part as the robot moves through its path. The AutoScan® system collects the “point cloud data” required for contour analysis and dimensional feature extraction. This allows the part’s shape, geometric features and measurements to be automatically scanned and captured as well as compared to design requirements.  
 ﻿
 AutoGuide®:  These robot guidance systems are used by manufacturing companies for flexible, automated assembly applications. These systems utilize Perceptron sensors and measurement technology to guide and control robotic assembly operations.  AutoGuide® systems calculate the difference between theoretical and actual relationships of a robot to the part being assembled and communicate compensation data in six degrees of freedom to the robot. AutoGuide® supports numerous robotic assembly applications including automotive windshield insertion, roof loading, hinge mounting, door attachment and sealant application. 
 ﻿
 Helix®:  Helix® is a 3D metrology sensor that enables manufacturers to perform their most challenging measurement tasks rapidly, with greater ease and precision. Helix® solutions offer Intelligent Illumination® allowing the user to choose the quantity, density and orientation of the sensor's laser lines on an individual inspection point level without moving the sensor. By customizing the sensor's laser lines through a simple user interface, image acquisition is optimized on a feature-by-feature basis. The user can configure tightly spaced laser lines for small, complex features, or increase the number of laser lines to robustly measure challenging materials as well as alter the orientation of the laser lines to accommodate the differences between multiple parts manufactured on the same assembly line.  
 ﻿
 Off-Line 
 ﻿
 Coord3®: The Coord3 CMM product line includes bridge, gantry and horizontal style machines.  Bench-top CMM are used for small part inspection while very large CMM are used in aerospace, defense and heavy equipment industries.  CMM can be equipped with tactile scanning probes and our TouchDMIS™ measuring software.  
 ﻿
 TouchDMISTM :   TouchDMIS™ measuring software simplifies CMM measurement by incorporating a 100% Touch interface with the TouchCADTM quick programming module.  TouchDMIS™ is the world’s first all-touch CMM software.  
 ﻿
 3D Scanning Solutions
 ﻿
 3D Scanning Solutions in our fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015 represented 7%, 6% and 7% of total sales, respectively.
 ﻿
 WheelWorks®:  WheelWorks® software and sensors offer a fast, accurate, non-contact method of measuring wheel position for use in automated or manual wheel alignment machines in automotive assembly plants.  Perceptron supplies sensors and software to a number of wheel alignment equipment manufacturers in Europe, Asia and North America who in turn sell alignment systems to automotive manufacturers.

     Sales and Marketing
 ﻿
 We market our in-line and near-line products directly to end-user OEM customers and through manufacturing line builders and system integrators. We market our Coord3 CMM product line through both direct sales and value added resellers.
     Perceptron’s principal customers have historically been automotive manufacturing companies that we either sell to directly or through manufacturing line builders, system integrators or assembly equipment manufacturers.  Our products are typically purchased for installation in connection with retooling programs undertaken by these companies.  Because sales are dependent on the timing of customers’ retooling programs, sales by customer vary significantly from year to year.  For our fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 36%, 34% and 40%, respectively, of our “Net Sales” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations were derived from sales directly to our four largest automotive end-user customers.  We also sell to manufacturing line builders, system integrators or assembly equipment manufacturers, who in turn sell to our automotive customers.  For our fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 11%, 8% and 10%, respectively, of our net sales were to manufacturing line builders, system integrators and original equipment manufacturers for the benefit of the same four largest automotive end-user customers in each respective year.  During our fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, direct sales to Volkswagen Group accounted for approximately 16%, 17% and 20%, respectively, and direct sales to General Motors Company accounted for approximately 14%, 12% and 12%, respectively, of our total net sales.  
     Manufacturing and Suppliers
 ﻿
 Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly and calibration of hardware components and the testing and integration of our software with these hardware components.  We build our products from a combination of commercially available parts and uniquely-designed manufactured parts.  The components are primarily manufactured by third parties.  Individual components such as printed circuit boards are manufactured and supplied by third parties.  We believe a low level of vertical integration gives us significant manufacturing and inventory flexibility and minimizes total product costs.  
 ﻿
 We purchase certain component parts and assemblies from single and multi-source suppliers.  With respect to the majority of our components, we believe that alternative suppliers could be found if existing suppliers could not ship to us. Many of our components are customized for our specific manufacturing needs.  Due to these specifications, various lead times would be required, based on the specific component that needed to be re-sourced. Component supply shortages in certain industries, including the electronics industry, have occurred in the past and are possible in the future due to imbalances in supply and demand.  We use global purchasing sources to minimize the risk of part shortages.  We have not experienced significant component supply shortages from single source suppliers in recent years. However, some of our suppliers have informed us that a few of our components are at “end-of-life” and so will be discontinued.  We are in the process of launching new products that will not require these “end of life” components.  Significant delays or interruptions in the delivery of components, assemblies or products by suppliers, or difficulties or delays in shifting manufacturing capacity to new suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on us.  
 ﻿

     ﻿
 There are a number of companies that sell similar and/or alternative technologies and methods into the same markets and regions as Perceptron. We believe there may be entities, some of which may be larger and have greater resources than we do, that could develop technology and products which could prove to be competitive with us.   We also believe that certain existing or potential customers may be capable of internally developing their own technology.  See Item 1A: “Risk Factors” titled “There are a number of companies offering competitive products in our markets, or developing products to compete with our products, which could result in a reduction in our revenues through lost sales or a reduction in prices”.
 ﻿
 Backlog
 ﻿
 As of June 30, 2017, we had a backlog of $45.0 million, compared to $38.4 million at June 30, 2016.  Most of our backlog is subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, often with limited or no penalties.  Historically, cancellations of orders once they have been booked have been very infrequent although several cancellations occurred during our fiscal year 2017.  The level of our backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of our future operating performance.  We expect to be able to fill substantially all of the orders in our backlog by June 30, 2018.
