Our Mission
Our mission is to improve the lives of families and caregivers by helping them connect in a reliable and easy way. Our solutions help families make informed decisions in one of the most important and highly considered aspects of their family life- finding and managing quality care for their family, their children, parents, pets and other loved ones. In providing families a comprehensive marketplace for care, we are building the largest destination for quality caregivers to find fulfilling employment and career opportunities globally. We strive to help our family and caregiver members pursue their passions and fulfill the basic human need of caring for each other.
Our Company
We are the world’s largest online marketplace for finding and managing family care. As of December 30, 2017, we had 27.3 million members, including 15.5 million families and 11.8 million caregivers, spanning more than 20 countries. We help families address their particular lifecycle of care needs, which includes child care, senior care, special needs care and other non-medical family care needs such as pet care, tutoring and housekeeping. In the process, we also help caregivers find rewarding full-time and part-time employment opportunities. In 2017, 57% of all job postings were for part-time care services, with the remaining 43% seeking full-time care. Examples of the various types of care services families find in our marketplace, depending on their diverse and evolving needs, include: 
•An experienced nanny to care for a new-born child and help with laundry;
•A daycare professional seeking to earn additional income by babysitting on occasional ‘‘date nights’’;

• | A college student helping to pay tuition by watching a 7 and 10-year old and assisting with after-school pick-ups, driving to activities, homework and meal preparation;


• | A retired nurse to drive an aging parent to routine medical appointments and assist with personal hygiene; and


• | A pet lover to take the family dog for her daily walk and care for her during family vacations.

We believe the scale and breadth of our services, combined with our commitment to delivering the best possible member experience for families and caregivers, have made us the most trusted and leading brand for finding and managing family care.
Our consumer matching solutions allow families to search for, connect with, qualify, vet, and ultimately select caregivers in a low-cost, reliable and easy way. We also provide caregivers with solutions to create personal profiles, describe their unique skills and experience, and otherwise differentiate and market themselves in a highly fragmented marketplace.
In addition to our consumer matching solutions, we offer our members innovative products and services to facilitate their interaction with caregivers. We provide solutions intended to improve both the ease and reliability of the care relationship in the home. One product area we are particularly focused on is our consumer payments solutions. Through Care.com HomePay, families can subscribe to payroll and tax preparation services for domestic employees. This offering deepens our relationship with our members and enhances the lifetime value associated with our members.
We also serve employers through our Care@Work offering by providing access to certain of our products and services, including back-up care for children and seniors to employer-sponsored families. In addition, we serve care-related businesses— such as day care centers, nanny agencies and home care agencies — who wish to market their services to our care-seeking families and recruit our caregiver members. These businesses improve our member experience by providing additional caregiving choices for families and employment opportunities for caregivers.
Our primary target market is women, who typically take the responsibility of making care decisions for their families-either as mothers or adult daughters-and are a majority of our caregivers. Women represent 94% of our caregivers and 81% of our care-seeking members. As a result of the shared characteristics of both sides of our marketplace, we are able to leverage our marketing investments targeted at families to also attract caregivers.

We have experienced steady growth in revenue and members. Our members increased to 27.3 million as of December 30, 2017 from 22.8 million as of December 31, 2016, representing a 20% annual growth rate. Our revenue has increased to $174.1 million in fiscal 2017 from $161.8 million in fiscal 2016, representing an 8% annual growth rate, primarily driven by our consumer matching solutions and consumer payment solutions, which we refer to as our U.S. Consumer Business, as well as our Care@Work employer solution. We experienced net income from continuing operations of $10.7 million in fiscal 2017 and a net loss from continuing operations of $0.7 million in fiscal 2016. We completed the closure of the Citrus Lane business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, and we had no income or losses from discontinued operations for fiscal 2017. In comparison, net income from discontinued operations was $7.8 million in fiscal 2016 due to a settlement agreement completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Refer to Note 3. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income (loss) from continuing operations, which excludes the accretion of preferred stock dividends and issuance costs, plus: federal, state and franchise taxes, other expense, net, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, accretion of contingent consideration, merger and acquisition related costs and other unusual or non-cash significant adjustments, such as impairment and restructuring charges, increased to income of $23.3 million from $13.4 million as of December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. See “Item 6, Selected Consolidated Financial Data” for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, a discussion of management’s use of this non-GAAP measure and the limitations of its use.
Our Market Opportunity 
The market for care is large and highly fragmented. According to IBISWorld market research, in 2017, an aggregate of over $330 billion was spent in the United States on care, including day care, in-home care providers, housekeepers, nursing care facilities, tutoring and pet care. We believe that our target market includes all households with income greater than $50,000 and 15% of households with income less than $50,000, in each case with either a child under the age of 18 or a senior over the age of 65. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 48 million such households in the United States in 2017. The needs of families seeking care are diverse, taking many different forms depending on the circumstances and life stage of the family. These needs include childcare, such as nannies and babysitters, in-home senior care, such as assistance with personal hygiene, meal preparation and transportation, and other family care needs, such as pet care, tutoring and housekeeping.
We believe that the following key trends contribute to the large and growing total addressable market for online care marketplaces:

• | Significant percentage of dual-income and single-parent households with children;

•Aging population with a high preference for in-home care;
•The growth in employer sponsored care services; and

• | Consumers increasingly using the internet and mobile devices for important and highly personal decisions and transactions.

Despite the size and growth of the care market, until the launch of Care.com, there had historically been no proven, efficient and cost-effective way for families to connect with quality caregivers and for caregivers or care-related businesses to target a large number of families.
Our Solutions 
Our Platform
Our platform features a portfolio of family care-related products and services for our members, including consumer matching services and consumer payments services. This breadth of offerings enables us to provide synergistic care-related solutions to our members, which we believe results in greater frequency of member engagement and higher lifetime value.
Our platform also enables caregivers to find jobs and manage their careers, employers to offer their employees valuable family care-related benefits that promote increased productivity, loyalty and reduced family care-related absences, and businesses to recruit employees and advertise their business profiles.
Efficient, Reliable and Affordable Way for Families and Caregivers to Connect and Manage Their Care and Career Needs
Our comprehensive and differentiated platform provides significant benefits to families seeking caregivers and caregivers seeking quality jobs, including:

• | Comprehensive solutions. We are the largest online marketplace for finding and managing family care. Through our platform, families have access to a broad range of solutions to address their diverse and evolving care needs, including childcare, housekeeping, pet care, senior care and tutoring. In addition, families can use our solutions for back-up care when primary care arrangements fall through. Similarly, caregivers can apply to jobs in any category of care posted by families or by care-related businesses. 


• | Efficient and reliable way for families to find quality caregivers. Our members have access to easy-to-use job posting tools, powerful search features and detailed caregiver profiles that are designed to allow them to efficiently navigate our 

3

vast database of individual caregivers and assess which caregivers best suit their needs. We also provide families with a comprehensive suite of tools and resources to help them make more informed decisions throughout the search and hiring process, including reviews, social connections, rate calculators, articles, an online safety center and access to a range of background checking services.

• | Efficient way for caregivers to target large, qualified audiences and professionalize their careers. Caregivers can easily create detailed profiles that include work history, education, credentials, reviews, social connections, third-party background check results and information about the specific care services they provide. In addition, we provide caregivers with services, educational resources and content to professionalize and manage their careers, as well as the opportunity to establish their professional reputation and enhance their profile through the reviews and ratings they receive from families. 


• | Cost-effective alternative. Families are provided access to search, post a job and preview detailed caregiver profiles. After an initial review of profiles, families have the option of selecting from a variety of affordable subscription plans to contact caregivers and access background checks. These subscriptions allow families to contact caregivers through our platform during the term of the subscription, including nannies, babysitters, pet sitters and tutors. Our caregiver members can apply to jobs through our platform and target families and care-related businesses. Caregivers have the option to pay for additional features such as priority notification of newly posted jobs. We are testing additional pricing and packaging offerings for families and caregivers that are designed to better meet the needs of the various segments that use Care.com and further monetize our services. 


• | Secure access anytime, anywhere. We provide a cross-platform suite of communication tools to enable easy and efficient communication between families and caregivers. Our services are available across multiple platforms and mobile devices to ensure that our members access Care.com easily and conveniently wherever they go. We provide our services through mobile apps on iOS and Android devices. We also make our website experience available on personal computers and mobile web browsers. Across these platforms, members are able to access our features for finding care and jobs and for paying caregivers. 

Easy-to-Use Payment Offerings
We provide Care.com HomePay, a suite of payroll and tax services for families that employ household workers. Unlike most other payroll and tax companies, Care.com HomePay caters only to households, whose needs are typically very different than those of businesses. As a result, our entire service is designed to meet the unique needs of family employers and has natural synergies with our consumer matching services. Care.com HomePay is not only designed to facilitate the management of a family’s financial relationship with a caregiver, but also to enable a caregiver to establish the compliance framework to qualify for important household employee benefits. We also provide a peer-to-peer payments service that enables families to make electronic payments to caregivers from a computer or mobile device.
Comprehensive Care Solution for Employers
We provide a comprehensive suite of care services for employers to offer to their employees, including our consumer matching solutions, payment offerings, back-up care services and care concierge services. In addition to helping employees better manage the balance between work and home life, these services are designed to benefit employers by promoting increased productivity, engagement, loyalty and reduced care-related absences.
Efficient Marketing and Recruiting Channel for Care-Related Businesses
We provide a highly targeted suite of marketing and recruiting solutions for care-related businesses. These solutions enable care-related businesses to advertise their business profiles to families seeking care and to post care jobs and search our database of caregivers seeking employment.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and contribute to our success:
Largest Global Marketplace Focused on Care
We are the world’s largest online marketplace for finding and managing family care with 27.3 million members, including 15.5 million families and 11.8 million caregivers, spanning more than 20 countries. Since the launch of our marketplace in 2007, we estimate, based on internal member data, that over 1.5 million matches between families and caregivers have taken place through our service in the areas of child care, senior care, special needs care, tutoring, pet care, and housekeeping. 
High Member Satisfaction Rates
4

We believe our breadth of selection and our matching algorithms enhance the effectiveness of our marketplace and the value we offer to both families and caregivers. Furthermore, our surveys indicate that families who hire caregivers using our consumer matching solutions have a high degree of satisfaction with the caregivers they find.
Powerful Network Effects
We benefit from significant network effects as the market leader in the highly fragmented and growing market for finding family care online. As more families use our services, we attract more caregivers seeking a large pool of families in need of caregiver services. Similarly, the increasing number of caregivers using our services has attracted more families. This cycle has driven more and more people to use our services and has resulted in a significant percentage of our new members coming from unpaid sources.
Growing and Engaged Membership
Over the last nine years, we have expanded from 500,000 members to 27.3 million members. As we grow our membership, improve the member experience and offer additional products and features, more members are using our services for longer periods of time. This highly engaged membership helps improve the effectiveness of our services and increases the lifetime value of our members. 
Trusted and Recognized Brand
We have invested in building a differentiated member experience for finding and managing care. This investment includes the ongoing prioritization of features and processes that we believe contribute to the quality of our marketplace. Examples of these investments include the review of all job and profile postings for suspicious or inappropriate content, tools for members to review and report other members, a monitored messaging system that allows members to communicate without sharing their personal contact information, the proactive screening of certain member information against various databases and other sources for criminal or other inappropriate activity, the use of technology to help identify and prevent inappropriate activity through our platform and a safety center that provides resources and information designed to help families and caregivers make more informed hiring and job selection decisions
We believe these product investments, combined with our investments in national brand advertising and our domain name itself, have established the Care.com brand as a leading and trusted brand for finding care.
Our Growth Strategy
Attract More Members to Our Platform
In order to grow our membership, we intend to increase the visibility of our services, platform and brand awareness among families and caregivers through our investments in various marketing channels, such as television, online advertising and direct marketing. These investments also include initiatives such as search engine optimization, content development, data journalism, and community groups and forums, which are designed to increase the visibility of our services in organic search result listings and social media channels. In addition, we intend to attract more members to our platform, through our continuous investments in improving product experience. 
Increase Revenue
As we improve our user experience and expand our product and service offerings, we have seen an increase in revenue from our member base. We intend to further increase revenue from our member base by continuing these investments in user experience and new products and services, as well as optimizing the monetization of our products and services, especially on mobile devices. In addition, we intend to further engage our non-paying members by expanding our community and content features, so that we remain top of mind when these non-paying members have a need for our products and services.  We believe increasing engagement of our members will drive higher conversion of non-paying members to paying members, longer average length of paid time, and greater adoption of new products and services.
Expand and Increase Adoption of Our Care@Work and Payments Offerings 
We believe there is significant opportunity for us to continue to grow our Care@Work offering.  We intend to do this by continuing to promote a comprehensive suite of services to the growing number of employers who are providing family care-related benefits to their employees, including back-up care services for children and elder-care when primary care falls through, and by product and service innovation.
We also believe there is significant opportunity for us to grow our consumer payments solutions.  An increasing number of Care.com members are using our household employer payroll and tax product, Care.com HomePay (formerly Breedlove & Associates, L.L.C.).  We expect this trend to continue by, among other things, further integrating our consumer matching and payment solutions.

Grow Our International Business
We believe the global secular trends of an increasing number of dual-income households with children, and an aging population, provide significant growth opportunities outside the United States. The majority of our international business today occurs in Western Europe, the market served by our Berlin-based subsidiary Care.com Europe GmbH (formerly Besser Betreut GmbH or Betreut) or Care.com Europe. We are currently operating in more than 20 countries. We intend to grow our international business by leveraging our learnings from our U.S. consumer matching solutions, such as investing in organic marketing and other efficient marketing channels, expanding our product and service offerings, optimizing the monetization of our products and services, and selective expansion to new countries.
Selectively Pursue Acquisitions and Strategic Relationships 
We will continue to explore opportunities to acquire companies that complement our existing business, enhance the user experience of our services, represent a strong cultural fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy. In addition, we may enter into various strategic relationships to provide a more comprehensive offering to our members.
Our Products and Services
Our consumer products and services are designed to make it easier for families to find and manage quality caregivers and for caregivers to find satisfying jobs and manage their careers. We also offer products and services that allow families to share experiences and request advice. Additionally, we offer services to employers and care-related businesses that are designed to benefit those organizations as well as our family and caregiver members. 
U.S. Consumer Business
Consumer Matching Solutions
Matching the right caregiver with the right family can create tremendous value for our members. Our innovative consumer matching solutions and large member base facilitate quality matches for the diverse and evolving needs of our members. Some of the features and tools we offer to families and caregivers are offered at no cost, others are bundled into one or more subscription packages. In addition, some features and tools are offered on an à la carte basis. Most of our tools and features are accessible on both mobile devices and personal computers.
Tools and Features for Families

• | Job Posting. Families quickly and easily post a detailed job description specifying their care need (e.g., nanny, babysitter, senior care support, tutor, housekeeper, pet sitter, etc.), the frequency, hourly rate, responsibilities and other requirements for the job and any other relevant information they choose to provide. 


• | Search. Families search for potential caregivers based on specific search criteria such as type of care provided, location, hourly rate, whether the caregiver has their own transportation or smokes, comfort with pets and willingness to accept non-cash payments and/or have taxes withheld. The initial search results are based on an algorithm we designed to highlight the most relevant caregivers, but a family can also sort the search results by additional criteria, such as distance from the family, experience, availability, membership length or age. 


• | Detailed Caregiver Profiles. Families review detailed information about the caregivers who apply to their jobs or appear in their search results. This detailed information includes a bio, work history, the type of care they provide, any additional services they provide (such as laundry, grocery shopping and errands), their experience, certifications and qualifications (such as college degree and CPR training or other languages spoken), their availability and hourly rate, the types of payments they accept, whether they are willing to have taxes withheld, caregiver reviews from other members, a caregiver’s verifications, any shared social connections, and any other relevant information the caregiver chooses to provide. Caregivers also have the option of including a photo or a video with their profile. 


• | Messaging. Members may use our messaging system to contact caregivers who have applied to their jobs or appeared in their search results. Because this messaging system is internal to Care.com, members do not have to disclose personal contact or other information to communicate through this system. When a family sends a message to a caregiver through our messaging system, we also send an email to the caregiver’s personal email and an alert to their mobile device (if they have installed our mobile app) to notify them that a family has sent them a message. 


• | Background Check Services. We currently offer multiple levels of background checks from consumer credit reporting agencies that families may request on caregivers they are interested in hiring. Caregivers must accept the background checks request from a family before the background check is performed.

Tools and Features for Caregivers

• | Profile. Caregivers create and post detailed profiles that include their bio, work history and reviews, the type of care they provide, any additional services they provide (such as laundry, grocery shopping and errands), their experience, certifications and qualifications (such as college degree and CPR training or other languages spoken), their availability and hourly rate, the types of payments they accept, whether they are willing to have taxes withheld and any other relevant information they choose to provide. To build their credibility with families, caregivers may elect to verify their phone number and email addresses with us and connect to other members. Caregivers also have the option of including a photo or a video with their profile. 


• | Search. Caregivers search for specific jobs posted by families, as well as for families based on specific search criteria such as type of care needed, location, hourly rate and number and age of children. 


• | Apply. Caregivers can review and apply to jobs that interest them. When a caregiver applies to a job, the family is notified of the new applicant by email, SMS text message or a mobile alert. 


• | Messaging. Caregivers can respond to messages from families using our internal messaging system. Based on the caregiver’s subscription package, the caregiver may also initiate contact with a family. 


• | Background Check Services. Caregivers may elect to have a background check run on themselves. We currently offer multiple levels of background checks from consumer credit reporting agencies that caregivers may request on themselves. 

Additional Tools and Features for Families and Caregivers

• | Mobile Apps. Families and caregivers can download our free mobile apps for iOS and Android. These apps provide families and caregivers the same job posting, profile creation, search and messaging features described above. 


• | Safety Center. Our service features a safety center that provides resources and information designed to help families and caregivers make safer and more informed hiring and job selection decisions, including recommendations to families for screening, interviewing and ongoing monitoring of caregivers and recommendations to caregivers for avoiding scams. Members may also contact our member care department directly by phone or email if they have concerns about other members. We also offer an online tool that allows families and caregivers to report other members. 


• | Email Notifications. Families may receive weekly emails highlighting new caregivers near them, and caregivers may receive daily emails notifying them of new jobs in their area. We send families and caregivers additional email communications to help them maximize their use of our consumer matching solutions and to inform them of additional products or services that may be appropriate for them. 


• | Access to professional benefits for caregivers. We provide a peer-to-peer benefits platform between families and caregivers, which enables families to contribute to their caregiver’s benefits just as traditional corporate employers do for their employees. When a family pays a caregiver through Care.com, a percentage of the transaction is added to the payment to fund the Care.com Benefits program, which helps the caregiver pay for essential family expenses, such as healthcare and transportation. These contributions are pooled with others from household employers paying that caregiver through Care.com. From the program, caregivers receive Care Benefit Bucks, which provide access to benefits that are portable – staying with the care worker even if she changes jobs working for numerous families on Care.com. 

Consumer Payments Solutions
Our consumer payments solutions provide families several options to manage their financial relationship with their caregiver. These products also help caregivers professionalize and manage their careers.

• | Household Employer Payroll and Tax Services. Care.com HomePay is our payroll and tax product for families that employ nannies, housekeepers or other domestic employees. Care.com HomePay is a technology-based, turnkey service that includes automated payroll processing and household employer-related tax filings at the federal, state and local levels. In addition, caregivers who are paid through Care.com HomePay may qualify for important benefits such as unemployment insurance and social security. For household employers who only require an automated payroll processing solution, we offer this service separately. In the future, we intend to offer additional payroll and tax services at tiered feature and pricing levels to address a range of market needs. These products are available to anyone, not just paying members of our consumer matching solutions. 


• | Peer-to-peer Payments. This offering enables families to make electronic payments to their caregivers using our website or mobile apps. This solution is particularly applicable for families who pay their caregivers at irregular intervals, such as babysitters, after-school caregivers or tutors, or in varying amounts each time services are performed.

Solutions for Employers via Care@Work 
We provide a comprehensive suite of services that employers can offer their employees as an employee benefit. Currently, employers can choose from a number of services, including:

• | Our consumer matching solutions;


• | Back-up care services for employees needing alternative care arrangements for their child or senior due to events such as school closure or the illness of their child or regular caregiver;


• | Care concierge services, which include senior care planning services to assist employees struggling to understand their options for an aging family member as well as hands-on assistance with the caregiver search process; and


• | Our consumer payment solutions.

Employers generally pay for these services on a per employee per year basis and have access to features that allow them to manage employee access and track aggregate usage. Depending on the service and the employer’s preference, the employer may subsidize all, a portion, or none of the service cost for the employee.
Solutions for Care-Related Businesses 
We offer care-related businesses a recruiting solution to help them more effectively recruit caregivers and a marketing solution to help them target families at scale. These solutions also provide additional caregiving choices for families and employment opportunities for caregivers.

• | Recruiting Solutions. Through this offering, businesses can either post jobs or search for candidates directly from our base of caregivers. Businesses pay us either a per job listing fee for each job posted each month or obtain a subscription fee that ranges in duration from monthly to annual. 


• | Marketing Solutions. Through this offering, businesses can list their services on our website, receive referrals and apply to jobs posted by families. Businesses typically pay us either a referral fee for each lead generated through our site or a subscription that ranges in duration from three months to annual. 

Community Platform and Tools
We operate a community and content platform with features such as groups, forums, articles, and resources for families and caregivers. Our platform is used to host and manage some of the largest parenting and family groups in the United States. Parents regularly engage in these groups to request parenting advice and share their experiences with other group members.
Our Technology
Our technology platform is designed to provide an efficient marketplace experience across our website and mobile apps. Our solution is based on stable and mature technology frameworks that allow us to rapidly scale as our business grows. Key elements of our technology solution include:

• | Powerful Search and Ranking. Our search technology has been designed to handle rapid and continuous growth in search queries and members. Our technology enables families and caregivers to run faceted and free-form search queries and receive results ranked by relevance using our sorting algorithm. Members can run searches based on a variety of parameters, including location, type of care, hours of availability and hourly rate. 


• | Targeting. We employ statistical models and algorithms to ensure that we are managing the efficiency of our marketplace and optimizing the experience for both families and caregivers. These models are used to improve our customer acquisition efforts as well as our product experience and leverage our rich and growing data set. For example, we prioritize the order in which caregivers are presented to a family to give more prominence to caregivers we believe are more appropriate for the family based on their profile, job postings, and/or usage of our services. Similarly, we present caregivers with job opportunities that we feel are best suited to their qualifications and interests. We also employ targeting technology to personalize the content that we display for members as they use our website and mobile apps. We refine the techniques we use for targeting on an ongoing basis. 


• | Mobile Solutions. We offer mobile apps designed specifically for the iOS and Android operating systems. In addition, we also provide a mobile optimized website. These mobile solutions are built on an interface layer that exposes the core features of our service. We use the same interface layer across all of our mobile solutions and believe this architecture will allow us to easily expand our services to new devices and mobile platforms in the future. 


• | Testing and Optimization. We have developed a solution for testing and optimizing the user experience and member engagement on our websites and in our email communications. This solution allows us to run multiple variations of a service feature or email tactic simultaneously and is supported by robust data collection and reporting. Based on our 

8

analysis of the user response to a given test, we are able to dynamically send more users to the experience that produces a better result.

• | Infrastructure Management. We have developed a proprietary suite of tools for managing, administering and monitoring our production website and mobile app platforms. These tools are used to streamline the deployment of releases and to help ensure high availability of our consumer-facing service. 

Our Customers
Our customers are our family and caregiver members, including members who utilize our HomePay services, employers who offer our services as an employee benefit and care-related businesses who subscribe to our marketing and/or our recruiting solutions offerings.
The typical care seeker for our U.S. Consumer Business is female (81%), has an average household income of $75,000, and has at least one child under 18 in the house (68%). Our typical caregiver is also female (94%) and well educated (61% indicating they have at least some college education). Currently, we have 27.3 million members of which 57% represents families and 43% represents caregivers. We have families in approximately 96% of U.S. zip codes and caregivers in approximately 91% of U.S. zip codes. Our members are in every state, and the geographic distribution of our members by state is roughly equal to the overall population distribution by state.
In addition, we have a diverse range of employers who offer our services as a benefit to their employees, including technology companies, educational institutions, professional services firms and Fortune 500 companies. As of December 30, 2017, these employers employed over 1.3 million employees who have full access to some or all of our services.
Additionally, we have a diverse set of local, regional and national child care, senior care and other care-related businesses that use our services to help either find people who need the care they provide or find caregivers to work at their organization.
Our Competition
With respect to our consumer matching solutions, we compete for members with traditional offline consumer resources, online job boards and other online care marketplaces. We also compete for a share of the overall recruiting and advertising budgets of care-related businesses with traditional, offline media companies and other Internet marketing providers. The principal competitive factors in this market include:
•network size and quality of caregivers and families;
•product reliability, features, effectiveness and efficiency;
•the quality and completeness of family job postings and caregiver profiles;
•product line breadth and applicability;
•affordability and value of the products provided;
•reliability of safety and security measures;
•the performance and reliability of a mobile solution;
•international footprint; and
•brand awareness and reputation.
Our principal competitors in this market are other online care marketplaces, such as Sittercity and UrbanSitter, and online classifieds, such as Craigslist. Our principal competitor in our employer channel is Bright Horizons. In the consumer payments market, Care.com HomePay competes with similar products offered by HomeWork Solutions, Inc. and GTM Payroll Services. We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of our scale, trusted brand and member experience.
Marketing and Sales 
Our marketing strategy is focused on attracting families and caregivers to our marketplace. Our marketing efforts are designed to increase brand awareness, maximize reach and penetration and grow our member base. Marketing activities include demand generation, advertising, conferences, press relations and customer awareness.
Our target market is primarily women on both sides of the marketplace. Women are typically the primary care decision makers for their family-either as mothers or adult daughters-and represent 94% of our caregivers and 81% of our families. As a result of the shared characteristics of both sides of our marketplace, we are able to leverage our marketing investments targeted at families to also attract caregivers, resulting in lower acquisition costs for caregivers.
9

We acquire consumers through a diverse mix of free and paid acquisition channels. As a result of our strong focus on our member experience and engagement to ensure a successful match for families and caregivers, the majority of our new subscribers come from unpaid channels, including word-of-mouth referrals, SEO, online communities and forums and repeat users.
Our paid direct marketing efforts for both families and caregivers comprise both offline channels such as network cable TV, local radio and direct mail and online channels such as SEM, paid social display ads, affiliates and select paid job board sites. Our marketing spend is weighted towards our high seasons based on the timing of demand from families seeking care.
Our sales organization is responsible for attracting and retaining employers and care-related businesses to grow adoption of our services and offerings to those organizations. We expect to continue to grow our sales headcount to grow these channels.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses totaled $25.4 million, $20.4 million, and $19.8 million for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015, respectively. Please refer to Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further detail on our research and development expenses.
Government Regulation
We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state, and foreign laws and regulations that affect consumer-based businesses and companies that conduct business on the Internet. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy, information security and data protection, obtaining and use of consumer background information, intellectual property, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, marketing and advertising, telecommunications, taxation, securities law compliance, and online payment services, among other things. 
For example, in the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the Massachusetts Data Breach Notification Law, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. In addition, our operations subject us to certain payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, a security standard with which companies that collect, store or transmit certain data regarding credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders, and credit and debit card transactions are required to comply. Our failure to comply fully with the PCI DSS may violate payment card association operating rules, federal and state laws and regulations, and the terms of our contracts with payment processors, merchant banks or other parties.
In addition, in the United States we acquire consumer background information about our members from consumer credit reporting agencies, which subjects us to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or the FCRA. Among other things, the FCRA limits the distribution and use of consumer reports and establishes consumer rights to access and dispute their own credit files, among other rights and obligations. Violation of the FCRA can result in civil and criminal penalties. Many states have enacted laws with requirements similar to the FCRA. Some of these laws impose additional, or more stringent, requirements than the FCRA.
Also, we offer members a paid subscription service that auto-renews until downgraded to a non-paying membership. Many states have enacted laws specific to auto-renewing contracts. Among other things, these laws may require specific notifications to consumers prior to and/or after a consumer agrees to an auto-renewing contract, and may specify the manner in which such notifications are given. Violation of a state auto-renew law can result in civil penalties and in many instances renders the contract unenforceable, which could result in a refund of all fees paid under the contract. 
Because our services are accessible worldwide, we are also subject to a number of laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, in some cases, a foreign jurisdiction may claim that we are required to comply with its laws even if we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure in that jurisdiction.
U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate. If we are not in compliance with existing or new laws or regulations that are applicable to our business or if new or existing laws or regulations are interpreted and applied inconsistently with our current policies and practices, our business could be harmed, and we may be forced to modify our policies and practices.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with our employees and certain consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. We do not have any patents or pending patent applications.

We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States when we deem such registration to be beneficial and appropriate. 
The efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. In addition, Internet, technology and social media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may in the future receive notices asserting that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated a third party’s intellectual property rights, and as we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows.
Employees
We believe we have assembled a talented group of employees and strive to hire the best employees. As of December 30, 2017, we had 428 full-time employees and 321 part-time employees, not including approximately 142 part-time caregiver employees of our subsidiary Care Concierge, Inc. (“Care Concierge”), who provide back-up care from time to time. None of our employees is represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. We have never had a work stoppage, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Operating Segments and Geographic Areas
We manage our business under one operating segment. The majority of our revenue in the year-ended December 30, 2017 was from paying members in the United States.
