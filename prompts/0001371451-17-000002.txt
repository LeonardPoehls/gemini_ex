ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Development
Highwater Ethanol, LLC (“we,” “our,” “Highwater Ethanol” or the “Company”) was formed as a Minnesota limited liability company on May 2, 2006 for the purpose of constructing, owning, and operating a 50 million gallon per year ethanol plant near Lamberton, Minnesota. Since August 2009, we have been engaged in the production of ethanol and distillers grains at the plant. We have been operating at an annual rate of approximately 59 million gallons for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 and anticipate we will continue to operate in this range in the future. 

During our fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, we commenced a project to install a water pipeline to add a third water source for our plant. In connection with the installation of the pipeline, we contracted with DGR Engineering to provide engineering and oversight for the construction of this water pipeline and executed construction agreements with three contractors, including Rice Lake Construction Group, to construct the project. The project was completed during the first quarter of our 2016 fiscal year. The final project cost was approximately $5,300,000. We also commenced a construction project to add 600,000 bushels of additional grain storage during our fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. This project was completed during the third quarter of our 2016 fiscal year at a cost of approximately $1,900,000. In addition, we installed a precondenser which has had a positive affect on ethanol yields. The precondenser became operational during the second quarter of our 2016 fiscal year at a cost of approximately $1,100,000. These projects were funded with our existing credit facilities and cash generated from operations.
On November 18, 2015, the board of governors declared a cash distribution of $400 per membership unit for the holders of units of record at the close of business on that date for a total distribution of $1,974,400. We paid the distribution on December 17, 2015. Subsequent to the fiscal year end, on December 7, 2016, the board of governors declared a cash distribution of $345 per membership unit for the holders of units of record at the close of business on that date for a total distribution of $1,687,740. We paid the distribution on December 15, 2016.
On January 22, 2016, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with AgStar Financial Services, PCA ("AgStar") which amended our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated September 22, 2014. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a Term Loan and a Term Revolving Loan and is secured by substantially all business assets. In connection therewith, effective the same date, we executed Second Amended and Restated Term Notes, Second Amended and Restated Term Revolving Notes, an Amended and Restated Security Agreement and a Second Amended and Restated Mortgage, Security Agreement, Assignment of Leases and Fixture Financing Statement. Please refer to “ITEM 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a detailed description of our debt financing.

Principal Products
The principal products we currently produce at the ethanol plant are fuel-grade ethanol and distillers grains. In addition, we are extracting corn oil for sale. The table below shows the approximate percentage of our total revenue which is attributed to each of our products for each of our last three fiscal years.

Product | Fiscal Year 2016 | | Fiscal Year 2015 | | Fiscal Year 2014
Ethanol | 79 | % | | 78 | % | 80 | %
Distillers Grains | 18 | % | | 19 | % | 19 | %
Corn Oil | 3 | % | | 3 | % | 1 | %

Ethanol
Our primary product is ethanol. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains. The ethanol we produce is manufactured from corn. Although the ethanol industry continues to explore production technologies employing various feedstocks, such as biomass, corn-based production technologies remain the most practical and
provide the lowest operating risks. Corn produces large quantities of carbohydrates, which convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass. The Renewable Fuels Association estimates current capacity for domestic ethanol production at approximately 15.8 billion gallons as of December 1, 2016 with approximately 3% of that capacity idled.
An ethanol plant is essentially a fermentation plant. Ground corn and water are mixed with enzymes and yeast to produce a substance called “beer,” which contains about 10% alcohol and 90% water. The “beer” is boiled to separate the water, resulting in ethyl alcohol, which is then dehydrated to increase the alcohol content. This product is then mixed with a certified denaturant to make the product unfit for human consumption and commercially saleable. 
Ethanol can be used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute. Approximately 95% of all ethanol is used in its primary form for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products. Used as a fuel oxygenate, ethanol provides a means to control carbon monoxide emissions in large metropolitan areas. The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally the wholesale gasoline marketer or blender.
Distillers Grains
The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein, high-energy animal feed supplement primarily marketed to the dairy, poultry, swine and beef industries. Dry mill ethanol processing creates three forms of distiller grains: Distillers Wet Grains with Solubles (“DWS”), Distillers Modified Wet Grains with Solubles (“DMWS”) and Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (“DDGS”). DWS is processed corn mash that contains approximately 70% moisture. DWS has a shelf life of approximately three days and can be sold only to farms within the immediate vicinity of an ethanol plant. DMWS is DWS that has been dried to approximately 50% moisture. DMWS has a slightly longer shelf life of approximately ten days and is often sold to nearby markets. DDGS is DWS that has been dried to between 10% and 12% moisture. DDGS has an almost indefinite shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market regardless of its vicinity to an ethanol plant.
Corn Oil

Since April 2014, we have been separating some of the corn oil contained in our distillers grains for sale. The corn oil that we produce is not food grade corn oil and therefore cannot be used for human consumption. However, corn oil can be used as the feedstock to produce biodiesel, as a feed ingredient and has other industrial uses.
Ethanol, Distillers Grains and Corn Oil Markets
As described below in “Distribution Methods” we market and distribute a majority of our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil through professional third party marketers. Our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil marketers make decisions with regard to where our products are marketed. 
Our ethanol and distillers grains are primarily sold in the domestic market, however, as domestic production of ethanol and distillers grains continue to expand, we anticipate increased international sales of ethanol and distillers grains. However, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a majority of our products to continue to be marketed and sold domestically.
Over the past fiscal year, exports of ethanol have increased with Canada, China and Brazil receiving the largest percentage of ethanol produced in the United States. India, the Philippines and South Korea have also been top destinations. Ethanol exports could continue to increase in the future if market conditions are favorable. However, export demand is unpredictable.
5

The United States ethanol industry exported a significant amount of distillers grains to China and Mexico over the past fiscal year with South Korea and Vietnam receiving notable amounts. However, exports of distillers grains weakened during this past fiscal year. Earlier this year, China began an antidumping and countervailing duty investigation related to distillers grains imported from the United States which contributed to a decline in distillers grains shipped to China. Recently, China issued a preliminary ruling on the anti-dumping investigation imposing an immediate duty on distillers grains that are produced in the United States. In addition, China implemented an anti-subsidy duty which was implemented as of September 30, 2016. The imposition of these duties are expected to result in a further decline in demand from this top importer requiring United States producers to seek out alternatives markets. 
All of the corn oil we produce is marketed and distributed in the domestic market.
Distribution Methods
Ethanol
We have an exclusive marketing agreement with RPMG, Inc. (“RPMG”) for the purposes of marketing and distributing our ethanol. Because we are an owner of Renewable Products Marketing Group, LLC (“RPMG LLC”), the parent entity of RPMG, our ethanol marketing fees are based on RPMG's cost to market our ethanol. Further, as an owner, we share in the profits and losses generated by RPMG when it markets products for other producers who are not owners of RPMG LLC. Our marketing agreement provides that we can sell our ethanol either through an index arrangement or at an agreed upon fixed price. The term of our marketing agreement is perpetual until terminated according to its terms. The primary reasons for termination would be if we cease to be an owner of RPMG LLC, if there is a breach which is not cured, or if we give advance notice to RPMG that we wish to terminate. Notwithstanding our right to terminate, we may be obligated to continue to market our ethanol through RPMG for a period of time after termination. Further, following termination, we agree to accept an assignment of certain railcar leases which RPMG has secured to service us. If the marketing agreement is terminated, it would trigger a redemption of our ownership interest in RPMG LLC. 
Distillers Grains
We have a distillers grains marketing agreement with CHS, Inc. ("CHS") to market all the dried distillers grains we produce at the plant. Under the agreement, CHS charges a maximum of $2.00 per ton and a minimum of $1.50 per ton price using 2% of the FOB plant price actually received by CHS for all dried distillers grains removed by CHS from our plant. The agreement will remain in effect unless otherwise terminated by either party with 120 days notice. Under the agreement, CHS is responsible for all transportation arrangements for the distribution of our dried distillers grains. We market and sell our own distillers modified wet grains with solubles.
Corn Oil
We have a corn oil marketing agreement with CHS wherein CHS purchases all crude corn oil produced at the plant. CHS pays the actual price that CHS receives from its buyers less a marketing fee, actual freight and transportation costs and certain taxes related to the purchase, delivery or sale of the corn oil. The agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless terminated by either party in accordance with its terms. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
Corn Feedstock Supply
The major raw material required for our ethanol plant to produce ethanol and distillers grains is corn. To produce 50 million gallons of ethanol per year, our ethanol plant needs approximately 18.5 million bushels of corn per year, or approximately 50,000 bushels of corn per day, as the feedstock for its dry milling process. 
Until July of 2016, we procured corn from Meadowland Farmers Co-op (“Meadowland”) pursuant to a procurement agreement where Meadowland had the exclusive right and responsibility to provide us with our daily requirements of corn meeting quality specifications set forth in the grain procurement agreement. Under the agreement, we purchased corn at the local market price delivered to the plant plus a fixed fee per bushel of corn purchased. This agreement expired according to its terms in July 2016. 
Since July 2016, we have procured corn from CHS pursuant to a grain origination agreement (the "CHS Agreement"). In that agreement, we agreed to buy from CHS all of our daily requirements for feedstock grain meeting certain specifications. 
6

The CHS Agreement runs for an initial five-year term which commenced on July 27, 2016. The CHS Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms. The CHS Agreement may also be terminated in the event of a breach by either party after a thirty-day notice of the breach and opportunity to cure. Under the CHS Agreement, we will notify CHS of our grain requirements, including volume and delivery dates, on or before the first and fifteenth day of each month. We will then provide to CHS a daily bid sheet for grain to be sold to the Company and CHS shall purchase the grain by separate purchase contracts at the basis prices, quantities and guidelines identified in the bid sheet using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the lowest price available. All sales of grain by CHS will be done by separate sales contracts requiring delivery of grain to the Company at the facility. We will pay CHS the CBOT futures price less the weighted average of the basis prices plus a fixed fee per bushel of grain purchased. 
The price at which we purchase corn depends on prevailing market prices. Increases in the price of corn significantly increase our cost of goods sold. If these increases in cost of goods sold are not offset by corresponding increases in the prices we receive from the sale of our products, these increases in cost of goods sold can have a significant negative impact on our financial performance. Corn prices were lower during our 2016 fiscal year compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to a large 2015 corn crop which increased domestic corn supply and resulted in a larger carryover and anticipated reduced demand for corn due to the lower renewable volume obligations released by the EPA in November 2015. 
On November 9, 2016, the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") released a report estimating the 2016 corn crop at 15.2 billion bushels, up 12% from last year's production, with yields averaging 175.3 bushels per acre. The USDA forecasted area harvested for grain at 86.8 million acres, up 8% from 2015. As a result, management expects that corn prices will remain lower through the winter of 2016. However, weather, world supply and demand, current and anticipated stocks, agricultural policy and other factors can contribute to volatility in corn prices. If corn prices rise, it will have a negative effect on our operating margins unless the price of ethanol and distillers grains out paces rising corn prices. 
Utilities
Natural Gas
Natural gas is an important input to our manufacturing process. We use natural gas to dry our distillers grains products to moisture contents at which they can be stored for longer periods. This allows the distillers grains we produce to be transported greater distances to serve broader livestock markets. 

We have access to an existing Northern Natural Gas interstate natural gas pipeline located approximately one half mile from our ethanol plant. We entered into a natural gas service agreement with CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp., d.b.a. CenterPoint Energy Minnesota Gas (“CenterPoint”). CenterPoint constructed for us a pipeline from the Northern Natural Gas Company (“Northern”) Town Border Station. We purchase all of our natural gas requirements from CenterPoint's pipeline. This agreement will continue until October 31, 2019.
We also have an energy management agreement with U.S. Energy Services, Inc. (“US Energy”) pursuant to which US Energy is providing us with the necessary natural gas management services. Some of their services may include an economic comparison of distribution service options, negotiation and minimization of interconnect costs, submission of the necessary pipeline “tap” request, supplying the plant with and/or negotiating the procurement of natural gas, development and implementation of a price risk management plan targeted at mitigating natural gas price volatility and maintaining profitability, providing consolidated monthly invoices that reflect all natural gas costs. In addition, US Energy is responsible for reviewing and reconciling all invoices. In exchange for these services, we pay US Energy a monthly retainer fee. 
We do not anticipate any problems securing the natural gas we need to operate our ethanol plant during our 2017 fiscal year. 
Electricity
On June 28, 2007, we entered into an agreement for electric service with Redwood Electric Cooperative, Inc., (“Redwood”) for the purchase and delivery of electric power and energy necessary to operate our ethanol plant. In exchange for its services, we pay Redwood a monthly facilities charge of approximately $12,000 plus Redwood's standard electrical rates. In addition, we agreed that in the event our ethanol plant does not continue to be operational for the entire term of the contract, we will reimburse Redwood for its expenses related to the installation of the facilities necessary to supply our electrical needs. Upon execution of the agreement, we became a member of Redwood and are bound by its articles of incorporation and bylaws. This agreement will remain in effect for 10 years following the initial billing period. In the event we wish to continue receiving electrical service from Redwood beyond the 10 year period, we will need to enter into a new agreement with Redwood at least one year prior to the 
7

expiration of the initial 10 year period. If the agreement is terminated by either party for any reason prior to the expiration of the initial ten year period, we will be required to pay for the entire amount of the facility charge for the remainder of the initial ten year period. We do not anticipate any problems securing the electricity we need to operate our ethanol plant during our 2017 fiscal year. 
Water
We require a significant supply of water. We currently obtain water from a high capacity well. However, during our 2015 fiscal year, we commenced a project to install a water pipeline to add an additional water source for our plant. This project was completed during the first quarter of our 2016 fiscal year. We acquired all of the necessary permits required for our water usage. Much of the water used in an ethanol plant is recycled back into the process. There are, however, certain areas of production where fresh water is needed. Those areas include the boiler makeup water and cooling tower water. Boiler makeup water is treated on-site to minimize all elements that will harm the boiler and recycled water cannot be used for this process. Cooling tower water is deemed non-contact water because it does not come in contact with the mash, and, therefore, can be regenerated back into the cooling tower process. The makeup water requirements for the cooling tower are primarily a result of evaporation. Much of our water can be recycled back into the process, which minimizes the discharge water. We expect this will have the long-term effect of lowering wastewater treatment costs. We have assessed our water needs and determined we have an adequate supply.    
Research and Development
We continually conduct research and development activities associated with the development of new technologies for use in producing ethanol and distillers grains and the potential for implementation of biobutanol technology and commercial-scale production of biobutanol at our facility. We incurred costs associated with these activities for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
We do not currently hold any patents, trademarks, franchises or concessions. We were granted a license by ICM, Inc. to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our ethanol plant. The cost of the license granted by ICM, Inc. was included in the amount we paid to Fagen, Inc. to design and build our ethanol plant. We were granted a license by Butamax Advanced Biofuels, LLC ("Butamax") to use certain corn oil separation technology in exchange for payment of certain license fees which are subject to being reduced under the terms of the Agreements if the corn oil separation system does not meet certain performance goals.
Seasonality Sales
We experience some seasonality of demand for our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving and, as a result, increased gasoline demand. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. We also experience decreased distillers grains demand during the summer months due to natural depletion in the size of herds at cattle feed lots and when the animals are turned out to pasture or are slaughtered. Further, we expect some seasonality of demand for our corn oil since a major corn oil user is biodiesel plants which typically reduce production during the winter months. 
Working Capital
We primarily use our working capital for purchases of raw materials necessary to operate the ethanol plant. Our primary sources of working capital are cash generated by our operations and our Term Revolving Loan with AgStar. At October 31, 2016, we had approximately $9,500,000 available to draw on our Term Revolving Loan. 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
As discussed above, we have a marketing agreement with RPMG for the marketing, sale and distribution of our ethanol and have engaged CHS for marketing, selling and distributing our distillers dried grains with solubles and corn oil. We expect to rely on RPMG for the sale and distribution of our ethanol and CHS for the sale and distribution of our distillers dried grains with solubles and corn oil. Therefore, although there are other marketers in the industry, we are highly dependent on RPMG and CHS for the successful marketing of our products. Any loss of RPMG or CHS as our marketing agents could have a significant negative impact on our revenues. We market and sell our own distillers modified wet grains.

Federal Ethanol Supports and Governmental Regulation
Federal Ethanol Supports 
The ethanol industry is dependent on economic incentives to produce ethanol. One significant federal ethanol support is the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the “RFS”). The RFS requires that in each year, a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective. The RFS statutory volume requirement increases incrementally each year until the United States is required to use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. Starting in 2009, the RFS required that a portion of the RFS must be met by certain “advanced” renewable fuels. These advanced renewable fuels include ethanol that is not made from corn, such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based biodiesel. The use of these advanced renewable fuels increases each year as a percentage of the total renewable fuels required to be used in the United States.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has the authority to waive the RFS statutory volume requirement, in whole or in part, provided one of the following two conditions have been met: (1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply; or (2) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. Annually, the EPA is supposed to pass a rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligations. However, the EPA decided to delay finalizing the rule on the 2014 and 2015 RFS standards until after the end of 2014. On November 30, 2015, the EPA released the final renewable volume obligations for 2014, 2015 and 2016. There have been legal challenges to these final rules. On November 23, 2016, the EPA released the final renewable volume obligations for 2017. The statutory volumes and the EPA's volumes for 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 (in billion gallons) are as follows:

 | | Total Renewable Fuel Volume Requirement | Portion of Volume Requirement That Can Be Met By Corn-based Ethanol
2014 | Statutory | 18.15 | 14.40 
EPA Rule 11/30/2015 | 16.28 | 13.61 
2015 | Statutory | 20.50 | 15.00 
EPA Rule 11/30/2015 | 16.93 | 14.05 
2016 | Statutory | 22.25 | 15.00 
EPA Rule 11/30/2015 | 18.11 | 14.50 
2017 | Statutory | 24.00 | 15.00 
EPA Rule 11/23/2016 | 19.28 | 15.00 

If the volume requirements under the RFS were to be reduced in the future, it could have an adverse effect on the market price and demand for ethanol which could negatively impact our financial performance. 

In February 2010, the EPA issued additional regulations governing the RFS. These additional regulations have been called RFS2. The most controversial part of RFS2 involves what is commonly referred to as the lifecycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, the EPA adopted rules to determine which renewable fuels provided sufficient reductions in greenhouse gases, compared to conventional gasoline, to qualify under the RFS program. RFS2 establishes a tiered approach, where regular renewable fuels are required to accomplish a 20% greenhouse gas reduction compared to gasoline, advanced biofuels and biomass-based biodiesel must accomplish a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases, and cellulosic biofuels must accomplish a 60% reduction in greenhouse gases. Any fuels that fail to meet this standard cannot be used by fuel blenders to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program. The scientific method of calculating these greenhouse gas reductions has been a contentious issue. Many in the ethanol industry were concerned that corn based ethanol would not meet the 20% greenhouse gas reduction requirement based on certain parts of the environmental impact model that many in the ethanol industry believed was scientifically suspect. However, 
9

RFS2 as adopted by the EPA provides that corn-based ethanol from modern ethanol production processes does meet the definition of a renewable fuel under the RFS program. Our ethanol plant was grandfathered into the RFS due to the fact that it was constructed prior to the effective date of the lifecycle greenhouse gas requirement and is not required to prove compliance with the lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions. Many in the ethanol industry are concerned that certain provisions of RFS2 as adopted may disproportionately benefit ethanol produced from sugarcane. This could make sugarcane based ethanol, which is primarily produced in Brazil, more competitive in the United States ethanol market. If this were to occur, it could reduce demand for the ethanol that we produce. 

Most ethanol that is used in the United States is sold in a blend called E10. E10 is a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline. E10 is approved for use in all standard vehicles. Estimates indicate that the 2017 gasoline demand in the United States will be approximately 140 billion gallons. Assuming that all gasoline in the United States is blended at a rate of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, the maximum demand for ethanol is 14.0 billion gallons per year. This is commonly referred to as the “blending wall,” which represents a theoretical limit where more ethanol cannot be blended into the national gasoline pool. This is a theoretical limit because it is believed that it would not be possible to blend ethanol into every gallon of gasoline that is being used in the United States and it discounts the possibility of additional ethanol used in higher percentage blends such as E85 used in flex fuel vehicles. These higher percentage blends may lead to additional ethanol demand if they become more widely available and accepted by the market.
 In June 2012, the EPA gave final approval for the sale of E15, gasoline which is blended at a rate of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, for use in vehicles manufactured in the model year 2001 and later. Although this was a significant step towards introduction of E15 in the marketplace, there are still obstacles to meaningful market penetration by E15. Many states still have regulatory issues that hamper or prevent the sale of E15. In addition, sales of E15 may be limited because E15 is not approved for use in all vehicles, the EPA requires a label that may discourage consumers from using E15, and retailers may choose not to sell E15 due to concerns regarding liability. In addition, different gasoline blendstocks may be required at certain times of the year in order to use E15 due to federal regulations related to fuel evaporative emissions which may prevent E15 from being used during certain times of the year in various states. As a result, E15 has not had an immediate impact on ethanol demand in the United States.
Effect of Governmental Regulation 
The government's regulation of the environment changes constantly. We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations and we have been required to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate the plant. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could increase our operating costs and expenses. It also is possible that federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted that could have an adverse effect on the use of ethanol. For example, changes in the environmental regulations regarding the required oxygen content of automobile emissions could have an adverse effect on the ethanol industry. Plant operations are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). OSHA regulations may change such that the costs of operating the plant may increase. Any of these regulatory factors may result in higher costs or other adverse conditions effecting our operations, cash flows and financial performance. 
In late 2009, California passed a Low Carbon Fuels Standard ("LCFS"). The California LCFS requires that renewable fuels used in California must accomplish certain reductions in greenhouse gases which is measured using a lifecycle analysis, similar to the RFS. On December 29, 2011, a federal district court in California ruled that the California LCFS was unconstitutional which halted implementation of the California LCFS. However, the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") appealed this court ruling and on September 18, 2013, the federal appellate court reversed the federal district court finding the LCFS constitutional and remanding the case back to federal district court to determine whether the LCFS imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is excessive in light of the local benefits. On June 30, 2014, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of the federal appellate court ruling and CARB recently re-adopted the LCFS with some slight modifications. The LCFS could have a negative impact on demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices affecting our ability to operate profitably.

Competition
Ethanol
We are in direct competition with numerous ethanol producers, many of whom have greater resources than we do. Following the significant growth during 2005 and 2006, the ethanol industry has grown at a much slower pace. As of December 1, 2016, the Renewable Fuels Association estimates that there are 213 ethanol production facilities in the U.S. with capacity to produce approximately 15.8 billion gallons of ethanol and four additional plant under expansion or construction with capacity to produce an additional 237 million gallons. However, the Renewable Fuels Association estimates that approximately 3% of the ethanol production capacity in the United States is currently idled. 
Since ethanol is a commodity product, competition in the industry is predominantly based on price. We have also experienced increased competition from oil companies who have started purchasing ethanol production facilities. These oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year. Therefore, the oil companies may be able to operate their ethanol production facilities at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate. Larger ethanol producers may be able to realize economies of scale that we are unable to realize. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other ethanol producers. The ethanol industry is continuing to consolidate where a few larger ethanol producers are increasing their production capacities and are controlling a larger portion of the United States ethanol production. Further, some ethanol producers own multiple ethanol plants which may allow them to compete more effectively by providing them flexibility to run certain production facilities while they have other facilities shut down. This added flexibility may allow these ethanol producers to compete more effectively, especially during periods when operation margins are unfavorable in the ethanol industry. 
The largest ethanol producers include Archer Daniels Midland, Flint Hill Resources, Green Plains Renewable Energy, POET Biorefining and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which are capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. The following table identifies the majority of the largest ethanol producers in the United States along with their production capacities.
U.S. FUEL ETHANOL PRODUCTION CAPACITY 
BY TOP PRODUCERS
Producers of Approximately 750
million gallons per year (mmgy) or more

Company | Current Capacity(mmgy)
Archer Daniels Midland | 1,716.0 
POET Biorefining | 1,629.0 
Green Plains Renewable Energy | 1,461.0 
Valero Renewable Fuels | 1,400.0 
Flint Hill Resources | 820.0 

Updated: December 1, 2016
The ethanol industry in the United States experienced increased competition from ethanol produced outside of the United States during 2012 which was likely the result of the expiration of the tariff on imported ethanol which expired on December 31, 2011. Although ethanol imports decreased since 2012, increased competition from ethanol produced in foreign countries, particularly Brazil, could have a negative impact on demand for ethanol produced in the United States which could result in lower operating margins.
We also anticipate increased competition from renewable fuels that do not use corn as the feedstock. Many of the current ethanol production incentives are designed to encourage the production of renewable fuels using raw materials other than corn. One type of ethanol production feedstock is cellulose. Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls and is the most common organic compound on earth. Cellulose is found in wood chips, corn stalks, rice, straw, amongst other common plants. Cellulosic ethanol is ethanol produced from cellulose. Several companies and researchers have commenced pilot projects to study the feasibility of commercially producing cellulosic ethanol and are producing cellulosic ethanol on a small scale and at least three companies in the United States have begun producing on a commercial scale. Additional commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plants could be completed in the near future. If this technology can be profitably employed on a commercial scale, it could potentially lead to ethanol that is less expensive to produce than corn based ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol may also capture more

government subsidies and assistance than corn based ethanol. This could decrease demand for our product or result in competitive disadvantages for our ethanol production process.

Our ethanol plant also competes with producers of other gasoline additives having similar octane and oxygenate values as ethanol. Alternative fuels, gasoline oxygenates and alternative ethanol production methods are also continually under development. The major oil companies have significantly greater resources than we have to market other additives, to develop alternative products, and to influence legislation and public perception of ethanol. These companies also have sufficient resources to begin production of ethanol should they choose to do so.
 A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Electric car technology has grown in popularity, especially in urban areas. While currently there are a limited number of vehicle recharging stations, making electric cars not feasible for all consumers, there has been increased focus on developing these recharging stations which may make electric car technology more widely available in the future. This additional competition from alternate sources could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.
Distillers Grains 
Our ethanol plant competes with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. The primary consumers of distillers grains are dairy and beef cattle. In recent years, an increasing amount of distillers grains have been used in the swine and poultry markets. Numerous feeding trials show advantages in milk production, growth, rumen health, and palatability over other dairy cattle feeds. With the advancement of research into the feeding rations of swine and poultry, we expect these markets to expand and create additional demand for distillers grains; however, no assurance can be given that these markets will in fact expand, or if they do, that we will benefit from it. The market for distillers grains is generally confined to locations where freight costs allow it to be competitively priced against other feed ingredients. Distillers grains compete with three other feed formulations: corn gluten feed, dry brewers grain and mill feeds. The primary value of these products as animal feed is their protein content. Dry brewers grain and distillers grains have about the same protein content, and corn gluten feed and mill feeds have slightly lower protein contents. 
Corn Oil Competition
We compete with many ethanol producers for the sale of corn oil. Many ethanol producers have installed the equipment necessary to separate corn oil from the distillers grains they produce which has increased competition for corn oil sales and has resulted in lower market corn oil prices.
Cost of Compliance with Environmental Laws
We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations and we were required to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate the plant. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations. Additionally, any changes that are made to the ethanol plant or its operations must be reviewed to determine if amended permits need to be obtained in order to implement these changes. 
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, we incurred costs and expenses of approximately $322,295 complying with environmental laws. 
Butamax Advanced Biofuels Letter of Intent
In November 2011, we signed a non-binding letter of intent with Butamax Advanced Biofuels, L.L.C. ("Butamax") for the purpose of exploring the possible implementation of biobutanol technology and commercial-scale production of biobutanol at our facility. We completed Phase 1 of the project in April 2014 with the installation of a corn oil separation system at our plant. Please refer to “ITEM 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.” However, Phase 2 of the project, the implementation of biobutanol technology, is dependent upon completion and execution of separate definitive agreements related to biobutanol production and negotiations related to Phase 2 of the project are currently on hold.  We may never enter into those definitive agreements with Butamax and, therefore, may never convert our ethanol facility to a biobutanol facility.

Employees 
As of October 31, 2016, we had 41 full-time employees. We do not expect the number of employees to materially change in the next twelve months.
Financial Information about Geographic Areas
All of our operations are domiciled in the United States. All of the products sold to our customers for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 were produced in the United States and all of our long-lived assets are domiciled in the United States. We have engaged third-party professional marketers that decide where the majority of our products are marketed and we have limited control over the marketing decisions made by our third-party professional marketers. These third-party marketers may decide to sell our products in countries other than the United States. However, we anticipate that our products will primarily be marketed and sold in the United States.
