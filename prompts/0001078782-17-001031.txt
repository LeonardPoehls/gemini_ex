ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Homie Recipes, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit company on June 22, 2012 and established June 30 as its fiscal year end.
 
Homie is a startup company that intends to stream videos and written recipes through a website. Our goal is to stream free recipes for ‘special’ homemade cuisines and food items. We intend to have recipes that are personal and have special meaning, on our website. What makes a recipe ‘special’ is the personal history or tradition behind it, for example, cookies made by someone’s mother on Christmas Eve, or a special pasta sauce prepared by their Grandmother made every Sunday when they were growing up, etc.
 
We plan on having an introductory segment for our videos, where a person will tell their story behind the recipe, explaining why they love it so much. After the introduction, we will have the ‘mothers’, ‘grandmothers’ or whomever the cook is, to prepare the recipe and food presentation. The last part of our videos will show the cook eating and enjoying the food.
 
We intend to allow users to upload their own videos, following our program format (introduction, recipe preparation, food presentation and tasting). All videos will be edited for time and content and will be subject to approval before it goes public on our website. We intend to generate revenue through the sale of advertisement to be placed throughout our website and in the videos.
 
We have been unable to raise additional funds to implement our operations, and we do not believe that we currently have sufficient resources to do so without additional funding. As a result of the current difficult economic environment and our lack of funding to implement our business plan, our Board of Directors has continued to analyze strategic alternatives available to our Company to continue as a going concern. Such alternatives include raising additional debt or equity financing or consummating a merger or acquisition with a partner that may involve a change in our business plan.

Our Board believes that it must consider all viable strategic alternatives that are in the best interests of our shareholders. Such strategic alternatives include a merger, acquisition, share exchange, asset purchase, or similar transaction in which our present management will no longer be in control of our Company and our business operations will be replaced by that of our transaction partner. We believe we would be an attractive candidate for such a business combination due to the perceived benefits of being a publicly registered company, thereby providing a transaction partner access to the public marketplace to raise capital.
 
We have had preliminary discussions with potential business combination partners, but have not signed a definitive agreement to engage in a strategic transaction as of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any such business combination and the selection of a partner for such a business combination involves certain risks, including analyzing and selecting a business partner that is compatible to engage in a transaction with us or has business operations that are or will prove to be profitable. In the event we select a partner for a strategic transaction and sign a definitive agreement to consummate such a transaction, we will report this event on a Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If we are unable to locate a suitable business combination partner and are otherwise unable to raise additional funding, we will likely be forced to cease business operations.
 
Plan of Operation
 
The Company has not yet generated any revenue from its operations. As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we had no cash on hand. We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $20,080 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. These operating expenses were comprised mainly of professional fees.
 
We are exclusively dependent upon the success of future equity financings. Therefore, the failure thereof would result in need to seek capital from other resources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are a early-stage company with no operations to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing, it would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors would lose all of their investment.
 
After we have raised enough funds to start this plan of operations, we plan to accomplish the following phases:
 
Estimated time for completion of each phase of our Plan of Operations
 

Phase 1 - Website development | Month 1 to 6 
--------------------------------------+--------------
Phase 2 - Finding advertising clients | Month 6 to 12
Phase 3 - Marketing | Month 9 to 12
Total | 12 months 

 
First phase: Website development
 
After we acquire the initial necessary funds, we plan on fully developing our website (www.homierecipes.com), which is currently under construction. Our plan is to create a user-friendly website that will include written and video instructions for the creation of the recipe videos which the Company will be able to edit and approve before they go public on our website. We intend to run several tests to ensure the functionality of the website.
 
We plan on hiring third party web developers to finalize our website. The president will be responsible for hiring such third party personnel. The president and the secretary will be responsible for editing and selecting the recipes and videos uploaded by our cooks.
 
We intend to allocate between $3,000 and $35,000 for our tests and website costs, depending on availability of funds.

Second Phase: Finding advertising clients
 
After we have fully developed our website, we will search for advertising clients. We intend to try and secure contracts with companies that will pay us to place advertisement in our website and videos. We will search for cooking and food related companies, such as: groceries stores, appliances stores and fabricators, specific food companies, etc.
 
We expect to allocate between $1,000 and $15,000 to cover costs related to finding advertising clients, depending on the availability of funds. These costs will be used for travel costs, meals and other expenses in connection with meeting with prospective clients. We intend to focus on large international companies, but we may focus only on local business, depending on the funds available.
 
Third Phase: Marketing
 
In order to have a profitable business, we will need to have as many clients who will pay for advertisements as possible. To attract clients, we’ll need to have as many users as we can, including users that will upload new recipes and users that will visit our website to see those recipes.
 
For our marketing campaign, we plan to have a presence in social medias such as: Twitter and Facebook. If finances allow, we plan on placing advertisements in specialized magazines, restaurants and websites and ultimately, TV commercials. Our goal is to make our website mainstream. Our president will be responsible for our marketing campaign.
 
We plan on investing between $2,000 and $30,000 for our marketing campaign, depending on the availability of funds.
 
Office supplies, Stationery, Telephones, Internet
 
We intend to allocate between $150 and $1,150 to cover these costs, at the president’s discretion, depending on the availability of funds.
 
After successfully completing the above-described phases, we believe we will start generating revenue.
 
Our business office is located at 112 North Curry Street, Carson City, Nevada, 89703; our telephone number is (775) 321-8225 and our fax number is (775) 546-9905. Our United States and registered statutory office is located at 112 North Curry Street, Carson City, Nevada, 89703, telephone number (775) 882-1013.
 
The Company intends to focus its business in the United States of America.
 
Market Opportunity
 
The Company believes that our website may attract a wide range of users, including food lovers, cooks and people in the food industry who enjoy good food.
 
Food is a basic necessity for people, but it can also provide and create special moments and occasions. We believe that there are a greater number of people who prefer homemade food. We also believe that the internet is accessible to the mass population worldwide. Our website will be devoted to users that will be looking to share and learn new food recipes from different cultures. For this reason, we believe that it will be possible to find clients from the food industry to advertise on our website.
 
Description of our Services
 
We plan on having an introductory segment for our videos, where a person will tell the story behind their recipe and explain why their dish is special and unique. After the introduction, we will have the ‘mothers’, ‘grandmothers’ or whomever the cook is, to prepare the recipe and food presentation. The last part of our videos will show the participant eating and enjoying the food.
 
We intend to allow users to upload their own videos, following our program format (introduction, recipe preparation, food presentation and tasting). All videos will be edited for time and content and will be subject to approval before it goes public on our website. We intend to generate revenue through the sale of advertisement to be placed throughout our website and in our videos.
 
We need funds to fully develop our website, for our marketing campaign (our goal is to make our website mainstream) and to find advertising clients (food related companies).
 
We expect to start generating revenues after we are able to fully develop our website, and after we search for advertising clients, according to our Plan of Operation.

Competitive Advantages
 
The Company is unaware of any existing website exclusively dedicated to the free uploading and viewing of homemade food recipes.
 
Our Company has yet to enter the market and has no presence in the food preparation industry thus far. In order to enter into the market, we have to be able to successfully implement its plan of operation.
 
We believe that our business model is innovative, and once we are able to start our business there will be no, or few, direct competitors, as we have no knowledge of any other service similar to the one we intend to offer.
 
We will be competing against bigger and established website companies and TV shows that stream cooking recipes. Our strategy is to offer an innovative, personal and appealing way to stream homemade recipes where everyone will be able to add their own recipes to our website.
 
Marketing
 
For our marketing campaign, we intend to fully develop our under construction website (www.homierecipes.com). The website shall be developed with more or less features, depending on the availability of funds. We intend to hire a third party website developer to finish construction of our website.
 
In order to have a profitable business, we will need to have as many clients who will pay for advertisements as possible. To attract clients, we’ll need to have as many users as we can, including users that will upload new recipes and users that will visit our website to see those recipes.
 
We also plan to have a presence in social media such as: Twitter and Facebook. If finances allow, we plan on placing advertisements in specialized magazines, restaurants and food related websites and ultimately, TV commercials. Our goal is to make our website mainstream. Our president will be responsible for our marketing campaign.
 
We plan on investing between $2,000 and $30,000 for our marketing campaign.
 
We have not yet contacted or secured any kind of agreement and/or contract with any third parties.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We intend, in due course, subject to legal advice, to apply for trademark protection and/or copyright protection of our future intellectual property and products in the United States and other jurisdictions.
 
We intend to aggressively assert our rights trademark and copyright laws to protect our future intellectual property, including product design, concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of trademark registrations, the maintenance of copyrights, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights.
 
While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks and copyrights will protect our proprietary information, we intend to assert our future intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights can result in a substantial cost to, and diversion of effort by, our Company, management believes that the protection of our future intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
We are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations of the homemade recipes industry. However, we still need to verify certifications and possible government approvals needed to execute our business. We are subject to the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions in which we plan to sell our services, which are generally applicable to business operations, such as business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.

Employees and Employment Agreements
 
The Company has no permanent staff other than its sole executive officer and sole director, Mr. Jose Mari C. Chin, who is the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. Our sole executive officer and sole director is employed elsewhere but has the flexibility to work on the Company’s matters up to eight (8) hours per week.
 
There are no employment agreements in existence. The Company presently does not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, the Company may adopt such plans in the future. Management does not plan to hire additional employees at this time. Our sole officer and director will be responsible for the initial servicing. Once the Company begins building its Internet website, it will hire an independent consultant to build the site. The Company also intends to hire sales representatives initially on a commission only basis to keep administrative overhead to a minimum.
