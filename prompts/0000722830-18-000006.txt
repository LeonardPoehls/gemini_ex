Item 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Immunomedics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing monoclonal antibody-based products for the targeted treatment of cancer. Our advanced proprietary technologies allow us to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled or “naked” form, or conjugated with chemotherapeutics, cytokines or toxins. Our most advanced product candidate is sacituzumab govitecan ("IMMU-132"), an antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC”) that has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for the treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (“mTNBC”) who previously received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. 
Our current focus is to commercialize sacituzumab govitecan as a third-line therapy for patients with mTNBC in the United States. On May 21, 2018 we submitted a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to the FDA for sacituzumab govitecan for the treatment of patients with mTNBC who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. On July 18, 2018 we received notification from the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") that the BLA was accepted for filing and granted Priority Review with a PDUFA target action date of January 18, 2019. If approved, sacituzumab govitecan would be the first and only ADC approved for the treatment of mTNBC.
 As of June 30, 2018, we had $638.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. On January 7, 2018, we announced that we sold tiered, sales-based royalty rights on global net sales of sacituzumab govitecan to RPI Finance Trust (“RPI”) for $175.0 million. RPI also purchased $75.0 million of our common stock at $17.15 per share, which represented a more than 15% premium over the stock’s 15-day trailing average closing price at that time. On June 15, 2018, we announced the closing of a public offering of 11,500,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $24.00 per share. On June 22, 2018, pursuant to the underwriter's full exercise of the over-allotment option, we closed the sale of an additional 1,725,000 shares of our common stock. The total net proceeds from the offering, including the exercise of the over-allotment option, were approximately $300 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. We believe our projected financial resources are adequate to (i) support our next phase of growth as we focus on commercializing and developing sacituzumab govitecan in mTNBC, advanced urothelial cancer ("UC"), advanced ER+ BC and other indications of high medical need, (ii) further build our clinical, medical affairs, commercial and manufacturing infrastructure, (iii) begin to commercialize sacituzumab govitecan globally, and (iv) fund operations into 2021 or beyond assuming we meet our regulatory and commercial objectives. However, in case of regulatory delays, alterations to our commercial forecast, or other unforeseen events, we may require additional funding in 2021. Potential sources of funding in such a case could include (i) the entrance into potential development and commercial partnerships to advance and maximize our full pipeline for mTNBC and beyond in the United States and globally, and (ii) potential private and capital markets financing. 

For fiscal year 2019, our strategic priorities for sacituzumab govitecan includes:

1. | Initiate clinical studies in second-line mTNBC as a monotherapy and in combination with PARP and checkpoint inhibitors in first line;


2. | Complete patient enrollment into the pivotal Phase 2 TROPHY-U01 study in metastatic UC;


3. | Launch a pivotal study in estrogen receptor-positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer ("mBC"); and


4. | Finalize commercial strategy in the European Union and complete licensing arrangement for territories outside the United States and Europe.

In addition, we plan to formalize a manufacturing and development plan for labetuzumab govitecan (“IMMU-130”), our second ADC that targets CEACMA5, and continue IND enabling work for IMMU-140, an anti-HLA-DR ADC, to be evaluated for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.

Our Clinical and Preclinical Programs
We believe that our antibodies have therapeutic potential, in some cases as a naked antibody or when conjugated with chemotherapeutics, cytokines or other toxins to create unique and potentially more effective treatment options. The attachment of effective anti-tumor compounds to antibodies is intended to allow the delivery of these therapeutic agents to tumor sites with better specificity than conventional chemotherapy. This treatment method is designed to reduce the total exposure of the patient to the therapeutic agents, which ideally minimizes debilitating side effects.
Our portfolio of investigational products includes ADCs that are designed to deliver a specific payload of a chemotherapeutic directly to the tumor while reducing overall toxicities that are usually found with conventional administration of these chemotherapeutic agents. Our most advanced ADCs are sacituzumab govitecan (“IMMU-132”) and labetuzumab govitecan (“IMMU-130”), which are in advanced trials for a number of solid tumors and metastatic colorectal cancer ("CRC"), respectively. Sacituzumab govitecan is our lead product candidate and has received BTD from the FDA for the treatment of patients with metastatic mTNBC who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease.
The BLA submitted in 2018 for sacituzumab govitecan in patients with mTNBC has been accepted by the FDA and granted Priority Review. Refer to "Overview" above for additional information.
 To accelerate the clinical and preclinical development of sacituzumab govitecan, we have entered into a clinical collaboration with AstraZeneca and signed a letter of intent to enter into a clinical collaboration with Clovis to investigate the ADC in earlier lines of therapy for mTNBC and advanced UC in combination with checkpoint and PARP inhibitors, respectively. For other cancer indications, we are working with the University of Wisconsin and Fred Hutchison Cancer Center on prostate cancer, Yale University Cancer Center on endometrial and cervical cancers, and with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center on head and neck cancer.  Refer to "Corporate Collaboration" and "Other Collaborations" below for additional information.
We also have a number of other product candidates that target solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, in various stages of clinical and preclinical development. They include other ADCs such as labetuzumab govitecan, which binds the CEACAM5 antigen expressed on CRC and other solid cancers, and IMMU-140 that targets HLA-DR for the potential treatment of hematologic malignancies. We believe that our portfolio of intellectual property provides commercially reasonable protection for our product candidates and technologies.
Below is our broad pipeline ADC therapies:
Antibody-Drug Conjugates
Our first ADC program, sacituzumab govitecan, is an anti-TROP-2-SN-38 ADC currently being clinically evaluated in patients with a variety of solid tumors, including Phase 3 ASCENT trial for patients with mTNBC who have received at least two prior therapies and the pivotal Phase 2 TROPHY-U01 study for patients with advanced UC. Labetuzumab govitecan, the second agent from our ADC program, is an anti-CEACAM5-SN-38 ADC which has been evaluated in a Phase 1/2 trial for the treatment of metastatic CRC. Our third ADC, IMMU-140, targets the HLA-DR antigen and is in preclinical development.

Sacituzumab Govitecan/IMMU-132
Sacituzumab govitecan has been studied in over 500 cancer patients in more than 15 types of solid cancers, with the dose of 10 mg/kg given on days 1 and 8 of repeated 21-day cycles being the established dose regimen. Sacituzumab govitecan received BTD from the FDA for the treatment of patients with mTNBC who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. The FDA has also granted sacituzumab govitecan Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with mTNBC and for patients with small-cell lung cancer ("SCLC"), or non-small-cell lung cancer ("NSCLC"). Sacituzumab govitecan has also been designated an orphan drug by the FDA for the treatment of patients with SCLC or pancreatic cancer in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer in the European Union.
Clinical development of sacituzumab govitecan has focused on a number of select types of solid cancers including mTNBC, hormone receptor-positive (HR+) mBC, advanced UC, SCLC, NSCLC, and certain other cancers.
The BLA submitted in 2018 for sacituzumab govitecan in patients with mTNBC has been accepted by the FDA and granted Priority Review. Refer to "Overview" above for additional information.
In April 2018, FDA agreed to our proposed amendments to the confirmatory ASCENT trial protocol that is under a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”). The amendments incorporated recommendations from EU National Health authorities and input and advice from key breast cancer experts. The key protocol changes, amongst others, are:

• | A capping of the proportion of patients with stable brain metastasis to no more than 15% of the total enrollment;


• | An increase of the sample size from 328 to 488 patients, which will allow for progression-free survival (“PFS”) to be analyzed in patients without brain metastasis, while keeping intact the statistical power to analyze PFS in the overall population; and


• | Increased power for key secondary endpoints such as overall survival.

Based on strong early enrollment trends, we believe these changes will not meaningfully impact overall study timelines. We believe that FDA’s agreement to this SPA amendment may further increase the probability of success of the study, while leaving key study objectives and endpoints intact.
Another breast cancer indication that is a key strategic focus for the Company is ER+ mBC. Phase 2 results of sacituzumab govitecan in patients with treatment-refractory HR+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ("HER2-") mBC, a patient population with the distinct need for better treatment options, were presented at the 2018 ASCO Annual Meeting. In the Phase 1/2 study, 54 patients with ER+/HER2-mBC who received sacituzumab govitecan at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of three-week cycles showed a confirmed overall response rate ("ORR") of 31 percent (17/54), based on local investigator assessment in accordance with RECIST 1.1. The estimated median duration of response was 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.4, 18.3), the clinical benefit rate ("CBR"); partial response and stable disease lasting for six months and longer) was 48 percent (26/54). At the time of data cutoff on April 30, 2018, seven responders were still receiving sacituzumab govitecan.
In the subgroup of 37 patients who also had received prior CDK 4/6 inhibitors, ORR was 24 percent (9/37). In the difficult-to-treat subgroup of patients with liver metastases, CBR was 48 percent (21/44). The estimated median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI: 4.6, 8.9).
All patients had received at least two prior treatments for metastatic disease, with a median of three hormonal agents and two chemotherapy regimens. Prior treatments in any setting included taxanes (93 percent), anthracyclines (69 percent) and CDK 4/6 inhibitors (69 percent). Patients generally tolerated the treatment with sacituzumab govitecan well, with no treatment-related deaths and only two patients (3.7 percent) discontinued due to adverse events. Median number of doses was 11 (range: 1-74), and the median duration of treatment was 4.0 months (range: 0.2-26.0 months). The only grade 3 or 4 toxicity with greater than 10 percent frequency was neutropenia (42 percent), which is consistent with the safety profile observed in metastatic mTNBC. 
In advanced UC, sacituzumab govitecan was found to be effective in patients who have relapsed or are refractory to chemotherapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors (“IOs”), as reported by our clinical investigator at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress held during September 2017.
The Company’s strategy to broaden the development of sacituzumab govitecan beyond mTNBC and advanced UC includes meeting the high unmet medical need in patients such as advanced CRPC, endometrial cancer and cervical cancer. To that end, the Company, through an agreement with The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium, is collaborating with the 
4

University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center to investigate sacituzumab govitecan in an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 trial to assess whether targeting Trop-2 with sacituzumab govitecan is promising in prostate cancer patients. Approximately 55-60 male patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer ("CRPC") progressing on enzalutamide or abiraterone, objectively or based on prostate-specific antigen level, in either hormone naïve or CRPC settings will be enrolled into the multicenter study, which will be funded by the Company. A recently agreed research collaboration with Yale University will enable the clinical investigation of sacituzumab govitecan in patients with advanced endometrial and cervical cancer.
We have an extensive intellectual property portfolio protecting sacituzumab govitecan. Specifically, 44 patents were issued in the United States and 26 foreign patents were issued covering composition of matter, synthesis and uses. Certain patents relating to the protein sequence of the hRS7 antibody used in sacituzumab govitecan expired in 2017 in the United States and will expire in 2023 overseas. Patents to compositions and use of the CL2A linker incorporated in sacituzumab govitecan expire between 2023 and 2029 in the United States and overseas. Other patents relating to methods of cancer therapy with the SN-38 conjugated form of hRS7 used in sacituzumab govitecan extend to 2033. Additionally, we are entitled to extend the term of our key patent for up to 5 more years in the United States and certain foreign countries. Outside the United States, patents were issued in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and other key global markets.
Labetuzumab Govitecan/IMMU-130
Our second investigational solid-tumor ADC involves our anti-CEACAM5 antibody labetuzumab, conjugated to SN-38. The agent has been studied in patients with metastatic CRC who had received at least one prior irinotecan-containing regimen and had an elevated blood titer of carcinoembryonic antigen.
Labetuzumab govitecan was well-tolerated, with a manageable toxicity profile. Major toxicities (Grade >3) among all cohorts were neutropenia (16%), leukopenia (11%), anemia (9%), and diarrhea (7%). Anti-drug or anti-antibody antibodies were not detected.
Although certain patents relating to labetuzumab used in labetuzumab govitecan expired in 2016, other patents relating to use of labetuzumab for cancer therapy, including the SN-38 conjugated form of labetuzumab used in labetuzumab govitecan, extend to 2033.
IMMU-140
IMMU-140 is our third ADC that is a SN-38 conjugated form of IMMU-114. The latter is a novel humanized antibody directed against an immune response target, HLA-DR. As such, IMMU-140 is a dual-therapeutic, combining the signaling functions of the parental antibody, IMMU-114, with the cytotoxicity of SN-38. In preclinical studies, IMMU-140 demonstrated higher potency than naked IMMU-114 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelocytic leukemia, a disease that despite having high expression levels of HLA-DR, has proven to be resistant to the antitumor effects of IMMU-114 in vitro, thus warrants further clinical development.
Other Product Candidates
We have additional potential products for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases including epratuzumab, our anti-CD22 antibody; veltuzumab, our anti-CD20 antibody; milatuzumab, our anti-CD74 antibody; and IMMU-114, a humanized anti-HLA-DR antibody. We are evaluating various options, including licensing arrangements and collaborations with outside study groups, for further clinical development of these assets in oncology and autoimmune disease indications, including pemphigus.
Our Platform Technologies
In our drive to improve targeted therapies of diseases, we have built significant expertise in antibody engineering, particularly proprietary CDR-grafting methods, antibody production and formulation, immunochemistry, molecular biology, antibody conjugation, peptide chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and protein engineering.
Beginning with our unique grafting technique to engineer humanized antibodies, our antibody humanization platform has produced a diverse portfolio of therapeutic agents that are in multiple stages of clinical trials for the therapy of cancer, as detailed above. These humanized antibodies are well tolerated and also have a low incidence of immunogenicity.
5

With the successful humanized antibody platform as a foundation, we have built a robust ADC program using our own proprietary ADC linker technology. Finally, our protein engineering platform technology called DOCK-AND-LOCK® combines conjugation chemistry and genetic engineering to produce bioactive molecules of increasing complexity.
ADC Linker Technology
We developed a novel ADC platform using our proprietary linker, CL2A, which was designed with targeted delivery of SN-38 in mind. SN-38 is about 3 orders of magnitude (100 to 1,000 times) more potent than irinotecan, its parent drug, but it cannot be administered systemically to patients because of its poor water solubility and toxicity. Our linker, CL2A, allows us to produce SN-38 conjugates that are soluble in water with excellent yields while preserving antibody binding and drug activity.
CL2A contains an antibody coupling group on one end and a chemical group on the other for binding with a drug. We have also added a short polyethylene glycol to improve the solubility of CL2A.
Furthermore, because SN-38 can be converted from its active lactone form to the inactive carboxylate form, CL2A was designed to attach close to the lactone ring to prevent it from opening up, thereby maintaining the activity of SN-38. Another key feature of our ADC platform is that the linkage between CL2A and SN-38 is sensitive to both acidic and alkaline conditions and will allow the detachment of SN-38 at a rate of about 50% per day in vivo.
The final structure of our ADC is depicted below, with the pH-sensitive cleavable linkage highlighted. What differentiates our ADC platform from other companies is the high drug-to-antibody ratio of about seven to eight molecules of drug per antibody. That is to say, when our ADCs bind to their targets on cancer cells, they are delivering up to eight molecules of SN-38 per antibody molecule into the blood or at the vicinity of the tumor, which may explain why our ADCs can deliver more than 120-times the amount of SN-38 to the tumor when studied in an animal model, as compared to irinotecan, the parent compound. We can deliver this drug concentration because our drug is not supertoxic, thus permitting us to give higher antibody doses, in repeated therapy cycles, that we believe provide a better therapeutic index.

DOCK-AND-LOCK® Platform Technology
We developed a platform technology, called the DOCK-AND-LOCK® ("DNL®") method, which has the potential for making a considerable number of bioactive molecules of increasing complexity. DNL® utilizes the natural interaction between two human proteins, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (“PKA”) and A-kinase anchoring proteins (“AKAPs”). The region that is involved in such interaction for PKA is called the dimerization and docking domain, (“DDD”), which always is produced in pairs. Its binding partner in AKAPs is the anchoring domain (“AD”). When mixed together, DDD and AD will bind with each other spontaneously to form a binary complex, a process termed docking. Once “docked,” certain amino acid residues incorporated into DDD and AD will react with each other to “lock” them into a stably-tethered structure. The outcome of the DNL® method is the exclusive generation of a stable complex, in a quantitative manner that retains the full biological activities of its individual components.
DNL® combines conjugation chemistry and genetic engineering to enable the creation of novel human therapeutics, and the potential construction of improved recombinant products over those currently on the market. Diverse drugs, chemical polymers, proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids are among suitable components that can be linked to either DDD or AD. Since the invention of DNL®, we have created multivalent, mono- or multi-specific antibodies, DNL-PEGylated cytokines; and cytokine-antibody conjugates.
We have employed DNL® to create bispecific antibodies targeting cancers as a T-cell redirecting immunotherapy. This is one of several new methods of cancer immunotherapy being studied both clinically and preclinically by many other commercial and academic groups. In contrast to hematological tumors, little progress has been made in this approach to treat the more challenging solid cancers, including pancreatic and gastric cancers, two malignancies with very high rates of mortality.
In this regard, we are developing a novel investigational T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody, (E1)-3s, created using DNL® for the potential treatment of pancreatic and gastric cancers. These and various other solid cancers express high-levels of Trop-2, a target recognized by the bispecific (E1)-3s, which also binds to the CD3 antigen on T cells. (E1)-3s effectively induced a potent and specific T-cell-mediated killing of human pancreatic and gastric cancer cell lines.
7

Furthermore, in animal models of human pancreatic or gastric cancer, treatment with (E1)-3s significantly inhibited tumor growth, which resulted in improved survival compared with the control groups. Adding IFNα enhanced the tumor-growth-inhibition activity of (E1)-3s.
As with all candidate therapeutic molecules developed by us, the safety and potential efficacy cannot be predicted until sufficient trials in humans have been conducted.
Diagnostic Imaging Products
We transitioned away from the development and commercialization of new diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates. The Company discontinued the sale of LeukoScan® during the third quarter of 2018 to focus on its ADC business.
Research and Development Expense
We have historically invested heavily in our research and development programs, spending approximately $99.3 million, $51.8 million and $53.5 million for these programs during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in research and development costs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 relate primarily to increases in clinical trial costs as well as increases in lab supplies and chemical reagents and personnel costs in connection with preparations for the approval and launch of sacituzumab govitecan in the United States for patients with mTNBC. The decrease in research and development costs during the 2017 fiscal year resulted primarily from the closure of the Phase 3 pancreatic cancer “PANCRIT Trial” in the 2016 fiscal year, partially offset by higher spending in product development expense related to the manufacturing of sacituzumab govitecan.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
Our Patents
We have accumulated a sizeable portfolio of patents and patent applications in the course of our research, which we believe constitutes a valuable business asset. Our key patents relate primarily to our therapeutic product candidates as well as our technologies and other discoveries for which no product candidate has yet been identified. As of August 23, 2018, our portfolio included approximately 303 active United States patents. In addition, as of such date, the portfolio included more than 400 foreign patents, with a number of United States and foreign patent applications pending.
The chart below highlights our material patents and product groups as of August 23, 2018, the major jurisdictions, and relevant expiration periods.

Corporate Collaboration
AstraZeneca/MedImmune
In June 2018, the Company entered into a clinical collaboration with AstraZeneca and its global biologics research and development arm, MedImmune, to evaluate in Phase 1/2 studies the safety and efficacy of combining AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi® (durvalumab), a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1, with sacituzumab govitecan as a frontline treatment of patients with TNBC and urothelial cancer (“UC”).
Part one of the two-part Phase 1/2 studies will be co-funded by the two companies. Immunomedics will supply the study drug and AstraZeneca will utilize its existing clinical trial infrastructure to accelerate the enrollment of the sacituzumab govitecan and durvalumab combination. The trial design allows for rapid transition into randomized Phase 2 studies should the first part of these studies show promising data and the companies agree to proceed based on efficacy and safety results obtained. 
Clovis Oncology
In June 2018 the Company signed a letter of intent to enter into a clinical collaboration with Clovis Oncology, Inc. to investigate the combination of Clovis’ Rubraca® (rucaparib), a poly (ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi), and sacituzumab govitecan as a second-line treatment of patients with mTNBC and mUC. The planned phase 1/2 study will include an initial safety cohort followed by expansion cohorts in each of mTNBC and mUC.
The Bayer Group (formerly Algeta ASA) 
In fiscal 2013 the Company entered into a collaboration agreement, referred to herein as the Collaboration Agreement, with Algeta ASA (subsequently acquired by The Bayer Group “Bayer”), for the development of epratuzumab to be conjugated with Algeta’s proprietary thorium-227 alpha-pharmaceutical payload. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, the Company manufactured and supplied clinical-grade epratuzumab to Bayer, which has rights to evaluate the potential of a Targeted Thorium Conjugate (TTC), linking thorium-227 to epratuzumab, for the treatment of patients with cancer. Bayer has the right to terminate the Collaboration Agreement with three months prior written notice, subject to certain provisions. Bayer will fund all non-clinical and clinical development costs up to the end of Phase 1 clinical testing. Upon successful completion of Phase 1 testing, the parties shall negotiate terms for a license agreement at Bayer’s request. The Company and Bayer have agreed to certain parameters in the Collaboration Agreement. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, as amended, Immunomedics received an upfront cash payment and other payments aggregating $6.0 million, which have been recognized in prior periods upon the Company fulfilling its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. 
In January 2017, the Company recorded revenue of $0.3 million representing an anniversary payment under the agreement. This agreement has been extended to December 30, 2018 and, as amended, provides for the Company to receive a similar anniversary payment of $0.3 million, which was received in April 2018.
Other Collaborations
We have established multiple clinical and preclinical collaborations with academic cancer institutions with the objectives of identifying new cancer indications for sacituzumab govitecan and gaining a better understanding of the biology of the Trop-2 antigen. 
In prostate cancer, we are working with the Carbone Cancer Center at the University of Wisconsin, through an agreement with The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium, to evaluate sacituzumab govitecan in an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 trial in patients with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In addition to the Phase 2 trial, Dr. Lang, the lead investigator at the University of Wisconsin, will also be leading a broad translational program integrated into the clinical study to further validate the expression and importance of Trop-2 as a therapeutic target in various stages of prostate cancer. A separate research collaboration was also established between the Company and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to investigate sacituzumab govitecan and labetuzumab govitecan (IMMU-130) as single agent and in combination in prostate cancer xenograft models.
In gynecologic cancers, we have recently entered into an agreement with the Yale Cancer Center at the Yale University School of Medicine to investigate sacituzumab govitecan in two Phase 2 studies in patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial and cervical cancers. The principal investigator of the studies, Dr. Santin, will also be conducting preclinical 
10

evaluation of sacituzumab govitecan as a single agent and in combination with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors in animal in vivo models of gynecologic cancers. 
We have also entered into a research collaboration with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to assess sacituzumab govitecan as a single agent and in combination with epidermal growth factor receptor and phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors, and cisplatin in head and neck cancer in vitro and in vivo models.
In previous years, we conducted research on a number of our programs in collaboration with CMMI and its clinical unit, the Garden State Cancer Center. CMMI performed contracted pilot and preclinical trials in scientific areas of importance to us and also conducted basic research and preclinical evaluations in a number of areas of potential interest to us. Dr. David M. Goldenberg, former Chief Scientific Officer, Chief Patent Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, was the President and a Member of the Board of Trustees of CMMI. CMMI has ceased operations and is in the process of dissolution.
Government Regulation
Regulatory Compliance
Our research and development activities, including testing in laboratory animals and in humans, our manufacture of antibodies and oversight of suppliers and contract manufacturers involved in the production of our product candidates, as well as the design, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, handling, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion and marketing of the product candidates that we are developing, are all subject to stringent regulation, primarily by the FDA in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA) and its implementing regulations, and the Public Health Service Act (PHS act) and its implementing regulations, and by comparable authorities under similar laws and regulations in other countries. If for any reason we do not comply with applicable requirements, such noncompliance can result in various adverse consequences, including one or more delays in approval of, or even the refusal to approve, product licenses or other applications, the suspension or termination of clinical investigations, the revocation of approvals previously granted, as well as fines, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of products, injunctions against shipping products and total or partial suspension of production and/or refusal to allow us to enter into governmental supply contracts.
Product Approval
In the United States, our product candidates are regulated as biologic pharmaceuticals, or biologics. The FDA's regulatory authority for the approval of biologics resides in the PHS Act. However, biologics are also subject to regulation under the FDCA because most biological products also meet the FDCA's definition of "drugs." Most pharmaceuticals or "conventional drugs" consist of pure chemical substances and their structures are known. Most biologics, however, are complex mixtures that are not easily identified or characterized. Biological products differ from conventional drugs in that they tend to be heat-sensitive and susceptible to microbial contamination, thus requiring sterile manufacturing processes. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) the ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic, and the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA for a new biologic, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations; and

11


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA for a new biologic, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.

Preclinical tests assess the potential safety and efficacy of a product candidate in animal models. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
The clinical investigation of a pharmaceutical, including a biologic, is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.

• | Phase 1 studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.


• | Phase 2 includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational product for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product.


• | Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.

The FDA may place clinical trials on hold at any point in this process if, among other reasons, it concludes that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Trials may also be terminated by IRBs, which must review and approve all research involving human subjects. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing authorization.
The results of the preclinical and clinical testing, along with information regarding the manufacturing of the product and proposed product labeling, are evaluated and, if determined appropriate, submitted to the FDA through a BLA. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Once the BLA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s standard goal is to review applications within ten months of the filing date or, if the application relates to a drug that treats a serious condition and would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness qualifying for Priority Review, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.

The FDA offers certain programs, such as BTD and Fast Track designation, designed to expedite the development and review of applications for products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. For BTD, preliminary clinical evidence of the product indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If BTD or Fast Track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a BLA before the application is complete, and the product may be eligible for accelerated approval. However, receipt of BTD or Fast Track designation for a product candidate does not ensure that a product will be developed or approved on an expedited basis, and such designation may be rescinded if the product candidate is found to no longer meet the qualifying criteria.

The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, which includes determining whether it is effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP, to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved, and applications for new molecular entities and original BLAs are generally discussed at advisory committee meetings unless the FDA determines that this type of consultation is not needed under the circumstances. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.
12

After the FDA evaluates the BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”) created an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biologic products. The abbreviated pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. In March 2015, the FDA approved Novartis’s Zarxio as a biosimilar product to Amgen’s Neupogen. Since then, as of June 2018, eleven biosimilar drugs have received FDA approval.
Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has four program designations/approval pathways — Fast Track, BTD, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review — to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. The Fast Track designation provides pharmaceutical manufacturers with opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA reviewers during the product’s development and the ability for the manufacturer to do a rolling submission of the BLA. A rolling submission allows completed portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis. The BTD provides manufacturers with all of the features of the Fast Track designation as well as intensive guidance on implementing an efficient development program for the product and a commitment by the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in the review. The Accelerated Approval designation allows the FDA to approve a product based on an effect on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a product’s clinical benefit and generally requires the manufacturer to conduct required post-approval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit. The Priority Review designation means that the FDA’s goal is to take action on the BLA within six months, compared to ten months under standard review. The BLA submitted in 2018 for sacituzumab govitecan in patients with mTNBC has been accepted by the FDA and granted Priority Review. Refer to "Overview" above for additional information.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences with the biologic, submitting biological product deviation reports to notify the FDA of unanticipated changes in distributed products, establishment registration, compliance with cGMP standards (including investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP), and certain state chain of distribution pedigree requirements. Additionally, any significant change in the approved product or in how it is manufactured, including changes in formulation or the site of manufacture, generally require prior FDA approval, and even changes that may seem less significant must be evaluated under change control procedures to evaluate their potential impact on product quality and relative to the specifications on file with the FDA, and whether they trigger notification or approval requirements. The packaging and labeling of all products developed by us are also subject to FDA approval and ongoing regulation. Noncompliance with any regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures, and injunctive action. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Additionally, the FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. The distribution of prescription drugs and biologics is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the 
13

distribution of the products and product samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidances, and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Orphan Drug Act
To date, we have successfully obtained Orphan Drug designation by the FDA under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 for epratuzumab for NHL, yttrium-90-labeled clivatuzumab tetraxetan for pancreatic cancer, sacituzumab govitecan for SCLC and pancreatic cancer, labetuzumab for ovarian, pancreatic and SCLCs, milatuzumab for multiple myeloma and CLL, and veltuzumab for ITP and pemphigus. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer of the approved product cannot assure sufficient quantities. As a result, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not receive approval of drugs or biologics that have a different active ingredient for treatment of the diseases for which our products and product candidates are targeted.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates being developed, and products being marketed outside of the United States. We must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of our products in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required by the FDA for BLA licensure. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, we are subject to post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacturing, marketing, or distribution.
Other Regulatory Considerations
We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, The Clean Air Act, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and other current and potential future federal, state, or local regulations. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated.
We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our products and product candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy, and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities including pharmaceutical manufacturers from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in case or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, or either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease or order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to, among other 
14

things, arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. The term “remuneration” expressly includes kickbacks, bribes or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. The failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability in all cases. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
The False Claims Act prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a claims payment to, or approval by, the federal government that are false, fictitious or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes "any request or demand" for money or property presented to the federal government. Although we do not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to "cause" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, marketing products of sub-standard quality, or, as noted above, paying a kickback that results in a claim for items or services. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a "whistleblower" to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also implicate the False Claims Act. Although the False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or obtain, by any means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act,” created under the United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended or the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. CMS has the potential to impose penalties of up to $1.15 million per year for violations, depending on the circumstances, and payments reported under the Sunshine Act also have the potential to draw scrutiny on payments to and relationships with physicians, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute and other healthcare laws.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes, among other things, obligations, including mandatory contractual terms with respect to safeguarding the privacy, 
15

security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, and business associates. Among other things, HITECH made certain aspects of HIPAA’s rules (notably the Security Rule) directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain individually identifiable health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH created four tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal court to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights, or the OCR, has increased its focus on compliance and continues to train state attorneys general for enforcement purposes. The OCR has recently increased both its efforts to audit HIPAA compliance and its level of enforcement, with one recent penalty exceeding $5 million. Even where HIPAA does not apply, according to the United States Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers' personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 United States C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company's data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC's guidance for appropriately securing consumers' personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.
We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under this act, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
As noted above, we intend to bring sacituzumab govitecan to the United States market on our own for patients with mTNBC. Should our efforts become successful, we will need to build a commercial operation with a total sales force of approximately 50 to 60 agents anticipated along with about a 15 to 20 field-based medical affairs organization. At present, we have limited marketing and sales capabilities as we focus on developing our therapeutic product candidates. On January 1, 2018 we terminated agreements with third parties to market and provide distribution and customer support services for LeukoScan®. The Company discontinued the sale of LeukoScan® during the third quarter of 2018 to focus on its ADC business.
Our European operations are headquartered in Rodermark, Germany. Our distribution agreement with Logosys Logistik GmbH to package and distribute LeukoScan® in the EU was terminated January 1, 2018. 
Manufacturing
We operate a recombinant monoclonal antibody research manufacturing facility at our Morris Plains, New Jersey location. This facility is used for the research production of all of our therapeutic product candidates for clinical trials, and potentially for commercial production as well. 
For the commercial-scale manufacturing of sacituzumab govitecan ("IMMU-132") we have contracted with two outside contract manufacturing organizations to provide drug for the planned Phase 3 clinical trial and to support the commercial launch of sacituzumab govitecan in the United States. Accordingly, we have agreements with Johnson Matthey Pharma Services of Devens, Massachusetts for the manufacture of the linker-drug payload, and BSP Pharmaceuticals of Latina Scalo, Italy for the conjugation of the antibody with the linker-drug and fill/finish of the sacituzumab govitecan drug product. Presently, we have the capacity at our Morris Plains facility to manufacture sufficient quantities of the anti-Trop-2 antibody to support the commercial launch of sacituzumab govitecan in the United States. Together with our contract manufacturing organizations ("CMO") partners, we have already manufactured sufficient quantities of the drug product to complete the confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial of sacituzumab govitecan as a third-line therapy for patients with mTNBC. Additionally, we are currently in discussions with other CMOs to support our longer term needs for commercial-scale antibody production.
The Company discontinued the sale of LeukoScan® during the third quarter of 2018 to focus on its ADC business.
Manufacturing Regulatory Considerations
In addition to regulating and auditing human clinical trials, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of such products prior to providing approval to market a product. If, after receiving approval from the FDA, a material change is made in manufacturing equipment, location, or process related to an approved 
16

product, additional regulatory review may be required. We must also adhere to cGMP and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations.
Employees
As of June 30, 2018, we employed 185 persons on a full-time basis, 54 of whom were engaged in research, clinical research and regulatory affairs, 85 of whom were engaged in operations and manufacturing and quality control, and 46 of whom were engaged in finance, administration, sales and marketing. We believe that while we have been successful to date in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel, competition for such personnel continues to be intense and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to attract and retain the professionals we will need to grow our business. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent.
