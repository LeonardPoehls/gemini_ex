ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General 
Echelon was incorporated in California in 1988 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1989. With its Silicon Valley based global headquarters in Santa Clara, California, and regional sales offices throughout North America, Europe, and Asia, Echelon makes its products available throughout the world.
We are a pioneer in developing distributed intelligence, open-standard control networking platforms for Industrial Internet of Things ("IIoT") applications and delivering elements necessary to design, install, monitor and control highly reliable, scalable and secure communities of devices. Echelon's vision is one of low-cost monitoring and control technology in every industrial electrical device in the world and complete vertical solutions in the fastest growing market segments. With more than 140 million Echelon-powered devices shipped worldwide, Echelon helps its customers migrate existing legacy devices, and bring new devices and applications into a growing global Industrial Internet. 
In 2014 the Internet of Things ("IoT") market opportunity became increasingly apparent. The IoT refers to a network of physical objects, each containing a unique network address, which interact with each other to share information and to take action. IoT networks can run a variety of languages, or protocols, and be connected via wired or wireless links. The IoT can be further segmented into the Human Internet of Things (HIoT) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); the latter is Echelon's market focus. 
The IIoT refers to communities of rules-based, self-directed devices that reside in commercial or industrial environments and operate with little to no human interaction. Because of the harsh nature of these environments (e.g., extreme temperature, vibration, noise, humidity, dust) where connectivity can be intermittent, and because industrial applications demand high reliability, IIoT devices need to be more robust than consumer-oriented HIoT devices. Specialized requirements of the IIoT include no-compromise control capability, proven reliability, and hardened security. In addition, IIoT devices must be able to interact autonomously and function when disconnected from the Internet or a local access point. The IIoT will incorporate decades of existing and in-service infrastructure - deployed mechanical and digital vertical solutions ready to be connected. When these solutions are connected, they generally communicate with protocols developed many years ago, and often dedicated to specific applications.
Just as mainframe networking evolved to workgroup networking, which gave way to the corporate and consumer Internet, the IIoT represents a next big wave in technology. This market opportunity is driven by the convergence of control systems for lighting, HVAC, security, manufacturing, transportation, and more. The customers for IIoT products are themselves participating in highly fluid and competitive environments that prize lower costs, differentiated offerings, 
3

improved customer service, ubiquitous connectivity, and near-infinite analytic capabilities. The IIoT will unlock improvements in life quality, efficiency, safety, and more. Market analysts, such as those at IHS, Inc., project that the world market for Internet-connected devices could reach 50 billion by 2025, with the industrial segment representing the majority share of these devices.
IIoT products have long lifecycles and must operate under extreme conditions. They must also be secure to prevent unauthorized access and abuse that could cause environmental hazards or life-threatening situations. New systems running modern Information Technology protocols, such as IP, must interoperate with systems running mature Operational Technology protocols such as LONWORKS, BacNet and Modbus. Echelon’s control networking technology is purpose-built for industrial environments such as building automation, lighting and transportation.
Strategy
Today Echelon has two areas of business focus. Our original product lines are focused on developing, marketing, selling and supporting embedded components, modules, edge servers, and software that enable OEMs and other 3rd parties to quickly develop IIoT devices for their end users. Applications span a broad range of markets and products from HVAC systems to manufacturing equipment control, elevator control, transportation, and much more. 
Starting in late 2014, through the acquisition of Lumewave Inc., a wireless outdoor lighting control system provider with a track record of selling its solution to U.S. municipalities, universities, medical facilities and enterprises, we began developing and introducing a connected lighting platform geared primarily for outdoor applications. Targeting the fast-growing market for LED light sources, our Lumewave by Echelon connected lighting solution supports a range of applications for smart cities and smart enterprises. These applications can reduce energy consumption, enhance citizen and employee safety, improve livability in cities and make maintenance dollars go farther.
The Lumewave by Echelon products, which include individual lighting controllers, motion sensors, edge servers, and management and maintenance software, have since been incorporated into Echelon’s product portfolio along with the established Lumewave sales channels in North America. 
Embedded Components & Modules
Our IIoT embedded components and modules are utilized by a wide array of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and system integrators covering a broad spectrum of markets. Among the more significant of these markets are building automation systems, industrial and manufacturing equipment, lighting, and energy management systems. Sales levels track closely with new construction starts and tenant improvement cycles in the commercial buildings market. Consequently, industrial and manufacturing equipment is upgraded infrequently - approximately every 10 years or so. As with other areas of the IoT, numerous technical transitions are taking place that are impacting the market and our business. Most notably, legacy systems are becoming connected to the Internet so that ‘big data analytics’ can be performed and operational systems optimized in near real time. In addition, legacy ‘operational technologies’ such as RS485, BacNet and LonWorks are being augmented and in some cases supplanted by newer technologies such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and TCP/IP. Standards are very much in flux which can slow the adoption of these new connectivity technologies.
In keeping with these trends, in October 2013, we introduced our IzoT™ embedded platform - purpose-built for the IIoT. The IzoT platform allows control networking to be done using Internet Protocol ("IP") all the way to the end device. IzoT software can run on any processor in an environment providing UDP/IP socket connectivity; it allows a single device to be brought to market as a LONWORKS®, BACnet®, or other protocol-supporting device; and it can be used with an underlying wired or wireless communications link, such as Ethernet, RS-485, Wi-Fi, 15.4, or Echelon’s free topology (FT) standard. The IzoT platform allows customers to easily embrace their current installed solutions, extend those solutions with newer technologies if they choose, and enhance both existing and new connectivity systems with cloud-based analytics. In June 2014 Echelon began sampling the IzoT platform with evaluation kits, software, chips, modules, and routers. 

Both LONWORKS and the IzoT control networking platform consist of a three-tier architecture: a device tier, an edge server tier, and an enterprise software tier. At the device tier, industrial devices such as load controllers, lighting ballasts, meters, and thermostats, embed Echelon or third-party free topology (FT) or power line (PL) smart transceivers, enabling them to act as peers working together to collect data and take cooperative action. These individual devices are managed by edge servers, such as Echelon's Smart Servers. For example, when an edge server receives information from the local utility, such as a signal to shed electrical load, this information is transmitted across the twisted-pair network. The network 
4

devices then execute the control signal, resulting in a reduction of energy consumption while preserving a safe and comfortable work environment.
At the edge server tier, various control technologies and protocols are unified and supervised so that local decisions can be made at the device tier levels. An example of an edge server is the Echelon SmartServer. In general, the devices and control node tiers communicate using control protocols such as LONWORKS technology (ISO/EN 14908), BACnet, and Open Smart Grid Protocol (OSGP). OSGP is a family of standards published by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) that is optimized for smart grid applications used in conjunction with LONWORKS technology.
At the enterprise software tier, Echelon technology connects the edge server tiers to an enterprise software tier, commonly an information technology (IT) solution, so business rules can be established for the control system and operational data can be archived for later analysis. Our LONWORKS Control Network Software (LNS) is an example of an enterprise software tier product. Edge servers communicate with enterprise tier solutions using Internet protocols such as TCP/IP and web services. 

Lumewave by Echelon Connected Lighting Platform
Lighting, especially outdoor lighting, has been a key application for Echelon products and has been identified as potentially being one of the fastest growing market segments in the IIoT. Street, campus and commercial outdoor lights are important assets, providing safety and aesthetic value to their community. They also consume a significant amount of electricity - as much as 40% of a city's overall electricity budget. As a result, cities, campuses and commercial enterprises are responsible for a substantial portion of worldwide energy consumption and greenhouse gas production. Therefore, these entities are looking for ways to improve infrastructure to become more environmentally friendly, increase the quality of life for their residents and occupants, and reduce costs. 
Market research suggests that the transition from ‘analog’ to ‘solid state’ lighting is happening at an accelerating pace. In 2015, 19% of outdoor lights used LED light sources, which is expected to increase to 79% by 2025 according to the United States Department of Energy.
The Lumewave by Echelon connected lighting platform is a multi-application solution. The growing list of applications that Lumewave supports bring benefits in the areas of energy savings and sustainability, safety enhancement, livability and improved maintenance efficiencies. Example applications in each area include:

• | Sustainability/Energy savings. At the most basic level, Echelon's platform offers scheduling of lights on or off, the setting of dimming levels for individual or groups of lights, and intelligent lighting according to time of day, season, or weather conditions. Our systems include energy metering functions which allow a city to consider energy cost when optimizing system variables, and work with local utilities to minimize electricity charges


• | Safety. With our system lamp outages can be quickly spotted and repaired, and often predicted and repaired before they fail. Our adaptive lighting solutions can brighten lights in response to motion, direction of travel, traffic volumes and more. Our new white tuning concept allows cities to control the color of outdoor lights from soothing yellow to bright blue/white depending upon comfort and safety requirements. Our weather adaptive lighting concept adjusts schedules, brightness and color temperature based on weather conditions for optimal safety. 


• | Livability. Selective dimming, adaptive lighting, white tuning and fault identification all help ensure a more livable and attractive city, which is good for business and good for the citizenry. 


• | Maintenance efficiency. Our platform is fixture-agnostic so our customers are free to choose and connect virtually any light fixture from any catalog. We have both RF and powerline communication options to maximize aesthetics and performance. The platform allows for GPS options, automated topology optimization, and includes a powerful Central Management System (CMS) configuration and management features to make startup commissioning and management easy. Powerful reporting helps optimize and predict maintenance needs, monitor energy consumption and identify communication problems. Separate ‘application widgets’ support the needs of the specific applications described above. 

Echelon’s outdoor lighting control product portfolio includes:

• | Smart Transceivers: Outdoor lighting manufacturers can embed our power line smart transceivers into their outdoor light ballasts, drivers, and generators; or can use these transceivers to develop outdoor lighting controllers that serve as add-on products for existing dimmable ballasts and drivers within a luminaire. These components

enable command, control, and monitoring of each light. They communicate with the Echelon SmartServer edge server over existing power lines.

• | Outdoor Lighting Controllers: In order to address the retrofit market and to reduce the time needed to develop and deploy intelligent luminaires, Echelon provides its own brand of outdoor lighting controllers. Echelon outdoor lighting controllers support RF and power line (PL) based communications.


• | Motion Sensors: Echelon motion sensors work with outdoor lighting controllers to adjust light levels based on motion (ON/OFF or dimming).


• | SmartServer Edge Server: The Echelon SmartServer is a programmable gateway for connecting outdoor lighting segments to a centralized management system. The SmartServer provides rules for operation, invoking on/off time and sequencing, dimming time and percentage, and other functions.


• | PL/RF Bridge: Our PL/RF Bridge can be used to connect segments (groups) of outdoor lights to a SmartServer. The PL/RF Bridge uses a plug-and-play RF connection for simple, low-cost installation. Each virtual segment communicates with the SmartServer over existing power lines.


• | LumInsight Central Management Software ("CMS"): Our LumInsight CMS is used to manage the outdoor lighting network. Customers can choose to run an enterprise version of LumInsight or they can opt to access it as an Echelon hosted, cloud-based application. 


• | Third-Party Software: Third-party system software integrates with a city's enterprise applications and manages the outdoor lighting network using the SmartServer for control and communication. System software is available in hosted or server-based configurations.

Go-To-Market (Sales) Strategy
We sell our IIoT platform to OEMs in the building, lighting, and industrial controls markets directly and through distribution worldwide. These efforts are supported with application engineering, technical support, and industry experts working out of the U.S. as well as China, Japan, South Korea, India, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In outdoor lighting, in addition to selling our platform to lighting OEMs worldwide, in some geographies we also offer the complete Lumewave by Echelon platform solution to end customers such as municipalities, cities, campuses and commercial enterprises through local system integration partners and channel representatives.
Echelon organizes its sales resources by region. Within a region, sales personnel selling our embedded solutions work directly with large OEM customers such as Honeywell, Schneider, Siemens, Trane, and others. Sales personnel focused on our lighting platform work with distribution partners, regional manufacturers’ representatives, and regional system integrators. We will often "sell with" these partners by calling on end users such as municipalities and enterprises at their side.
Product Development 
Our future success depends in large part on our ability to enhance existing products, reduce product cost, and develop new products that offer technological competitiveness. We have made and intend to continue to make substantial investments in product development, while implementing strategies for overall product development cost reduction where appropriate. 
 Our strategy is to focus our product innovation efforts on enabling a platform that is versatile and capable of deployment in embedded and connected lighting markets. The platform is comprised of 3 tiers: 
•The enterprise management and cloud tier, 
•The edge server tier, 
•and the device tier. 
The platform is extensible to incorporate different types of end devices, protocols, services and business logic to drive sustainability/energy savings, enhance safety, increase efficiency, and manage livability. Key to the extensibility lies in the ability to incorporate selected new functionality and partner products. As an example, our recent proof of concept quickly incorporated weather data from the IBM Watson IoT platform and enabled us to study the balance of managing sustainability while enhancing safety for residents in a city. Also key to the extensibility lies in the ability to standardize at the appropriate layers, with hardware, operating systems, web capabilities, different physical and network protocols, new IoT messaging systems (like MqTT), data driven functionality, etc. Another key part of our product development strategy is balancing standardization with innovation, to optimize functionality, and intellectual property. As we build out this platform, we will aggressively file the appropriate patent disclosures to protect our innovation and intellectual property.

Our total expenses for product development were $9.3 million for 2017, and $8.3 million for 2016. Included in these totals were stock-based compensation expenses of $475,000 and $173,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
To date, we have not capitalized any software development costs from our development efforts. 
Marketing
Our marketing efforts focus on two key elements: awareness and demand generation/sales enablement. From an awareness perspective, we seek to generate visibility and credibility of our brand, the products and solutions that we offer, and the capabilities and benefits that they bring. Our marketing program comprises press releases, advertising, collateral, published technical and thought-leadership papers, newsletters, and customer case studies describing the benefits our customers are seeing from implementing our solutions. We also participate in industry events and trade shows, speak at relevant industry conferences, and are continually enhancing our global websites. 
Marketing also focuses on making it easier for our sales teams and our partners to sell our solutions. We do this through a variety of demand generation and sales enablement activities such as webinars/seminars, lead-generation from our participation at industry exhibitions and conferences, and the production of focused selling tools such as sales playbooks, competitive analyses, and sales presentations and training. We also actively participate in LONMARK® International, an association directly focused on the adoption of our products. 
We focus our sales teams using a systematic pipeline management process, whereby prospects are identified, qualified, and tracked, with the expectation that a portion of these opportunities are ultimately closed. 
Principal Customers 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had one customer that accounted for a significant portion of our revenues: Avnet Europe Comm VA (“Avnet”), the primary distributor of our IIoT products in Europe and Japan. For the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, the percentages of our revenues attributable to sales made to Avnet was follows: 

 | Year ended December 31,

Supply Chain
Our supply chain strategy uses design and manufacturing services from third parties where it reduces our costs and takes advantage of consolidated purchasing power. We limit our internal supply chain activities to quality inspection, system integration, custom configuration, testing, and order fulfillment. 
We maintain manufacturing agreements with Cypress Semiconductor related to the FT 3100 family of free topology transceivers. We also maintain manufacturing agreements with STMicroelectronics for production of our PL 3100 power line transceivers, and with Open-Silicon, Inc. for production of our Neuron 5000 microcontroller and the FT 5000 free topology receiver (which are manufactured at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company). 
For products requiring assembly, we utilize both third-party original design manufacturers (ODMs) and contract electronic manufacturers (CEMs). CEMs procure material and assemble, test, and inspect the final products to our design specifications. Our ODM partners perform the same services as CEMs but also provide design services to our product requirements.
Working Capital 
As of December 31, 2017, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $20.4 million, which was a decrease of approximately $2.7 million compared to working capital of $23.1 million as of December 31, 2016. 
Competition

We believe the markets for our products are competitive and becoming more competitive in terms of pricing, product features, and distribution. In each of our markets, our competitors include both small companies as well as some of the largest companies in the electronics industry, operating either alone or together with trade associations and partners. 
Our key competitors include established companies such as Cimcon Lighting, Inc., Cree Inc., Digi International, General Electric, LED Roadway Lighting, Maxim Integrated Products, Phillips, Siemens, Silver Springs Networks, STMicroelectronics, Telensa, Texas Instruments, and Tridium. We also see competition from embedded control companies like Freescale Semiconductor and Intel Corporation. In addition, the market has attracted and will continue to attract well-funded, venture-backed start-up companies. Key industry standard and trade group competitors include BACnet, Konnex, DALI, DeviceNet, HART, Profibus, ZigBee, and the ZWave Alliance.
To maintain and improve our competitive position, we must keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers and continue to develop and introduce new products, features, and services in a timely and efficient manner. The principal competitive factors that affect the markets for our products include: 

• | the price and features of our products such as adaptability, scalability, functionality, ease of use, and the ability to integrate with other products;


• | our ability to anticipate changes in customer requirements and to develop new or improved products that meet these requirements in a timely manner;


• | our product reputation, quality, performance, and conformance with established industry standards;


• | our customer service and support;


• | warranties, indemnities, and other contractual terms; and


• | customer relationships and market awareness.

Additionally, while our product implementations are proprietary to Echelon and are often protected by unique, patented processes, key technologies such as LONWORKS and IzoT are open, meaning that many of our basic control networking patents are broadly licensed without royalties or license fees. For instance, all of the network management commands required to develop software that competes with our LNS software are published. As a result, our customers are capable of developing hardware and software solutions that compete with many of our products. 
Government Regulation 
Many of our products and the markets and industries in which they are used are subject to U.S. and foreign regulation as well as local, industry-specific codes and requirements. For example, the power line medium, which is the 
8

communications medium used by some of our products, is subject to special regulations in North America, Europe, and Japan. In general, these regulations limit the ability of companies to use power lines as a communication medium. In addition, some of our competitors have attempted to use regulatory actions to reduce the market opportunity for our products or to increase the market opportunity for their own products. We have resisted these efforts and will continue to oppose competitors' efforts to use regulation to impede competition in the markets for our products. Our business might also be affected by other regulatory factors, including public utility commission or similar approvals and government mandates. This could lead to an extension of the sales cycle or even cancellation of a customer's order.
In addition, the market for our products might experience a movement toward standards-based protocols driven by governmental action. To the extent that we do not adopt such protocols or do not succeed in achieving adoption of other protocols we use as standards or de facto standards, sales of our products might be adversely affected. The adoption of voluntary standards or the passage of governmental regulations that are incompatible with our products or technology could limit the market opportunity for our products, which could harm our revenues, results of operations, and financial condition.
Proprietary Rights 
We own registered patents in the United States and in selected foreign countries. Many of the specific patents that are fundamental to LONWORKS technology have been licensed to our customers with no license fee or royalties.
We also hold several trademarks in the United States and select foreign countries, many of which are registered, including Echelon, Lumewave by Echelon, LumInsight, LonBuilder, LonTalk, LONWORKS, Neuron, LON, LonPoint, LonMaker, IzoT, LNS, LonManager, Digital Home, and NodeBuilder. 
Employees
As of February 28, 2018, we had 74 employees worldwide. About 49 employees are located at our headquarters in California and 12 employees are located in other offices throughout the United States. Our remaining employees are located in five countries worldwide, with the largest concentrations in China, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe relations with our employees are good.
