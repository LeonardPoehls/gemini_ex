Corporate History and Overview
 
Arkados Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1998. We underwent a significant restructuring after December 23, 2010 when substantially all of our then-existing assets were acquired by STMicroelectronics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ST Micro”). We currently carry out our activities through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Arkados, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Arkados”), and SolBright Energy Solutions, LLC (formerly Arkados Energy Solutions, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company (“SES”). We deliver technology solutions for building and machine automation and energy conservation and provide energy conservation services such as LED lighting retrofits, HVAC system retrofits and solar engineering, procurement and construction services. Our focus is towards the development and commercialization of an Internet of Things software platform that supports Big Data applications that complement our energy management services that lower costs for commercial and industrial facilities owners and managers. Our principal offices are located in Newark, New Jersey at the Economic Development Corporation at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
 
On May 1, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of SolBright Renewable Energy, LLC (“SolBright RE”), used in the operation of SolBright RE’s solar engineering, procurement and construction business (the “SolBright Assets”).
 
Our Markets
 
We seek to combine technology products and energy services that can position our company to be a leading provider for turnkey, cutting-edge solutions that immediately bring value to our customers by reducing costs, conserving energy and seamlessly integrating our product offerings into their existing systems. In order to effectively compete in today’s markets, we believe businesses need to continually focus on increasing productivity and efficiency - essentially getting more from less. One of the main areas where businesses can increase their efficiency is in the management of their long-term assets, particularly machinery and real estate. New technology advancements are able to help owners not only decrease the cost of ownership of these assets, but can also extend the life of them, both driving a much higher return on assets through increased output and reducing operational costs, thus increasing productivity and creating a high return on investment. Our solutions and software seek to capitalize on these technology enhancements by leveraging the network of physical objects connected to the internet that have the ability to process information and communicate with the external world. This area of technology is referred to as Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT), and we apply IIoT principals to help commercial customers increase their return on investment in facilities by reducing energy and maintenance costs, extending asset life and enhancing sustainability.
 
We believe, in terms of energy efficiency, that applying an IIoT approach by using internet-connected gateways and sensors to gather data, extract intelligence and enable more efficient usage of energy-consuming machines and devices can reduce energy expenditures by up to 25% and potentially much more when combined with implementing other energy conservation measures, such as conversion to LED lighting and installation of commercial solar. According to Gartner Group, there will be over 21 billion “things” connected to the internet by 2020, or in other words, 3 things per each human being on earth. The Gartner Group reported that the market size for services is expected to be $235 billion in 2016, with the majority coming from business services. In addition to energy efficiency, IIoT can reduce operating expenses, particularly operating and maintenance of long term assets. These hard expenses can equate to up to 10% of the overall operating budget, and any reduction in this cost falls directly to the bottom line for most businesses. Furthermore, IIoT can also enhance conditions within the workplace and increase productivity and sustainability. Many businesses are increasingly under pressure to continue to squeeze more productivity from operations in order to remain competitive, and social pressures are forcing businesses to do so while caring for our environment. According to a McKinsey & Company survey, 33% of companies stated that the top reasons for addressing sustainability include improving operational efficiency and lowering costs. By employing IIoT solutions to optimize conditions and increase productivity, businesses may be able to balance their goals to increase productivity with maintaining a cleaner, safer environment for workers and the community in which they operate.
 
Our corporate strategy is to leverage the capabilities of our technology platform to enhance the offerings of our service business and deliver a unique value proposition to our commercial customers defined in terms of return on investment, operational cost savings and unmatched service. Since beginning these undertakings in 2013, we have developed our ArkticTM software platform, which is unique in its open, scalable and interoperable design. We have integrated this software with hardware products of our partner, Tatung Company of America, Inc. (Tatung). Our services business has completed a number of large scale LED lighting projects and is expanding its services to include oil-to-natural gas boiler conversions and solar PV system installations. In addition, through our acquisition of the SolBright Assets, our strategic focus within the solar industry has been strengthened to significantly increase our design-build competencies for commercial solar projects to enable us to develop solutions to simplify technically challenging projects and deliver unparalleled service and quality to our clients.

● | Smart Manufacturing – data gathering and analysis to improve efficiency for manufacturing items. Data includes, but is not limited to, specific machine performance, input/output measurements and defect analysis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SES
 
SES, formerly known as AES, our energy conservation services subsidiary, was organized in 2013 and commenced operations in early 2015. SES provides energy conservation services and solutions, including solar engineering, procurement and construction, to commercial and buildings throughout the eastern United States. These services include energy consumption assessments and recommendations, as well as acting as the general contractor for light-emitting diode (“LED”) lighting retrofits, oil-to-natural gas boiler conversions and solar photovoltaic (“PV”) system installation. SES also markets and sells the technology solutions of Arkados to help building owners save money. SES sells its services directly to building owners and managers.
 
SES focuses on the systems throughout commercial and industrial buildings that consume large amounts of energy and operates as an engineering, procurement and construction general contractor, directly with commercial, institutional and industrial clients. After the completion of an energy efficiency audit, we offer customers recommendations on reducing energy demand costs (such as converting to LED lighting), reducing energy supply costs (such as installing a solar PV system) and improving the efficiency across all systems using our advanced building automation system. Additionally, SES’s aim is to increase the return on investment of heating plants and solar PV systems by offering long-term operating and maintenance agreements to clients, supported by cutting-edge tools built on the ArkticTM software platform.

As a consequence of our acquisition of the SolBright Assets, we have augmented our existing energy service business with solar engineering, procurement and construction. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, SolBright Energy Solutions, LLC, or SES, formally known as Arkados Energy Solutions, LLC, we have integrated all of these offerings, and changed the name of this operating subsidiary on June 23, 2017 to better reflect our newly acquired business.
 
SES is a turnkey developer of solar photovoltaic and solar thermal projects for long term, stable, distributed power solutions. We expect that SES’s primary market focus, capitalizing on SolBright RE’s historical activities, will be military and commercial scale projects, primarily in the 100 kWp to 5,000 kWp size range. SES will offer market assessment, design/engineering, installation, operation & maintenance/monitoring, financing and project ownership (where desired). SES will have distinct competitive advantages for ground, parking canopy and roof-top solar applications that ensure continuity with existing/new roof warranties. SES expects to offer a broad range of U.S. and internationally manufactured products, including zero-penetration rooftop solar solutions and innovative, space-leveraging parking canopy/parking garage solar solutions and ground mount systems.
 
From site assessments to permitting, incentive program guidance and advocacy, feasibility analyses, interconnection studies, lease or purchase agreement execution, full service financing, engineering, procurement, construction, and operations and maintenance after project commissioning, SES will strive to be a full service turnkey development firm that will offer, among other things, an industry unique single-point-of-contact for facilities managers to address both roofing and solar service and warranty related requirements.

We anticipate conducting the majority of our future sales in conjunction with the sales activities of SES. The scope of our sales activities for Arkados will include acting as a technical sales representative and providing technology support and implementation services and other services in support of the activities of SES.
 
SES
 
We developed a direct sales force to focus mainly on opportunities in the Northeastern region of the United States. These sales activities target commercial facilities owners and managers of virtually all kinds, including commercial office buildings, hospitals, schools, warehouses, hotels, etc. We expect to regularly work with partners in the construction and property management industries to reach the end customers. For the foreseeable future, we expect to maintain our focus on the current region and penetrate the large number of opportunities that exist there. We anticipate supplementing our direct sales force with other representatives and channel partners. The scope and development of our sales and marketing organization will depend, among other things, on the amount of capital available to us in the future.
 
With respect to SES’s solar business, our target market consists of commercial and industrial facilities’ owners and managers. While we can operate nationally, our primary geographic focus is the Eastern United States with a focus on health care, retail, office, education and municipal properties.
 
Strategic Relationships
 
Tatung Corporation
 
We continue to foster our relationship with Tatung and believe that this strategic relationship is a key competitive advantage for Arkados as we develop IIoT solutions.
 
SparkFund
 
In February 2017, we formed a partnership with SparkFund, a financial technology company located in Washington, DC to offer commercial and industrial facilities managers and owners a unique subscription model for energy conservation services. Through the As-A-Service model, the large capital expenditure associated with energy conservation measures, such as an LED lighting retrofit, is converted into a no-money-down subscription service. The benefits of this model include a reduction in upfront costs, a reduction in operations and maintenance costs and protection from obsolete materials. Additionally, the Company’s ArkticTM Energy Measurement and Verification (EM&V) platform is embedded with this subscription model to provide verification of energy savings with granular, real-time data gathering and provide insights into additional ways to reduce energy consumption. We believe that the introduction of the As-A-Service model is unique in that it revolutionizes how customers pay for energy conservation by eliminating the upfront cost associated with these activities, provides for a single monthly payment that covers installation, repairs, monitoring and ongoing service. Within this model, the ArkticTM EM&V platform offers customers a state-of-the-art, advanced Internet of Things platform that leverages data gathering and analytics to further reduce energy consumption.
 
Competition
 
Arkados
 
Arkados faces competition in the IIoT market for smart building/smart grid industries segments from multiple companies. There are several large players within the smart building market including, but not limited to, Johnson Controls, Siemens, Honeywell International and General Electric. These companies provide sophisticated building management systems for large commercial facilities and have essentially dominated the playing field for many years. We believe the landscape, however, is changing as technology advances and legacy systems become outdated and expensive to maintain. As the paradigm shifts to open and scalable solutions for building management, we believe that Arkados can gain a competitive advantage over time. Initially, we seek to integrate our systems as a value-added upgrade or enhancement to existing management systems. In the future, depending on conditions, we may seek to expand our offerings to compete head on with the larger players.

Additionally, there are early stage technology companies that represent direct competition to Arkados, including Optimum Energy and Enertiv. These companies are focused on data gathering and analytics to improve building efficiency and ultimately save money. We believe that we are unique initially in our approach. Our turnkey solutions are very flexible and highly customizable. Secondly, we believe that our business model and strategic relationships allow us to be price competitive, which drives higher return on investment for our customers. Finally, we believe that the best competitive advantage is high customer satisfaction and that our dedication to delivering the best, most innovative solutions to our customers ultimately allows us to compete favorably.
 
SES
 
The competition for LED lighting and building automation solutions is highly competitive. Large LED lighting companies such as General Electric, Phillips and Cree, as well as a large number of China-based manufacturers, represent significant competition to SES for LED lighting. In addition, companies such as Johnson Controls, Rockwell Automation and Schneider Electric represent significant competition to SES for building automation solutions. While these companies potentially represent sources of product for SES as a system integrator, there are situations where these companies are competing directly with SES, particularly for large commercial customer opportunities. We also face competition from a large number of Energy Savings Companies (“ESCOs”) in the Northeast region of the United States.
 
The competition related to the SolBright Assets business is highly competitive. Large companies such as SolarCity, SunPower, Vivint Solar and others represent significant competition to SES as fully-integrated solar companies. While these companies potentially represent sources of product for SES as an EPC company, there are situations where these companies are competing directly with SES, particularly for large commercial or utility-grade solar installations.
 
Research and Development
 
Arkados
 
Research and development in a rapidly changing technology environment is one of the keys to our success. We allocate resources as much as possible within our current operational limits to explore and exploit advancements in mobile and cloud computing, data processing technologies, wireless and broadband technologies and energy storage technologies that will lead to new products and services within our core competencies. These include the development of new software with a focus on M2M bridges, building networks and the Internet of Things within the smart building/smart machine areas via our strategic partnerships. We plan to engage in certain activities in pursuit of further commercial development as opportunities arise from these relationships.
 
In 2015, we introduced our Process and Event Management System for Smart Factory, or PEMS-SF. This system is intended to improve efficiency of a factory by use of Arkados’ software solutions residing in the factory’s computer systems and in Arkados’ cloud computing platform. This was the introduction of what we now call our ArkticTM software platform.
 
In May 2016, our focus shifted to applying our ArkticTM platform to the commercial building market to complement our energy services business, and we rolled out a new product for smart buildings called Energy Management Panel, or EMP. EMP is a measurement and verification process for quantifying the savings achieved by energy conservation measures. We expect to also continuously explore ways of improving this initial version of the EMP and expand new product offerings in the future.
 
Arkados and SES had aggregate research and development expenses of $68,439 and $337,375 for the years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
