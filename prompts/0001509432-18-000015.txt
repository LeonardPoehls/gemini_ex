Overview
RPX Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “RPX”, “the Company”, “our”, “we” or “us”) was incorporated on July 15, 2008 in the state of Delaware. We help companies reduce patent litigation risk and corporate legal expense through two primary service offerings: our patent risk management services and our discovery services. 
Our patent risk management services help companies reduce patent-related risk and expense through subscription-based services that facilitate more efficient exchanges of value between owners and users of patents compared to transactions driven by actual or threatened litigation. Our patent risk management membership clients pay an annual subscription fee and in return, receive access to substantially all of our patent portfolio as well as an array of services provided throughout their membership. Access to these services is available primarily through discussions with our professionals—particularly client services and our team of patent experts, as well as through a proprietary database, and attendance of regularly scheduled conferences.
In addition to our subscription-based patent risk management services, we underwrite patent infringement liability insurance policies to insure against certain costs of litigation. We use a reinsurance subsidiary company to assume a portion of the underwriting risk on the insurance policies that we issue on behalf of third party underwriters. Our insurance product helps policyholders manage and cap their risk of patent litigation. We are responsible for claims management and provide pre-litigation support to our policyholders based on our proprietary patent market data, which helps them manage their patent risk efficiently.
Our discovery services offering helps clients manage the costs and risks related to the legal discovery process through the use of technology and a comprehensive managed services model. Our approach is designed to streamline the administration of litigation matters, internal and external investigations, regulatory compliance, and other matters by offering a wide range of technology-enabled services including document collection and processing, document review, document production, and project management. Our discovery services clients include corporations and law firms.
Revenue from our patent risk management services constituted 76%, 80%, and 100% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenue from our discovery services constituted 24%, 20%, and 0% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as we began offering these services in 2016 as a result of our acquisition of Inventus.

The Markets
Patent Risk Management Market
The United States Constitution empowers Congress “to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries” through the grant of patents. Patent rights are a key component of a knowledge-based economy and are assets that can be bought, sold or licensed. We refer to the market in which participants exchange value — whether through the sale or licensing of patents — as the “patent market.”
Monetization of Patents
Historically, the following fundamental attributes of patents have enabled patent monetization:

• | Patents Provide a Limited Monopoly – In exchange for public disclosure of an invention, a patent owner is granted a monopoly over the use of a patented invention for a specified period, typically 20 years from the filing of the patent application.


• | Patents Confer Negative Rights – Patent rights are negative rights, meaning that they generally enable a patent owner to exclude others from commercial exploitation of a patented invention, regardless of whether the patent owner has the resources to manufacture or commercialize the invention. As the owner of a negative right, a patent owner has recourse through litigation to prevent others from using, making, offering for sale or selling the patented invention. Even when the patented invention is only a component of a broader product or service, the negative right can be enforced against any product or service that practices the claims of the patented invention.


• | Patents May Be Licensed and are Infinitely Divisible – A patent owner can authorize the use of the patented invention by one or more parties, typically in exchange for licensing fees. There is no legal limit to the amount of licenses a patent owner can provide to market participants.


• | Patents Are Assets That Can Be Transferred – A patent can be sold, in which case the negative right and monopoly associated with the patented invention are transferred to the buyer. When a patent is sold, the buyer’s negative rights may be constrained by licenses granted by previous owners.

More recently, several developments have increased opportunities for patent monetization and created an environment that is more favorable to investing in patents for the purpose of generating financial returns. These developments include:

• | Improved Search Capabilities – The entire database of United States patents is searchable on the Internet, enabling patent investors to quickly identify patents and their owners. The Internet also makes it much easier for patent owners to identify and research products and services that may practice the claims of their patented inventions.


• | Increasing Rate of Issuance of Technology Patents – Patents issued with class code identifiers that we classify as technology-related patents have nearly doubled in the past 10 years.


• | Overlap of Technology Patents – Because inventors can patent incremental improvements to existing inventions, multiple patents can apply to individual components of a product or service. Consequently, multiple patent owners may seek to extract license fees related to a single product or service. One example of this overlap of patents is semiconductor technology known as DRAM. Today, there are several thousand issued United States patents with “DRAM” specifically listed as a claim element. These DRAM patents span design, fabrication, testing and component technology including dies, capacitors, memory cells, transistors, integrated circuits, substrates and packaging. Each of those aspects may be covered by multiple patents that could be infringed by a DRAM semiconductor device or downstream product. Potential infringement of these patents could occur by anyone who designs, makes, uses or sells a product using this technology.


• | Technology Convergence – Complex products, such as smartphones, incorporate numerous technology components, and a constantly expanding set of features and services, including touchscreens, Internet access, streaming video, media playback, app downloads, and Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other connectivity options. The addition of features and services often exposes these products to additional claims of patent infringement.


• | Technology Diffusion – As the costs of certain technologies decline — especially computing and communications technologies — these technologies are often integrated into previously discrete products. For example, it is increasingly common to find Internet connectivity embedded into devices such as thermostats, security cameras, and garage door openers. The diffusion of new, patented technologies into these products may expose these products to claims of patent infringement.

2


• | More Companies Employing Patented Technologies – A growing number of companies, including non-technology companies, make, use and sell products or services that utilize patented inventions. For example, consumer banks now offer online and mobile banking and bill pay as a standard feature, which rely on numerous complex technologies that may be subject to many patents.


• | Specialized Appellate Court for Patent Cases – The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was created in 1982 to serve as the central appellate venue for patent-related cases. We believe this centralization of patent-related appeals has resulted in a more uniform application of patent law. In addition, various federal district courts have adopted patent-specific rules of procedure to facilitate patent litigation. These factors have created a more attractive environment for patent assertions.

These developments have caused significant capital to flow to companies specifically formed to acquire and monetize patent assets.
Emergence and Growth of Non-practicing Entities ("NPEs")
NPEs do not create or sell products or services that "practice" the claims of their patented inventions, but instead monetize patents through sale, licensing agreements, or the pursuit of litigation settlements. Some NPEs obtain patents through their own research and development efforts, while others accumulate patents through acquisitions. NPEs have become a major factor in the patent market and an important source of liquidity for patent owners.
Operating companies can incur significant costs to defend themselves against patent assertions by NPEs. At a minimum, companies faced with an assertion letter typically respond to the assertion letter and evaluate the patents being asserted. If the assertion proceeds to litigation, costs grow substantially. Because NPEs generally do not create or sell their own products or services, they are not susceptible to counter-assertion, a common defensive strategy in patent disputes between operating companies.
We believe that the amount of capital raised by NPEs is currently in the billions of dollars. Some of the large awards and settlements received by NPEs have resulted in extensive media coverage, contributing to a significant influx of capital into the patent market. NPE activity has decreased appreciably in the United States over the past few years, partially due to Patent Trial and Appeal Board challenges, as well as court decisions like the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. As a result, the risk that operating companies face from NPEs in some sectors has also decreased appreciably. However, as of December 31, 2017, more than 4,700 NPEs have been identified by RPX as active either in patent infringement litigation or patent transactions leading to patent litigation since 2005. In addition, many individual inventors and universities are also using litigation or threat of litigation to monetize patents. The threat of patent litigation brought by NPEs is also moving beyond the United States into jurisdictions such as Germany and China. 
Discovery Services Market 
Organizations across the world spend billions of dollars each year on the legal discovery process through internal discovery service resources or through outsourced options such as law firms or businesses that offer distinct discovery support services.
The proliferation of documents generated through electronic communications and office software products as well as increasing regulations and changes in discovery protocols around the world is accelerating growth in the discovery services. Additionally, we believe the evolution of other jurisdictions towards the United States discovery model will translate into increased growth in the international discovery services industry. We expect a majority of this expected growth to come from corporations as the buying decision for discovery services continues to shift toward the principal or litigant as opposed to external legal counsel.
Our Services and Benefits to Our Clients
Patent Risk Management Services
We have pioneered an approach to help operating companies mitigate patent risk and expense by serving as an intermediary through which they can participate more efficiently in the patent market. Clients that join our network and subscribe to our membership pay an annual subscription fee and gain access to our patent risk management services. The subscription fee is typically either based on a rate card that is calculated using a client’s revenue or operating income with adjustments for changes in the Consumer Price Index and other factors or a fixed fee that is risk-adjusted based on the client's patent risk profile. These fees remain generally in place over the term of a membership. By offering a predictable annual fee that does not change based on our patent asset acquisitions, we divorce the amount of fees charged from the value of our patent assets. We believe our pricing structure creates an alignment of interests with our clients, allowing us to be a trusted intermediary for operating companies in the patent market.
3

Defensive Patent Acquisition
The core of our patent risk management services is defensive patent acquisition, in which we acquire patents, licenses to patents, patent rights, and agreements for covenants not to sue, which we collectively refer to as "patent assets." These patent assets are being or may be asserted against our current and prospective clients. When we acquire patent assets, we generally provide to our clients non-exclusive sub-licenses to those patent assets. We acquire patent assets from multiple parties, including operating companies, individual inventors, NPEs, universities, and bankruptcy trustees. We also acquire patent assets in different contexts, including when they are made available for sale or license by their owners or to resolve threatened or pending litigation against our clients or prospective clients.
We have not asserted and will not assert our patents. We have never initiated patent infringement litigation, and our clients receive guarantees that we will never assert patents against them. We consider this guarantee to be of paramount importance in establishing trust with our clients. In addition, because we have minimal risk from infringement claims, we are able to engage in more transparent discussions regarding the value of patent assets with patent owners. Our ability to engage in transparent discussions with both operating companies and patent owners allows us to act as an effective intermediary between participants in the patent market. As a result, we provide a conduit through which value can flow between market participants at lower transaction costs than is typically the case when patents are monetized through litigation or the threat of litigation.
As a part of our patent risk management services, we provide extensive patent market intelligence and data to our clients. Clients can access this market intelligence and data through our proprietary web portal and through discussions with our client services team. This market intelligence and data helps our clients better understand past and potential patent acquisition transactions, relevant litigation activity, and key participants and trends in the patent market. In a market with limited publicly available data on pricing and terms of licenses and litigation settlement, we believe our data and market intelligence is a valuable resource for our clients and prospects. 
Insurance
Our patent infringement litigation expense insurance service is designed to give businesses greater control of the unpredictable financial impact of patent litigation. We believe that our access to historical data on patent transactions, litigations, and settlements uniquely enables us to assess and price the insurance based on a company’s risk profile. We assume a portion of the underwriting risk on insurance policies that we issue on behalf of third party underwriters. The insurance product enables policyholders to better manage and mitigate the risk of patent litigation. Pricing is based on an actuarial model that calculates an individual client’s insurance premium based on its projected annual frequency (i.e., number of claims during the policy term) and severity (i.e., the expenses it might incur to resolve a claim).
Benefits to Our Patent Risk Management Clients
In general, operating companies join our network to reduce their risk of patent litigation and the expected costs associated with patent risk management. In exchange for an annual subscription fee, which in some instances has been less than the costs of a single patent assertion, our clients gain access to the following benefits:

• | Reduced Risk of Patent Litigation – Clients reduce their exposure to patent litigation because we continuously assess patent assets available for sale or license and acquire many that are being or may be asserted against our clients or potential clients. Our clients have no litigation risk related to the patents that we own.


• | Cost-Effective Licenses – Our annual subscription fee is typically based on a client’s historical financial results or a fixed fee which is risk-adjusted for the client's general patent risk profile, which provides predictability for us and our clients. We believe our approach is different than the pricing strategies of traditional patent licensing businesses, which generally negotiate license fees based on the perceived relevance of their various patent portfolios to each licensee. We believe our approach to pricing also provides clients with non-exclusive license rights to our large and growing portfolio of patent assets at a lower cost than they would have paid if these patent assets were owned by other entities.


• | Reduced Patent Risk Management Costs – Clients can reduce their ongoing patent risk management costs by supplementing their internal resources with our database of information and extensive transaction experience relating to the patent market. We actively monitor the patent market to understand the availability of patent assets for sale or license, the identity of the owners and licensors of these assets, the terms by which they may be available and the technologies to which these assets apply. We also track relevant litigation activity and identify key participants and trends in the patent market. As part of their subscription, our clients have access to this information through our proprietary web portal and through discussions with our client services team.

Discovery Services
Our managed services model helps our clients effectively minimize operational burden, risk, and the overall cost of the legal discovery process. Our technology allows us to host millions of documents for review across multiple geographies. We offer our clients any or all of the following services: 

• | Data Collection and Forensics - We offer multiple collection platforms and techniques aimed at harvesting potentially relevant data in the most cost effective ways. We have trained internal experts and partners available to perform data collection in conformance with country-specific data protection laws.


• | Data Processing and Analytics - We offer advanced data filtering techniques and processing services using various sophisticated third-party software, data analytics, and technology assisted review.


• | Data Hosting - Clients have access to technology-enabled document review software.


• | Project Management - Internal subject matter experts trained in discovery procedures and protocols are available to assist clients with project setup and configuration, and to help clients navigate and utilize industry best practices. Our project management experts have a unique combination of legal acumen and technical expertise to deliver the most efficient services to our clients.


• | Production - We offer high volume data production capacity and printing, copying, and scanning services.


• | Document Review Services - We utilize a variable workforce model to manage and staff the activities required to review large document collections in legal matters. These tasks include sourcing qualified legal professionals for project-based work, developing appropriate review protocols and quality control procedures, and providing guidance to outside counsel throughout the various stages of the complex discovery process.

Information Technology
Our software and technology infrastructure allows us to provide secure, high-reliability capabilities to our clients such as high volume data intake, data hosting, and data review platforms. Our network infrastructure is a key component of our technology footprint since our review services offering is within our private hosted environment where we manage significant volumes of client data across thousands of client matters. Client matters may entail millions of documents, terabytes of data and complex structured data from databases as well as unstructured data from email archives. We operate data centers domestically and internationally that provide secure access to our software environment and client databases. Information security is critically important given the sensitive nature of the data provided by our clients.
Benefits to Our Discovery Services Clients
Corporations and law firms seek our discovery services to organize responsive data for various types of legal and compliance matters in a legally defensible manner, thereby reducing both litigation risk and cost. In exchange for our discovery services fees, our clients receive the following benefits:

• | Reduced Cost of Litigation – Clients reduce their litigation costs by using our technology-enabled services to eliminate redundant data and organize it in a manner that reduces the number of responsive documents that need to be reviewed by attorneys, which is typically the single largest cost of most legal matters. In addition, our technology allows the client to repurpose previously processed data from individual custodians that may be responsive to multiple matters, thereby compounding cost savings and administration time.


• | Increased Visibility into the Discovery Process – We use a managed service model to offer our proprietary discovery services management platform, which adds clarity, visibility, and efficiency to our clients' legal discovery process. Seamless integration with industry-leading third-party applications helps our clients focus on critical information early in the litigation life cycle through efficient access to important data.


• | Secure Hosting of Data – Our clients' electronic data is stored in a secure, monitored environment. We maintain strict security standards and procedures to protect our clients' sensitive, and often confidential, information.


• | Access to Support Services – Our global network of trained experts help our clients maximize their use of our software tools. We have experienced personnel in major markets across the country and internationally in order to provide localized support that is responsive to our clients' needs.

Our Strategy
Our mission is to reduce risk and cost for corporate legal departments through data-driven decision-making, technology, and market-based solutions. A significant part of that mission is to transform the patent market by establishing RPX as the essential intermediary between patent owners and operating companies and by providing complementary technology-focused discovery services. Our strategy includes the following:

• | Growing Our Client Network – We intend to grow our client network by developing relationships with companies that have experienced patent litigation, often initiated by NPEs, or the need for discovery services, and continuing to demonstrate the value of our services.


• | Acquiring Additional Patent Assets – We intend to continue to acquire patent assets that are being or may be asserted against current and prospective clients and to increase our role and expertise in the patent market. We believe our disciplined approach to valuing and acquiring patent assets will allow us to continue to deploy our capital in an efficient and effective manner to maximize the patent risk management benefits to our clients.


• | Focusing on Client Services – We intend to deliver the highest levels of service and support to our clients to build and maintain trusted relationships and high levels of client retention.


• | Developing Proprietary Technology Services for Our Clients – We intend to continue to enhance our proprietary web portal to provide our clients with the most current intelligence and data on patent acquisition opportunities, relevant litigation activity and key market participants and trends that affect their patent risk exposure. We also continually improve our discovery services to maximize throughput and improve analytical capabilities.


• | Syndicated Transactions – On certain occasions, clients ask us to acquire patent assets that we would not otherwise purchase using our capital (due to the size or limited applicability of the portfolio). In these instances, we facilitate syndicated transactions that include contributions from participating clients in addition to their annual subscription fees. Similar to other acquisitions, these syndicated deals are designed to efficiently share resources and collectively reduce litigation risk. Transaction participants may pay a fee to RPX for structuring, negotiating and executing the transactions.


• | Offering Patent Infringement Litigation Insurance – We offer insurance policies for businesses interested in management of their exposure to patent infringement claims.


• | Deterring Abusive Patent Assertion Practices - We believe we can improve the efficiency of the patent market, lower unnecessary costs, and deter abusive patent assertion practices by performing systematic, high quality prior art searches on asserted patents, challenging the validity of low quality patents at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and performing other activities to improve patent quality.


• | Enhancing Our Capabilities Through Complementary Acquisitions – We occasionally evaluate the potential acquisition of businesses and technologies in adjacent markets that can enhance our capabilities and offerings to our clients.


• | Expand Our International Operations – We will continue to investigate expansionary efforts for our patent risk management and discovery services to allow us to help our current and future clients manage litigation risks and legal costs internationally.

Our Client Network
Patent Risk Management Client Network
We have built a network of clients that includes some of the world’s most prominent technology companies, as well as many smaller and emerging companies. As of December 31, 2017, we had more than 330 patent risk management clients, consisting of our patent risk management network members and insurance clients. We provide patent risk management services to approximately 450 companies, including those insured under policies sold to venture funds and industry trade associations.
We believe our patent risk management services are broadly applicable to companies that design, make or sell technology-based products and services as well as to companies that use technology in their businesses. Our clients are active in a broad range of industries including automotive, consumer electronics, personal computers, e-commerce, financial services, software, media content and distribution, mobile communications and handsets, networking and semiconductors.
Client Services
Our client services team identifies potential clients by prioritizing operating companies that have been subject to patent infringement claims initiated by NPEs. The membership team is responsible for educating potential clients on the benefits of our patent risk management services and explaining how these services mitigate patent risk and reduce 
6

expense. After we have communicated our business model to a prospective client, we continue to work to develop a relationship of trust with the executives responsible for patent-related matters. We do this in part by providing information to each client on the overall patent market as well as specific updates on patent activity that affect their industry and company. We proactively monitor litigation activity and patent transactions that impact these prospective clients. In addition, we conduct a variety of marketing efforts to establish ourselves as a leading source of information in the patent market, including industry conferences and seminars, public relations, and industry research.
After a company has become a client, the relationship is also handled by our client services team. The client services team maintains frequent dialogue with senior executives of our clients so we can better understand their patent risk profiles. We also proactively monitor litigation and patent sales activity related to each of our clients to help us direct our patent asset acquisition efforts. Our continued success and our ability to retain clients depend on our clients perceiving risk from NPEs and on our ability to demonstrate that our patent risk management services reduce their costs in patent matters.
Our client services team also provides clients with patent market intelligence and updates on our patent asset acquisitions over the term of their memberships. We provide this information through direct discussions with our clients and also share information with them through our proprietary web portal. We believe our frequent interactions allow us to optimize our patent asset acquisition decisions, thus supporting our client retention efforts.
Patent Asset Portfolio and Patent Asset Acquisition
We acquire patent assets that are being or may be asserted against current or prospective clients. As of December 31, 2017, we had deployed approximately $2.4 billion of our capital and the capital of our clients to acquire patent assets. Of this amount, deployment of our capital totaled approximately $1.1 billion. Since inception, approximately three-fourths of our $1.1 billion patent acquisition capital has been deployed for the purchase of patent rights and the balance deployed for the purchase of patents. Acquisitions of patent rights generally benefit only those operating companies that are clients at the time of the acquisition, whereas acquisitions of patents may benefit both current and future clients. Our patent asset acquisition efforts have been broadly diversified across the following market sectors: automotive, consumer electronics, personal computers, e-commerce, financial services, software, media content and distribution, mobile communications and handsets, networking and semiconductors. 
The substantial majority of our 440 acquisitions through December 31, 2017 involved patent assets that we believed were relevant to multiple clients and/or prospective clients and were funded with our own capital resources. We occasionally identify patent assets that cost more than we are prepared to spend of our own capital resources or that may be relevant only to a very small number of clients. In these circumstances, we may structure and coordinate a transaction in which certain of our clients contribute funds that are in addition to their subscription fees in order to acquire those patent assets. We refer to such transactions as syndicated acquisitions. These syndicated acquisitions may secure rights just for those clients who elect to participate in the transaction or, if we contribute capital, may secure rights for all of our clients.
We apply a disciplined and proprietary methodology to valuing patents that is based primarily on our judgment regarding the costs our clients might incur from potential assertions of those patents if we were not to acquire them. A number of factors are involved in our valuation methodology, including the degree to which patent claims may describe technologies incorporated in clients’ products or services, pricing expectations that we obtain from open market activities, the revenues our clients generate from products or services potentially affected by the patents, the extent to which the patents would be attractive to NPEs, and the legal quality of the patents and their likely validity. As part of our approach, we also consider the degree to which we have already acquired patent assets in similar market sectors that were being or may be asserted against each of our clients. We also closely monitor new case law and new legislation that can affect the underlying patent value.
Because each acquisition of a patent asset may create value for more than one client, we believe our acquisitions of patent assets create a network effect: expanding our portfolio of patent assets results in greater patent risk mitigation for our clients, which we believe leads to greater opportunities to retain and grow our membership base.
Our patent analysts, our patent acquisitions team, and our patent acquisitions approval committee employ a rigorous and disciplined approach to evaluating acquisition opportunities. 
In situations where patents are already being asserted or litigated against our current or prospective clients, the evaluation process begins with a detailed review of the patents. Depending on the value of the transaction, the complexity of the evaluation process, the number of patent assets in the portfolio, and the quality of the information provided by the seller or plaintiff, the patent acquisition process can range from as short as several weeks to more than six months.
7

We believe our position as a leading acquirer of patent assets gives us extensive access and visibility into the patent market. We closely track patent assets that become available on the market and, as of December 31, 2017, we had reviewed more than 9,300 patent portfolios since our inception. We believe our position in the market gives us direct access to a diverse group of patent sources, including brokers, individuals, companies, universities and law firms, all of which are familiar with our approach and acquisition criteria. We believe this familiarity provides us early notice of patent portfolios that are entering the market.
Discovery Services Client Network
Historically, in-house corporate legal departments of major corporations and top-tier law firms have demonstrated the most significant need for our discovery services. We have key relationships with Fortune 500 and other large domestic and multinational corporations in a variety of industries including financial services, energy and utilities, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, technology, telecommunications, retailers, and others. We also provide services to Am Law 100 firms domestically, Magic Circle firms in the United Kingdom, and leading regional and specialty law firms domestically and internationally. As of December 31, 2017, we had over 1,000 discovery services clients. 
Competition
Patent Risk Management
In our efforts to attract new clients and retain existing clients, our patent risk management services compete primarily against established patent risk management strategies within those companies. Companies employ a variety of other strategies to attempt to manage their patent risk, including internal buying or licensing programs, cross-licensing arrangements, patent-buying consortiums or other patent-buying pools and engaging legal counsel to defend against patent assertions. As a result, we spend considerable resources educating our existing and prospective clients on the potential benefits of our services and the value and cost savings they provide.
In addition to competing for new clients, we also compete to acquire patent assets. Our primary competitors in the market for patent assets are other entities that seek to accumulate patent assets, including NPEs such as Wi-LAN, Allied Security Trust, and PanOptis. We also face competition for patent assets from operating companies, including current or potential clients that seek to acquire patents or license patent assets in connection with new or existing product offerings.
We believe we compete favorably with other patent risk management services based on a number of factors:

• | our alignment of interest and strong relationships with our clients resulting from our pricing structure and guarantee never to assert our patent assets against our clients;


• | our ability to reduce the costs associated with patent market transactions by engaging in more transparent negotiations based on the economic value of patent assets rather than discussions involving litigation or the threat of litigation;


• | our ability to increase efficiency and expand our role in the patent market as our client network and capital available for patent asset acquisitions grows;


• | our access to data regarding our analysis of the patent market and patent litigation; and


• | our extensive patent market expertise, relationships, and transaction experience.

Discovery Services
The discovery services market is highly fragmented, extremely competitive, and continually changing as technology and the legal and regulatory environments evolve around the world. Our competitors include larger businesses that offer a distinct discovery service offering such as Epiq, KLDiscovery, Consilio, and FTI Consulting. We also compete with smaller regional discovery services businesses as well as discovery services practices inside large and mid-sized law firms and professional services firms. Competition is primarily based on quality of service, level of data security, geographic reach, technology innovation, and pricing. We believe we generally compete favorably with other discovery services in these factors.
Intellectual Property
We rely primarily on a combination of confidentiality, license and other contractual provisions and trademark, trade secret and copyright law to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology. We rely on an internal team as well as third-party vendors and advisors to assist with the maintenance and prosecution of the patent assets and applications that we acquire.

Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 300 employees. Of the total employees, 111 are engaged in discovery services operations, 85 in sales, marketing and corporate development, 53 in legal, finance, and administration, 26 in patent acquisition and research, and 25 in system development and information technology. Of these employees, approximately 85% were employed in the United States and approximately 15% were employed internationally. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we consider current employee relations to be good.
