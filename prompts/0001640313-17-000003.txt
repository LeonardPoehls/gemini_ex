Item 1. Business
Our Company
Amplify Snack Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company", "we", "us" and "our") is a high growth, snack food company focused on developing and marketing products that appeal to consumers’ growing preference for better-for-you ("BFY") snacks. Our anchor brand, SkinnyPop, is a highly-profitable and market-leading BFY ready-to-eat ("RTE") popcorn brand. Through its simple, major allergen-free and non-GMO ingredients, SkinnyPop embodies our BFY mission and has amassed a loyal and growing customer base across a wide range of food distribution channels in the United States. In September 2016, we acquired Crisps Topco Limited ("Tyrrells Group") and its international portfolio of premium BFY snack brands. This acquisition allows us to broaden our international customer reach, diversify our product and brand portfolio and realize the benefits of operating scale. In April 2015, we acquired Paqui, LLC ("Paqui"), an emerging BFY tortilla chip brand and in April 2016, we acquired Boundless Nutrition, LLC ("Boundless Nutrition"), which manufactures and distributes its Oatmega protein snack bars and Perfect Cookie products to natural, grocery, mass and food service retail partners across the United States. These acquisitions allow us to leverage our infrastructure to help us grow into adjacent snacking sub-segments with innovative BFY brands. We believe that our focus on building a portfolio of exclusively BFY snack brands differentiates us and will allow us to leverage our platform to realize material synergies across our family of BFY brands, as well as allow our retail customers to consolidate their vendor relationships in this large and growing category.
Corporate History
On July 17, 2014, SkinnyPop Popcorn LLC was acquired by investment funds affiliated with TA Associates, L.P., a leading growth private equity firm ("TA Associates"). This transaction is hereinafter referred to as the "Sponsor Acquisition". The business of SkinnyPop Popcorn LLC prior to the Sponsor Acquisition is hereinafter referred to as the "Predecessor". The business of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, including SkinnyPop Popcorn LLC, following the Sponsor Acquisition is hereinafter referred to as the "Successor".

On August 4, 2015, we completed our initial public offering ("IPO") in which 15,000,000 common shares from the 75,000,000 common shares then issued, were sold by selling stockholders to the public at a price of $18.00 per share. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in this offering. In May 2016, we completed a secondary public offering, in which 11,500,000 common shares were sold by selling stockholders to the public at a price of $11.25 per share. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in this offering.
Industry Overview 
Our brands primarily compete in the salty snack segment, which includes products such as potato chips, tortilla chips, popcorn, cheese snacks and pretzels. BFY brands within the salty snack segment have recently experienced a higher rate of growth relative to the overall salty snack segment. Growth in BFY snacks is driven by various factors, including the increasing importance of snacking in many consumers' diets, heightened awareness of the importance of a healthier diet, coupled with increased understanding and focus on the importance of nutrition to long-term health and wellness. Consumers are increasingly aware of their snacking choices, are demanding great tasting BFY products that can meet specific dietary requirements and are focusing on products with simple and more easily understandable ingredients. 
Brand Products
Our products are comprised of our cornerstone brand, SkinnyPop, in addition to Tyrrells, Paqui, Oatmega, Thomas Chipman, the Wholesome Food Company and Lisa’s Chips. Our SkinnyPop and Tyrrells brands have established themselves in the North America region and Europe region, respectively, whereas Paqui, Oatmega, Thomas Chipman, The Wholesome Food Company and Lisa's Chips are still emerging and we believe these brands possess high growth potential within their respective markets. We refer to these brands collectively as "Emerging Brands".
The SkinnyPop brand was launched in 2010 and is one of the leading brands in the growing RTE popcorn category. SkinnyPop starts with three core ingredients: popcorn, sunflower oil and salt. The SkinnyPop portfolio is currently comprised of six flavors: Original, White Cheddar flavor, Sea Salt & Pepper, Naturally Sweet, Jalapeno and Dusted Dark Chocolate flavor. We offer our products in a variety of bag sizes and pack types which are sold across all channels. While the ingredients are simple, we have developed a unique combination of proprietary cooking processes and 
1

carefully selected premium ingredients to achieve a desirable taste profile. Additionally, our SkinnyPop products are major allergen-free, non-GMO, gluten-free, and contain no artificial flavors or preservatives, making them a tasty BFY snack. In 2016 we expanded the SkinnyPop brand beyond our core RTE product offerings and now offer microwaveable popcorn and SkinnyPop popcorn cakes. Currently our SkinnyPop product offerings are sold primarily in the United States and Canada, however with the acquisition of Tyrrells, it is our intent to expand the brand beyond North America.
In September 2016, we acquired the Tyrrells brand, based in Herefordshire, England. Tyrrells is an international manufacturer of BFY snack food businesses that manufactures and markets products in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and other international markets. The Tyrrells brand has a presence in snack food categories including, kettle cooked potato chips or crisps, vegetable crisps, premium popcorn and tortilla chips. Tyrrells differentiates itself in the BFY market place by leveraging its premium ingredients, proprietary cooking methods, and humorous brand personality and packaging. Tyrrells products are also made without artificial ingredients or preservatives. Tyrrells Crisps are also spun as part of the hand cooking process, which not only gives them a characteristic crunch, but also a lower fat content relative to most conventional potato chip brands. We expect to leverage our North American distribution channels to further expand the Tyrrells brand with a limited launch at select retailers in late 2017 and a full-scale launch in early 2018. 
Emerging Brands
The Paqui brand was created in 2007 and acquired by us in 2015. Paqui, the name of which is derived from the Aztec word that means “to be happy”, produces tortilla chips that taste great but are also non-GMO, gluten-free, trans fats-free, cholesterol-free and contain no artificial preservatives or flavors. Paqui currently offers seven core flavors: Sea Salt Delights, Nacho Cheese Especial, Wild Wild Ranch, Roasted Jalapeño, Grilled Habanero, Cool Salsa Verde and Haunted Ghost Pepper. Paqui provides our entry point into the multi-billion dollar tortilla chip sub-category, where we believe no clear BFY market leader has emerged. In early 2016, we officially launched the Paqui brand nationally across the United States and Canada, which are currently the only two markets the product is sold. 
In April 2016, we acquired Boundless Nutrition, which manufactures and distributes Oatmega protein snack bars and a line of BFY cookie products, formally branded as the Perfect Cookie. The Oatmega protein bar is currently offered in eight flavors which we will seek to expand upon in the future. We believe the Oatmega protein bar is unique as it is one of the few, if not only, protein bars that contains grass fed whey protein and uses EPA and DHA Omega 3s. Our Oatmega bars are non-GMO and certified gluten-free. The Oatmega protein bar is currently sold in the United States. 
We launched a line of Oatmega Kids protein bars in four kid-friendly flavors including Chocolate Chip, Chocolate Peanut Butter, Cinnamon Roll and Peanut Butter & Jelly, to a limited number of retailers in the United States. These bars were developed specifically for kids and contain a good source of Vitamin D, E and magnesium in addition to grass-fed whey protein and EPA and DHA Omega 3s.
We also leveraged the Oatmega brand to further our growth of the BFY cookie product line with a reformulated BFY cookie under the Oatmega brand name. The Oatmega Cookie line is comprised of three flavors: Peanut Butter, Chocolate Chip and White Chocolate Macadamia. The Oatmega Cookie contains grass-fed whey protein, EPA and DHA Omega-3s and is certified gluten free.
With the acquisition of Tyrrells Group in September 2016, we acquired the Thomas Chipman and Wholesome Food Company brands, which are manufactured in Australia by our wholly-owned subsidiary Yarra Valley Snack Foods Pty. Limited ("Yarra Valley"), and Lisa’s Chips, manufactured in Germany by our wholly-owned subsidiary Aroma Snacks GmbH & Co. KG ("Aroma").
Thomas Chipman Organic Chips are certified organic and gluten free and include a range of corn chips, potato chips and vegetable chips, with over 20 product offerings. The Wholesome Food Company offers a range of innovative snacks designed to appeal to the health-conscious consumer including popcorn and legume based chips. Products sold through the Wholesome Food Company contain no artificial ingredients, and are gluten and GMO free.
Aroma Snacks manufacturers hand cooked potato chips that are sold under four brand names. Lisa's Chips, Lisa's Organic Chips, 3 Länder Chips and Mr. Jo's. 
Product Innovation
Given that we compete in the global snack category, innovation is, and will continue to be, an important component of our growth strategy moving forward. Our innovation strategy is based on our ongoing research into consumers’ BFY snacking needs and preferences. We will continue to conduct extensive consumer research in order to develop successful new products including concept testing, marketing and trend analysis and consumer product testing. As 
2

part of our innovation process our product development teams collaborate with nationally recognized third-party flavor houses and product development firms for new product development. We conduct our own proprietary consumer research to identify and improve upon winning new product concepts. 
Customers and Distribution
Historically, we marketed our products predominantly throughout the United States to a variety of channels including natural and conventional grocery, drug, convenience, club, mass merchandise and a variety of alternative channels. In connection with our acquisition of Tyrrells Group in September 2016, we expanded our geographic footprint into the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and Asian markets who sell through many of the same channels that we have previously sold through. It is our intention to utilize these recently acquired sales and distribution channels to expand our anchor brand SkinnyPop to international markets as well as expand the Tyrrells brand into the North American market. 
Our largest customer, Costco Wholesale, accounted for approximately 22%, 31%, 36% and 33% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the period from July 17, 2014 to December 31, 2014 and the period from January 1, 2014 to July 16, 2014, respectively. A second customer, Sam’s Club, an affiliate of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for 12%,18%, 20% and 22% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the period from July 17, 2014 to December 31, 2014 and the period from January 1 2014 to July 16, 2014, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the period from July 17, 2014 to December 31, 2014 and the period from January 1, 2014 to July 16, 2014.
We sell our products directly to retailers and to distributors. 
Direct Sales: We rely largely on our direct sales force in combination with traditional sales brokerage firms to sell to and service our customers directly. 
Distributor: The majority of our natural grocery retailers, some regional conventional grocery retailers and the majority of our alternative channels are serviced through independent food distributors that purchase products from us for resale to retailers.
Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing organization is aligned by brand and is responsible for driving each brand’s growth and performance. As we continue to build out our brands, we aim to create impactful marketing communication and activation plans to drive awareness, trial and repeat purchases and cement brand loyalty. We believe we have significant opportunity to grow our business by increasing communications about our brands and product attributes to a wider audience of consumers. 
Supply Chain
Raw Materials: We produce snack foods which primarily fall into five product categories: popcorn, potato chips and potato crisps, vegetable chips and vegetable crisps, tortilla chips and protein bars. The principal ingredients required to manufacture our SkinnyPop popcorn include popcorn kernels, sunflower oil, and seasonings. Our assortment of potato chip/crisp and vegetable chip/crisp offerings are primarily produced using potatoes, root vegetables, sunflower oil and a variety of seasonings. The principal ingredients within our tortilla chip offerings are ground corn, canola oil and flavor seasonings. Our protein bars are produced using a mix of grass-fed whey protein, oats and various natural ingredients. Our packaging supplies consists of flexible film, cartons, trays, card cases, pallet wrap and pouches. All of our raw materials are purchased according to rigorous standards to assure food quality and safety. These raw materials are generally available in adequate quantities from numerous sources and are often contracted out from three months up to two years. Refer to Note 11 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for more detailed information related to our purchase commitments. Our North American operations utilize at least two suppliers for all their key ingredients except for our grass-fed whey which is purchased from a large multi-national supplier. Internationally we single source many of our key ingredients but consider these ingredients to be readily available from multiple suppliers. We visit with major suppliers to procure competitively priced, quality materials that meet our standards.

Manufacturing: In North America, where we produce SkinnyPop popcorn, Paqui tortilla chips and Oatmega protein bars and cookies, we rely on independent manufacturers referred to as co-manufacturers in our industry to manufacture our products. Outsourcing allows us to operate an asset-light business model and focus our efforts on innovation, marketing and sales. Our co-manufacturers are regularly audited by third parties and are required to follow rigorous food safety guidelines. We believe our co-manufacturers have the capacity to meet our current and near-term supply needs. We monitor capacity and performance of our manufacturing partners and will qualify alternate suppliers as needed. We have two different arrangements with our co-manufacturers. For the majority of our business, we supply the raw materials and the co-manufacturer is paid an agreed-upon tolling charge for each item produced. Other co-manufacturers supply items to us for a negotiated price. 
In conjunction with the Tyrrells Group acquisition, we acquired approximately 156,000 square feet of manufacturing, warehousing and office space. We maintain two manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom, and one manufacturing facility in both Germany and Australia. Our batch fried potato crisps, which is our most significant potato crisp category, can be manufactured in all facilities, but several of our other product categories can only be manufactured at one of the six facilities. 
Quality Control: Our products are manufactured in facilities that have programs and controls in place regarding consistent quality and food safety. Product attributes, such as taste, aroma, texture and appearance are regularly monitored. Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMP") and comprehensive Food Safety programs are designed to produce a safe, wholesome product. Our suppliers are required to have equally robust processes in place and confirm their compliance with product specifications with Letters of Guaranty and Certificates of Analysis for shipments of raw materials to be used in our Products. Finally, random samples of our finished goods are sent regularly to a third-party laboratory for testing. All of our co-manufacturers and four manufacturing facilities maintain at least one form of global food safety quality standards, such as SQF, BRC, ISO 9001, IFS, ISO22000, and SQS. 
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment and face competition in each of our product categories. We have numerous competitors of varying sizes, including manufacturers of private-label products, as well as manufacturers of other branded food products, that compete for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. We compete with large conventional consumer packaged foods companies such as Frito Lay, Inc. and Walkers, both of which are subsidiaries of PepsiCo, Inc., The Kellogg Company, ConAgra Foods, Inc., General Mills, Inc. and Snyder’s-Lance, Inc. (including its subsidiary Kettle Foods Inc.). We also compete directly with smaller, local or regional BFY snack companies including Popcorn Indiana, Angie’s, Cliff, Luna, and Quest, as well as private-label products manufactured by retailers, some of which are our customers. An increasing focus on BFY products in the marketplace will likely increase these competitive pressures within the category in future periods.
Competitive factors in our industry include product quality and taste, brand awareness and loyalty among consumers, product variety, ingredients, interesting or unique product names, innovation of on-trend snacks, product packaging, access to supermarket shelf space, reputation, price, advertising, promotion and nutritional claims. We believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of these factors.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 550 full-time employees and 73 part-time employees, as compared to 45 employees at December 31, 2015. The increase in our headcount from December 31, 2015 is primarily related to our acquisition of Tyrrells in September 2016, which contributed 470 full-time employees and 71 part-time employees to our headcount. We are continuing to build our workforce with experienced individuals in order to serve our operations. Our Yarra Valley Snack Foods subsidiary, located in Australia is subject to collective bargaining regulations. We are currently evaluating our obligations under those regulations, including any obligation to engage employees under an Enterprise Bargaining Agreement with Yarra Valley employees. We believe our employee relations to be satisfactory.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We market and sell our products primarily under the SkinnyPop, Tyrrells, Paqui and Oatmega brand names, each of which is registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as in various other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our Tyrrells, Thomas Chipman, the Wholesome Food Company, Mr. Jo's and Lisa’s brands also maintain non-U.S. trademarks. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brand and our consumers’ 
4

favorable perception of our products and brands. Certain of our other marks are also pending registration in U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
Our web content and the domain names, including www.amplifysnackbrands.com, www.skinnypop.com, www.tyrrellscrisp.co.uk, www.oatmega.com, www.paqui.com, www.yarravalleysnackfoods.com and www.lisachips.com are owned by us and the content is copyright protected. We also rely on unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations, continuing innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. We expect to continue to renew trademarks that are important to our business.
 Government Regulation
Along with our co-manufacturers, brokers, distributors and ingredients and packaging suppliers, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations in the United States by federal, state and local government authorities. In the United States, the federal agencies governing the manufacture, distribution and advertising of our products include, among others, the FTC, the FDA, the USDA, Food Safety Inspection Service, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar state and local agencies. Under various statutes, these agencies, among other things, prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety and regulate our marketing and advertising to consumers. Certain of these agencies, in certain circumstances, must not only approve our products, but also review the manufacturing processes and facilities used to produce these products before they can be marketed in the United States. 
Our operations and products are also subject to foreign and provincial regulation and oversight by governmental agencies in the countries in which we operate, including the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom, the European Food Safety Authority in the European Commission, the Federal Ministry of Food Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV) in Germany, the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources in Australia and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the Ministry of Agriculture in Canada, which regulate the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising and labeling of the products we manufacture, including food safety standards. We have been, and we may be, required to alter certain products to comply with foreign or other regulatory standards.
We are subject to U.S and foreign labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Our operations, and those of our contract co-manufacturers, distributors and suppliers, also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters. 
We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we presently comply in all material respects with the foregoing laws and regulations. There can be no assurance, however, that future compliance with such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may be subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA, the USDA or other federal, state, or foreign regulatory authorities, the repeal of laws or regulations, or more stringent interpretations or enforcements of current laws or regulations, from time to time in the future. We cannot predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we predict what effect additional government regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. Such laws could, however require the reformulation of products, the recall, withholding or discontinuance of products, the imposition of additional record keeping requirements, the revision of labeling, advertising or other promotional materials, and changes in the level of scientific substantiation needed to support claims. Any or all such government actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Segment Information

On September 2, 2016, the Company completed the acquisitions of Tyrrells Group, a diversified international company that manufactures and markets BFY snack foods. As a result of this transaction, management determined that it operates in two operating and reportable segments. Our North America and International segments both operate in the large and growing global snack food category and whose brands and products are offered in the natural and conventional grocery, drug, convenience, food service, club, mass merchandise and other channels. The two snack food segments are reported separately based on differences in manufacturing and distribution methods and economic characteristics. We consider our chief executive officer to be our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") because he regularly reviews operating results of the North America and International segments for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Net sales and operating income are the primary performance 
5

measures used by our CODM for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance of our segments, along with non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization. 
Certain expenses such as administrative costs required to operate effectively as a public company, professional fees, corporate-related insurance costs, personnel costs of our executive team, and certain individuals within our finance and human resource departments have been excluded from our individual segments profitability measures, along with transaction-related expenses that are not part of revenue generating activities. For purposes of our segment results, revenue is attributed to individual geographies on the basis of the physical location of where the sales occur. Prior to our acquisition of Tyrrells Group, we operated as one segment with all of our business primarily conducted in North America.
