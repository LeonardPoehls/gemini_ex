ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd. (the Company or the Registrant), an exempted Bermuda limited liability company, through its subsidiaries (collectively, OneBeacon, we, us, or our) is a specialty property and casualty insurance provider that offers a wide range of insurance products in the U.S. primarily through independent agencies, regional and national brokers, wholesalers and managing general agencies. As a specialty underwriter, we believe that we will generate superior returns compared to an underwriter that takes a more "generalist" underwriting approach, and that our knowledge about specialized insurance products, targeted industries, classes of business, risk characteristics and limited number of specialized competitors provides us with a competitive edge when determining terms and conditions on individual accounts. 
Historically, we offered a range of specialty, commercial and personal products and services. However, as a result of a series of transactions over the past several years, we are now focused exclusively on specialty businesses. The most recent of these transactions was the sale of certain of our run-off business consisting of assets, liabilities and capital related principally to our non-specialty business, including the vast majority of our asbestos and environmental reserves (Runoff Business), to an affiliate of Armour Group Holdings Limited (Armour Ltd), which closed on December 23, 2014 (Runoff Transaction). See Note 2—"Acquisitions and Dispositions" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
With the closing of the Runoff Transaction, we completed our transformation into a specialty insurance company and our balance sheet and risk profile have changed significantly. Our exposure to claims from policies related to the Runoff Business, such as commercial general liability, including asbestos and environmental exposures, and workers compensation policies, is now limited to the value of the surplus notes issued in conjunction with the transaction, which have a fair value of $71.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Our outstanding reserves as of December 31, 2016 for 2004 and prior accident years total $0.1 million and for accident years prior to 2007 total $6.9 million.
As of both December 31, 2016 and 2015, OneBeacon had $3.6 billion of total assets and $1.0 billion of common shareholders' equity. OneBeacon wrote $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in net written premiums in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Our reportable segments are Specialty Products, Specialty Industries, and Investing, Financing and Corporate. The Specialty Products segment is comprised of ten active underwriting operating segments representing an aggregation based on those that offer distinct products and tailored coverages and services to a broad customer base across the United States. The Specialty Products segment also includes the exited Crop underwriting operating segment. The Specialty Industries segment is comprised of six active underwriting operating segments representing an aggregation based on those that focus on solving the unique needs of a particular customer or industry group. The Investing, Financing and Corporate segment includes the investing and financing activities for OneBeacon on a consolidated basis, and certain other activities conducted through the Company and our intermediate subsidiaries. See Note 12—"Segment Information" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Our parent company, White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. (White Mountains), is a holding company whose businesses provide property and casualty insurance, and certain other products. As of December 31, 2016, White Mountains owned 76.1% of our common shares.
Our headquarters are located at 26 Reid Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. Our U.S. corporate headquarters are located at 605 North Highway 169, Plymouth, Minnesota, 55441 and our registered office is located at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda.
The claims-paying (or financial strength) ratings assigned to our principal insurance operating subsidiaries as of February 27, 2017 ranged from "Good" to "Strong" or "Excellent." See "Item 1. Business—Ratings" for additional discussion of our ratings.
Our Operating Principles
We strive to operate within the spirit of four operating principles. These are:
Underwriting Comes First. An insurance enterprise must respect the fundamentals of insurance. There must be a realistic expectation of underwriting profit on all business written, and demonstrated fulfillment of that expectation over time, with focused attention to the loss ratio and to all the professional insurance disciplines of pricing, underwriting and claims management.
1

Maintain a Disciplined Balance Sheet. The first concern here is that insurance liabilities must always be fully recognized. Loss reserves and expense reserves must be solid before any other aspect of the business can be solid. Pricing, marketing and underwriting all depend on informed judgment of ultimate loss costs and that can be managed effectively only with a disciplined balance sheet.
Invest for Total Return. Historically, accounting tends to hide unrealized gains and losses in the investment portfolio and over-reward reported investment income (interest and dividends). Regardless of the accounting, we must invest for the best growth in after tax value over time. In addition to investing our bond portfolios for total after tax return, that will also mean prudent investment in a balanced portfolio consistent with leverage and insurance risk considerations.
Think Like Owners. Thinking like owners has a value all its own. There are stakeholders in a business enterprise and doing good work requires more than this quarter's profit. But thinking like an owner embraces all that without losing the touchstone of a capitalist enterprise.
Business Overview
Generally, property and casualty insurance companies write insurance policies in exchange for premiums paid by their customers (the insureds). An insurance policy is a contract between the insurance company and the insured where the insurance company agrees to pay for losses suffered by the insured, or a third party claimant, that are covered under the contract. Such contracts are often subject to subsequent legal interpretation by courts, legislative action and arbitration. 
We write both property insurance and casualty insurance in our Specialty Products and Specialty Industries segments. Property insurance generally covers the financial consequences of accidental losses to the insured's property, such as a business's building, inventory and equipment or personal property. Casualty insurance (often referred to as liability insurance) generally covers the financial consequences of a legal liability of an individual or an organization resulting from negligent acts or omissions causing bodily injury, property and/or economic damages to a third party. Premiums from ocean and inland marine, certain commercial multiple peril, and fire and allied lines generally represent our property (short-tail) lines of business, and claims from such business are typically reported and settled in a relatively short period of time. Premiums from general liability, workers compensation, commercial auto liability and certain commercial multiple peril policies generally represent our casualty (long-tail) lines of business, and claims from such business can take years, even decades, to settle. In addition, there are some coverages that do not fall into the “Property” or “Casualty” insurance definitions, including surety which typically has few losses but those can be very severe, as well as accident and credit insurance. 
2

Our various lines of business generally fall into three major categories, which reflect how we view the primary risk classification associated with each line: property lines, casualty lines, and other lines of business. Net written premiums by line of business for 2016, 2015 and 2014 consist of the following:

 | Year ended December 31,
Line of business | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
 | ($ in millions) 
Property Lines: | | | | | 
Ocean and Inland Marine | $ | 176.0 | | | $ | 190.1 | | $ | 201.9 
Commercial Multiple Peril and Auto Physical Damage | 88.9 | | | 94.6 | | | 82.0 
Fire and Allied | 36.5 | | | 39.3 | | | 44.7 
Total Property Lines | 301.4 | | | 324.0 | | | 328.6
Casualty Lines: | | | | | 
General Liability | 344.9 | | | 334.8 | | | 402.1
Workers Compensation | 78.1 | | | 86.1 | | | 83.7 
Automobile Liability | 67.6 | | | 88.4 | | | 91.4 
Other Casualty | 59.9 | | | 51.8 | | | 40.3 
Total Casualty Lines | 550.5 | | | 561.1 | | | 617.5
Other Lines: | | | | | 
Accident and Health | 131.4 | | | 151.1 | | | 149.8
Credit and Other | 62.6 | | | 59.0 | | | 58.0 
Surety | 54.6 | | | 50.7 | | | 28.9 
Crop | 0.2 | | | (9.3 | ) | (1) | 34.1 
Total Other | 248.8 | | | 251.5 | | | 270.8
Total net written premiums | $ | 1,100.7 | | | $ | 1,136.6 | | $ | 1,216.9

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1) | Amount primarily relates to the premiums ceded under a 100% quota share agreement to reinsure the remaining net Crop Business exposure for the 2015 reinsurance year.

We derive substantially all of our revenues from earned premiums, investment income, and net realized and change in unrealized investment gains on investment securities. Written premiums are an operating metric and represent the amount we charge to an insured in order to provide coverage under an insurance contract, which are recognized as earned premiums within revenue over the period of time that insurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the life of the policy). A significant period of time often elapses between receipt of insurance premiums and payment of insurance claims. During this time, we invest premiums, earn investment income, and generate net realized and change in unrealized investment gains on investment activities.
Insurance companies incur a significant amount of their total expenses from policy obligations, which are commonly referred to as claims or losses. In settling policyholder losses, various loss adjustment expenses (LAE) are incurred such as insurance adjusters' fees and litigation expenses. Loss and LAE are categorized by the year in which the claim is incurred, or “accident year.” In the following calendar years, as we increase or decrease our estimate for the ultimate loss and LAE for claims incurred in prior accident years, we will record favorable or adverse loss reserve development which is recorded in the current calendar year period. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition expenses, such as commissions paid to agents and premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employee compensation and benefits. The key measure of relative underwriting performance for an insurance company is the combined ratio. An insurance company's combined ratio is calculated by adding the ratio of incurred loss and LAE to earned premiums (the loss and LAE ratio) and the ratio of policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses to earned premiums (the expense ratio). A combined ratio under 100% indicates that an insurance company is generating an underwriting profit. However, when considering investment returns, insurance companies operating at a combined ratio of greater than 100% can be profitable.

Geographic Concentration
Substantially all of our net written premiums are derived from business produced in the United States. We produced business in the following geographies during 2016, 2015 and 2014:

 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
California | 18.2 | % | | 17.6 | % | 16.4 | %
New York | 11.5 | | | 10.4 | | 10.0 | 
Texas | 7.0 | | | 6.4 | | 6.7 | 
District of Columbia | 6.0 | | | 6.0 | | 5.3 | 
Florida | 4.7 | | | 5.1 | | 5.7 | 
Other(1) | 52.6 | | | 54.5 | | 55.9 | 
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1) | No other individual state accounts for more than 5% of net written premiums for 2016, 2015 or 2014.

Marketing and Distribution
We offer our products and services through a network of approximately 2,300 independent agents, regional and national brokers, wholesalers and managing general agencies. We selectively enter these relationships with producers who demonstrate an understanding of our target markets, our capabilities and the specialized needs of their clients. We believe this selective distribution approach creates greater insight into the underwriting and management of the risks associated with our particular lines of business. Further, we believe agents and brokers will continue to represent a significant share of the business we desire going forward.
Underwriting and Pricing
We believe there must be a realistic expectation of attaining an underwriting profit on all the business we write, as well as a demonstrated fulfillment of that expectation over time. Consistent with our "Underwriting Comes First" operating principle, adequate pricing is a critical component for achieving an underwriting profit. We underwrite our book with a disciplined approach towards pricing our insurance products and are willing to forgo a business opportunity if we believe it is not priced appropriately.
We actively monitor pricing activity and measure our use of tiers, credits, debits and limits. In addition, we regularly update base rates to achieve targeted returns on capital and attempt to shift writings away from lines and classes where pricing is inadequate. To the extent changes in premium rates, policy forms or other matters are subject to regulatory approval (see "Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters—General" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business—Regulation may restrict our ability to operate"), we proactively monitor our pending regulatory filings to facilitate, to the extent possible, their prompt processing and approval. Lastly, we expend considerable effort to measure and verify exposures and insured values.
Competition
Property and casualty insurance is highly competitive. Our businesses each compete against a different subset of companies. In general, we compete in one or more of our businesses with most of the large multi-line insurance companies, such as Chubb, AIG, Beazley, CNA, Hartford, Liberty Mutual, Travelers and Zurich. We also compete with most specialty companies, such as Axis, Tokio Marine HCC, Navigators, Markel, RLI, and W.R. Berkley, as well as various local and regional insurance companies and niche carriers. 
The more significant competitive factors for most of our insurance products are price, product terms and conditions, agency and broker relationships, claims service, company scale and financial stability. Our underwriting principles and dedication to independent distribution partners are unlikely to make us the low-cost provider in most markets. While it is often difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products, we believe that providing superior specialty products to satisfy market needs and relying on agents and brokers who value our targeted expertise, superior claims service, and disciplined underwriting establishes a competitive advantage.
7

Claims Management
Effective claims management is a critical factor in achieving satisfactory underwriting results. We maintain an experienced staff of claims handlers and managers located throughout our operating territories.
We have dedicated claims managers and adjusters for many of our specialty businesses. These individuals ensure that we have the appropriate level of expertise to handle claims often involving complex issues. Within the claims organization, we also use various shared services to both more efficiently manage costs and ensure we are delivering superior claims results. These services include: shared non-specialty property and casualty insurance claims adjusters, operational and information technology support, subrogation and recovery support, medical and legal bill review, a special investigation unit to detect insurance fraud, and dedicated legal support. 
We have adopted a total claims cost management approach, which gives equal importance to appropriately controlling claims handling expenses, legal expenses and claims payments. This approach enables us to deliver effective and efficient claims results. We collect and review various metrics to analyze our claims handling results. 
Our claims department utilizes an online claims system to record reserves, payments and adjuster activity. The workstation also helps claim handlers identify recovery potential, estimate property damage, evaluate claims and identify fraud. We maintain a paperless claim file system. 
Catastrophe Risk Management and Reinsurance Protection
Catastrophes are severe losses resulting from a wide variety of events. Examples of catastrophes include losses caused by earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes and other types of storms and terrorist acts. While our exposure to catastrophe losses has decreased meaningfully as a result of our repositioning in recent years as a specialty-only company, we are still exposed to catastrophe losses. The timing and size of catastrophe losses are unpredictable and the level of losses experienced in any year could be material to our operating results and financial condition. The extent of losses caused by a catastrophic event is a function of severity and the amount and type of insured exposure in the affected area. In the normal course of business, our insurance subsidiaries seek to limit losses that may arise from catastrophes or other events through individual risk selection, imposing deductibles and limits, limiting our concentration of insurance in catastrophe-prone areas such as coastal regions and reinsuring with third-party reinsurers. 
We use models (primarily AIR Worldwide Touchstone version 4.1) to estimate potential losses from catastrophes. We use the model output in conjunction with other data to manage our exposure to catastrophe losses based on a probable maximum loss forecast to quantify our exposure to an extreme catastrophe event.
Our insurance subsidiaries enter into reinsurance contracts to protect their businesses from losses due to concentration of risk and to limit losses arising from catastrophic events. We utilize a general catastrophe reinsurance treaty with unaffiliated reinsurers to manage our exposure to large catastrophe losses. Effective May 1, 2016, we renewed our property catastrophe reinsurance program through April 30, 2017. The program provides coverage for our property business as well as certain acts of terrorism. Under the program, the first $20.0 million of losses resulting from any single catastrophe are retained, with 100% of the next $110.0 million of losses resulting from the catastrophe being reinsured. Any part of a catastrophe loss in excess of $130.0 million would be retained in full. In the event of a catastrophe, our property catastrophe reinsurance program is reinstated for the remainder of the original contract term by paying a reinstatement premium that is based on the percentage of coverage reinstated and the original property catastrophe coverage premium. We anticipate that the $130.0 million limit is more than sufficient to cover the maximum hurricane and earthquake losses with a modeled 0.4% probability of occurrence (1-in-250-year). This $130.0 million limit is consistent with the limit that our previous catastrophe reinsurance program provided.
Our property catastrophe reinsurance program does not cover property losses resulting from any nuclear events or biological, chemical or radiological terrorist attacks. Also excluded are losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism committed by an individual or individuals acting on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest as defined under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (the Terrorism Act).
We also purchase property-per-risk reinsurance coverage to reduce large loss volatility. The property-per-risk reinsurance program reinsures 100% of losses in excess of $3.0 million, up to $100.0 million. Individual risk facultative reinsurance is purchased above $100.0 million. The property-per-risk treaty provides one limit of reinsurance protection for losses in excess of $3.0 million up to $100.0 million on an individual risk basis for certified acts of foreign terrorism committed on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest. However, any nuclear events, or biological, chemical or radiological terrorist attacks are not covered.
8

In addition to the corporate catastrophe and property-per-risk reinsurance protection, we also purchase dedicated reinsurance protection for certain lines of business. Our specialty property business purchases a dedicated property catastrophe program providing 100% coverage for $34.0 million of loss in excess of $6.0 million of loss, which inures to the benefit of the broader property catastrophe reinsurance program described previously. This treaty limit cannot be reinstated. 
In addition to the coverage provided under these treaties, we utilize a number of other catastrophe and general insurance treaties covering specific lines of business. See Note 4—"Reinsurance" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for descriptions of the significant types of our reinsurance agreements.
As reinsurance contracts do not relieve us of our obligation to our policyholders, collectability of balances due from reinsurers is critical to our financial strength.
Our current third party reinsurance programs provide varying degrees of coverage for terrorism events. Our overall terrorism exposure is impacted by the Terrorism Act, which is a federal program administered by the Department of the Treasury that provides for a shared system of public and private compensation for commercial property and casualty losses resulting from events that reach the threshold for losses ($140 million in 2017 and increasing $20 million in subsequent years until the threshold becomes $200 million in 2020) and are certified as an act of terrorism by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States. The current program was signed into law on January 12, 2015 and is authorized through December 31, 2020. See Note 4—“Reinsurance” of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further description of the Terrorism Act, including our estimated retention level.
We closely monitor and manage our concentration of risk for terrorism losses by geographic area. We control our exposures so that total maximum expected loss from a terrorism event within any half-mile radius in a metropolitan area or around a target risk will not exceed $450 million on a pre-tax basis before considering the federal government participation under the Terrorism Act. Reports monitoring our terrorism exposures are generated quarterly. In addition, our underwriting process evaluates all potential new business to determine if it would add exposure to an already existing concentration of risk or would individually add significant risk. As a result, we believe that we have appropriately limited our exposure to losses from terrorist attacks. Nonetheless, risks insured by us remain exposed to terrorist attacks and, even considering the coverage provided by the Terrorism Act, the possibility remains that losses resulting from future terrorist attacks could prove to be material.
Loss and LAE Reserves
We establish loss and LAE reserves that are estimates of amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses in the future for insured events that have already occurred. The process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and is always inherently uncertain. See Item 7—"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates," as well as Note 1—"Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Insurance Operations" and Note 3—"Unpaid Loss and LAE Reserves" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting for loss and LAE. 
The following table reconciles loss and LAE reserves determined on a statutory basis to loss and LAE reserves determined in accordance with GAAP as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 as follows:

 | December 31, 
 | 2016 | | 2015
 | ($ in millions)
Statutory reserves | $ | 1,192.7 | | | $ | 1,203.8
Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and LAE(1) | 172.9 | | | 186.0 | 
GAAP reserves | $ | 1,365.6 | | | $ | 1,389.8

Investing, Financing and Corporate
Investing, Financing and Corporate primarily consists of investing and financing activities, as well as other assets and liabilities, and general and administrative expenses and interest expense incurred at the holding company level.

Investing
Our traditional investment philosophy is to maximize long-term total returns (after-tax) while taking prudent levels of risk and maintaining a diversified portfolio, subject to our investment guidelines and various regulatory restrictions. Under this approach, each dollar of after-tax investment income and realized and unrealized investment gains and losses is valued equally.
Invested assets are not allocated to our Specialty Products or Specialty Industries reportable underwriting segments since we do not manage our invested assets by segment. Invested assets, net investment income, and net realized and change in unrealized investment gains (losses) related to our Specialty Products and Specialty Industries segments are included in the Investing, Financing and Corporate segment since these assets are available for payment of losses and expenses for all segments.
Substantially all of our investment portfolio is managed under an agreement with White Mountains Advisors LLC (WM Advisors), a registered investment advisor and wholly owned subsidiary of White Mountains. See Note 15—"Related Party Disclosures" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our investment portfolio mix as of December 31, 2016, consisted in large part of high quality, short duration fixed maturity investments and short-term investments. During the third quarter of 2016, we established a portfolio of high-yield fixed maturity investments. We also maintain a portfolio of common equity securities, and other investments, including surplus notes, hedge funds and private equity funds. Our management believes that prudent levels of investments in common equity securities, other investments and high yield fixed maturity investments are likely to enhance long-term after tax total returns. 
WM Advisors' fixed maturity investment strategy is to purchase securities that are attractively priced in relation to their investment risks. WM Advisors manages the interest rate risk associated with holding fixed maturity investments by actively managing the average duration of the portfolio to achieve an adequate after tax total return without subjecting the portfolio to an unreasonable level of interest rate risk. WM Advisors has established relationships with third party registered investment advisers to invest in taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities and high-yield fixed maturity investments. 
WM Advisors' looks to enhance long term after-tax total returns by investing a portion of the portfolio in common equity securities and other investments. A majority of our common equity securities represent passive exchange traded funds (ETFs) that seek to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the performance of broad market indices. WM Advisors has established a relationship with a third party registered investment adviser to invest in publicly-traded common equity securities, excluding our ETFs. 
Financing
Debt and the related interest expense on debt also are not allocated to or managed by segment and are included in the Investing, Financing and Corporate segment.
2012 Senior Notes
In November 2012, OneBeacon U.S. Holdings, Inc. (OBH), an intermediate holding company of OneBeacon, issued $275.0 million face value of 4.6% senior unsecured notes (the 2012 Senior Notes) through a public offering, with the proceeds used to repurchase OBH's then existing outstanding senior notes, and mature on November 9, 2022. The Company provides an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee as to the payment of principal and interest on the 2012 Senior Notes.
Credit Facility
On September 29, 2015, the Company and OBH, as co-borrowers and co-guarantors, entered into a revolving credit facility administered by U.S. Bank N.A. and also including BMO Harris Bank N.A., which has a total commitment of $65.0 million and has a maturity date of September 29, 2019 (the Credit Facility). As of December 31, 2016, the Credit Facility was undrawn.
See Item 7—"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financing."
Corporate
Our corporate operations consist of the activities of the Company, and our intermediate subsidiaries which include OneBeacon U.S. Enterprises Holdings, Inc., OneBeacon U.S. Financial Services, Inc., and OBH, all U.S.-domiciled holding companies, as well as various other intermediate holding and financing companies domiciled in the United States, Barbados, Bermuda, Ireland and Luxembourg. The primary purpose of these entities is to efficiently manage the group's various capital and financing activities.

Regulatory Matters
General
Our insurance operations are subject to regulation and supervision in each of the United States jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and licensed to conduct business. Generally, state regulatory authorities have broad supervisory and administrative powers over such matters as licenses, standards of solvency, premium rates, policy forms, investments, statutory deposits, methods of accounting, form and content of the consolidated financial statements, reserves for unpaid loss and LAE, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements, dividends and other distributions to shareholders, annual and other report filings, and other market conduct. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders. We are also subject to Bermuda insurance regulations, which are generally similar to insurance regulations imposed by U.S. states on U.S.-domiciled insurers, though there are important differences, as described below.
State Accreditation and Monitoring
All states have laws establishing standards that an insurer must meet to maintain its license to write business. In addition, all states have enacted laws substantially similar to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) risk-based capital (RBC) standards for property and casualty companies, which are designed to determine minimum capital requirements and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations. The RBC formula for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk: underwriting, which encompasses the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing; declines in asset values arising from market and/or credit risk; and off-balance sheet risk arising from adverse experience from non-controlled assets, guarantees for affiliates or other contingent liabilities, and excessive premium growth. Under laws adopted by individual states, insurers having less total adjusted capital than that required by the RBC calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. 
The NAIC has a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special regulatory attention. Insurance companies generally submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data using prescribed financial data ratios (IRIS ratios), each with defined "usual ranges." Generally, regulators will begin to investigate or monitor an insurance company if its IRIS ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue or, in severe situations, assume control of the company. We currently believe that all of our insurance subsidiaries are within an acceptable IRIS range, and we are not aware of any IRIS-related regulatory investigation related to our insurance company subsidiaries.
Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer's ability to exit a market. For example, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of insurance business in the state without providing prior notice to or obtaining the state regulator's approval. State regulators may refuse to approve withdrawal plans on the grounds that they could lead to market disruption or for other reasons, including political and tax-related reasons. Some states also prohibit canceling or non-renewing certain policies for specific reasons.
State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, policyholder services, claims management and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.
Guaranty Funds and Mandatory Shared Market Mechanisms
As a condition of our license to do business in certain states, we are required to participate in guaranty funds in which licensed insurers within the state bear a portion of the loss suffered by claimants due to the insolvency of other insurers. Certain states also impose mandatory shared market mechanisms, such as assigned risk plans, with each state dictating the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided. Assigned risk plans require insurers licensed within the applicable state to accept applications for insurance policies from customers who are unable to obtain insurance in the voluntary market. The total number of such policies an insurer is required to accept is based on its market share of voluntary business in the state. Underwriting results related to assigned risk plans are typically adverse. Accordingly, we may be required to underwrite policies with a higher risk of loss than we would otherwise accept.
Reinsurance facilities are another type of shared market mechanism. Reinsurance facilities require an insurance company to accept all applications submitted by certain state designated agents. The reinsurance facility then allows the insurer to cede some of its business to the reinsurance facility and the facility will reimburse the insurer for claims paid on ceded business. Typically, however, reinsurance facilities operate at a deficit, which is funded through assessments against the same insurers. As a result, we could be required to underwrite policies with a higher risk of loss than we would otherwise voluntarily accept.
11

Pricing, Investment and Dividends
Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring property and casualty insurance companies to file their rates, rules and policy or coverage forms with the state's regulatory authority. In most cases, such rates, rules and forms must be approved prior to use. While pricing laws vary from state to state, their objectives are generally to ensure that rates are not excessive, unfairly discriminatory or used to engage in unfair price competition. Our ability to increase rates and the timing of the process are dependent upon the regulatory requirements in each state.
We are subject to state laws and regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and dictate the quality and kind of investments we may hold. Non-compliance may cause non-conforming investments to be non-admitted when measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, may require divestiture. Our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016 complied with such laws and regulations in all material respects.
One of the primary sources of cash inflows for us and certain of our intermediary holding companies is dividends or distributions received from our operating subsidiaries. Under the insurance laws of the domiciliary states of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, an insurer is restricted with respect to the timing or amount of dividends it may pay without prior approval by regulatory authorities. Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company (ASIC), a New York insurance company, is the lead insurance company for our specialty business. ASIC, regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services (NY DFS), has the ability to pay dividends to its immediate parent without the prior approval of regulatory authorities in an amount set by formula based on the lesser of (i) adjusted net investment income, as defined by statute, or (ii) 10% of statutory surplus, in both cases as most recently reported to regulatory authorities, subject to the availability of earned surplus. Additionally, upon ASIC’s request, the NY DFS has the discretion to approve a greater dividend, or allow for a special distribution of funds (including share repurchases). 
Split Rock Insurance, Ltd. (Split Rock) our Bermuda-based reinsurance company has the ability to distribute statutory capital without the prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, provided it does not reduce its total statutory capital, as shown in its previous financial year's statutory financial statements, by 15% or more. In addition, Split Rock has the ability to pay dividends to its immediate parent without the prior notification of regulatory authorities of up to 25% of its previous financial years total statutory capital and surplus, subject to meeting all appropriate liquidity and solvency requirements as specified in the Bermuda Insurance Act of 1978 and related regulations (Insurance Act) and the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (Companies Act). See Item 7A—"Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further information regarding dividend capacity for ASIC and Split Rock.
Holding Company Structure
We are subject to regulation under certain state insurance holding company acts. These regulations contain reporting requirements relating to our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations. These regulations also contain special reporting and prior approval requirements with respect to certain transactions among affiliates. Since we are an insurance holding company, the domiciliary states of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries impose regulatory application and approval requirements on acquisitions of common shares which may be deemed to confer control over those subsidiaries, as that concept is defined under the applicable state laws. Acquisition of as little as 10% of our common shares may be deemed to confer control under the insurance laws of some jurisdictions, and the application process for approval can be extensive and time consuming.
Legislation
Although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal legislation and administrative policies impact the industry. In addition, legislation has been introduced in recent years that, if enacted, could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in the regulation of the insurance industry. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) created the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Treasury Department, which is responsible for gathering information and monitoring the insurance industry to identify gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or U.S. financial system. In addition to these recent financial regulations, we are impacted by other federal regulations targeted at the insurance industry, such as the Terrorism Act, which established a federal "backstop" for commercial property and casualty losses (see "—Catastrophe Risk Management and Reinsurance Protection" above). For example, the generally applicable levels of reinsurance support that the federal government provides to authorized carriers under the Terrorism Act could be reduced by future legislation. We will continue to monitor new and changing federal regulations and their potential impact, if any, on our insurance company subsidiaries.
12

In addition to emerging federal regulation, many states are adopting laws that attempt to strengthen the ability of regulators to understand and regulate the risk management practices of insurers and insurance groups. For example, many states have adopted measures related to the NAIC’s Solvency Modernization Initiative (SMI), which have included model regulations that require insurers to summarize their key risks and risk management strategies to regulators. For example, the SMI resulted in a 2010 amendment to the NAIC’s Model Insurance Company Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the Model Holding Company Act), which requires the ultimate controlling person in an insurer’s holding company structure to identify and report material enterprise risks to the state insurance regulator. The SMI also produced the NAIC Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Model Act (ORSA), which requires insurers meeting premium thresholds to: 1) maintain a risk management framework; and 2) annually submit a comprehensive report designed to assess the adequacy of an insurer’s risk management practices, including risks related to the insurer’s future solvency position. ORSA requirements became effective in 2015 in all of the domiciliary states of our U.S. insurance company subsidiaries.
Bermuda Law
We are an exempted company organized under the Companies Act. As a result, we are required to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act regulating the payment of dividends and making of distributions from contributed surplus. A company is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend, or making a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that:

• | the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or


• | the realizable value of the company's assets would thereby be less than its liabilities.

Under our bye-laws, each common share is entitled to dividends if, and when, dividends are declared by our board of directors (the Board), subject to any preferred dividend rights of the holders of any preference shares. Issued share capital is the aggregate par value of the company's issued shares, and the share premium account is the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value. Share premium accounts may be reduced in certain limited circumstances. In addition, the Companies Act regulates return of capital, reduction of capital and any purchase or redemption of shares by OneBeacon.
Although we are incorporated in Bermuda, we have been designated as a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Pursuant to our non-resident status, we may hold any currency other than Bermuda dollars and convert that currency into any other currency, other than Bermuda dollars, without restriction.
Shares may be offered or sold in Bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the Investment Business Act 2003 and the Exchange Control Act 1972, and related regulations of Bermuda which regulate the sale of securities in Bermuda. In addition, specific permission is required from the BMA pursuant to the provisions of the Exchange Control Act 1972 and related regulations, for all issuances and transfers of securities of Bermuda companies, other than in cases where the BMA has granted a general permission. The BMA, in its policy dated June 1, 2005, provides that, where any equity securities, including our common shares, of a Bermuda company are listed on an appointed stock exchange, general permission is given for the issue and subsequent transfer of any securities of a company from and/or to a non-resident for as long as any equity securities of such company remain so listed. The New York Stock Exchange is deemed to be an appointed stock exchange under Bermuda law. Notwithstanding the above general permission, the BMA has granted us permission to, subject to our common shares being listed on an appointed stock exchange, (a) issue and transfer our shares, up to the amount of our authorized capital from time to time, to persons resident and non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes; (b) issue and transfer our options, warrants, depositary receipts, rights, and other securities; and (c) issue and transfer our loan notes and other debt instruments and options, warrants, receipts, rights over loan notes and other debt instruments to persons resident and non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes.
Under Bermuda law, exempted companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda from a principal place in Bermuda. As an exempted company, we may not, without the express authorization of the Bermuda legislature or under a license granted by the Bermuda Minister of Economic Development (Minister), participate in various specified business transactions, including:

• | the acquisition or holding of land in Bermuda, except land held by way of lease or tenancy agreement which is required for our business and held for a term not exceeding 50 years, or which is used to provide accommodation or recreational facilities for our officers and employees and held with the consent of the Minister, for a term not exceeding 21 years;


• | the taking of mortgages on land in Bermuda in excess of $50,000;


• | the acquisition of any bonds or debentures secured by any land in Bermuda, other than certain types of Bermuda government or public authority securities; or

13


• | subject to some exceptions, the carrying on of business of any kind in Bermuda for which we are not licensed in Bermuda.

Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians (other than spouses of Bermudians, holders of permanent resident certificates and holders of working resident certificates) may not engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit. Work permits may be granted or extended by the Bermuda government upon showing that, after proper public advertisement in most cases, no Bermudian (or spouse of a Bermudian or a holder of a permanent resident’s certificate or holder of a working resident’s certificate) is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position. A waiver from advertising is automatically granted in respect of any chief executive officer position and other chief officer positions.
The Company’s indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, Split Rock, is a Bermuda-based reinsurance company. Split Rock is subject to the Insurance Act. The Insurance Act requires Split Rock to be registered with the BMA. The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurance companies, including Split Rock, and grants the BMA powers to supervise, investigate, and intervene in the affairs of Bermuda insurance companies. While Bermuda insurance regulations are generally similar to insurance regulations imposed by U.S. states on U.S.-domiciled insurers, there are important differences. These differences must be accounted for in order for Split Rock to maintain its Bermuda insurance license. For example, instead of using the RBC formula to determine the minimum amount of capital needed to support an insurer’s overall business operations, under the Insurance Act, Split Rock is required to maintain available statutory capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of its enhanced capital requirement which is established by reference to either the BMA's Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR) model or an approved internal capital model in lieu thereof. Split Rock currently uses the BSCR model in calculating its capital and solvency requirements, which it files with the BMA annually along with its annual statutory return and which forms part of its overall capital and solvency return. Another difference relates to the regulation of insurer investments. Under the Insurance Act, Split Rock is required to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity in its investment portfolio. See the Pricing, Investing and Dividends section above for Bermuda restrictions with respect to distributions and dividends and Item 7A—"Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further information regarding dividend capacity for ASIC and Split Rock. Split Rock also submits audited GAAP financial statements and audited statutory financial statements to the BMA, the former of which are published on the BMA’s website. In addition, Split Rock files a financial condition report with the BMA, which is available from the Company for public inspection on request. Finally, in addition to compliance under the Insurance Act, Split Rock must also comply with provisions of the Companies Act relating to exempted companies, including with respect to payment of dividends, as set out above.
Ratings
Insurance companies are evaluated by various rating agencies in order to measure each company's financial strength. Higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims. We believe that strong ratings are an important factor in the marketing of insurance products and services to distribution partners and customers. These claims-paying (or financial strength) ratings do not refer to our ability to meet non-insurance obligations and are not a recommendation to purchase or discontinue any policy or contract issued by us or to buy, hold, or sell our securities.
The following table presents the financial strength ratings assigned to our principal insurance operating subsidiaries as of February 27, 2017:

 | A.M. Best(1) | Fitch(2) | Moody's(3) | Standard & Poor's(4)
Ratings | "A" (Excellent) | "A" (Strong) | "A3" (Good) | "A-" (Strong) 
Outlook | Stable | Stable | Stable | Stable 

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1) | "A" is the third highest of sixteen financial strength ratings assigned by A.M. Best.


(2) | "A" is the sixth highest of nineteen international financial strength ratings assigned by Fitch.


(3) | "A3" is the seventh highest of twenty-one financial strength ratings assigned by Moody's.


(4) | "A-" is the seventh highest of twenty-one financial strength ratings assigned by Standard & Poor's.
