Our History
 
Seen on Screen TV Inc. ("Company," "we," "us," or "Seen on Screen"), formerly Franklin Lake Resources Inc., a Nevada corporation, was an exploration stage mining company with no ore reserves or mining operations. Our activities up to October 31, 2008, had been limited to searching for material to extract precious minerals from and designing a process for profitable extraction.
 
On October 6, 2008, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Antoine Jarjour and Roula Jarjour, husband and wife, wherein we agreed to purchase certain assets from Mr. and Mrs. Jarjour in exchange for 17,000,000 post-reverse split shares of common stock.
 
On November 1, 2008, we changed our business activity from the mining business to selling products in our retail stores located throughout the United States.
 
On November 13, 2008, we amended our articles of incorporation and changed our name from Franklin Lake Resources Inc. to Seen on Screen TV Inc. We also amended our articles of incorporation to increase our authorized capital to 200,000,000 shares comprised of 195,000,000 shares of common and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each with a par value of $0.001 per share. On November 19, 2008, we amended the foregoing agreement to revise the list of assets to be acquired by us.
 
On January 10, 2010, we rescinded the asset purchase agreement we entered on October 6, 2008, as amended. Mr. and Mrs. Jarjour returned the 17,000,000 shares of common stock they received as consideration for the transaction. The transaction was rescinded as a result an inability to obtain an unqualified audit opinion after the conclusion of the transaction.
 
On April 6, 2010, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with Antoine Jarjour and Roula Jarjour, husband and wife, wherein we agreed to acquire all of the ownership units of Seen on Screen TV LLC, a Washington Limited Liability Corporation, in exchange for 17,000,000 restricted shares of common stock. The effective date of the Agreement was November 1, 2008.
 
On December 15, 2015, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement ("Memorandum") with Tony Reynolds DBA Reynolds Sports and Entertainment, now a wholly owned subsidiary of A Kickin Crowd LLC ("Reynolds") wherein we acquired an exclusive license to Buster's Backyard Bar-B-Q, alternatively Buster's Bar-B-Q, in exchange for $10,000 and 15,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock valued at $90,000.00.   The terms of the Memorandum provide that we retain all profits until we recoup net profits of $10,000.00.  After that, we retain 90% of net profits generated until we recoup $90,000.00.  After we recoup the foregoing $90,000.00, net profits are split 75% to us and 25% to Reynolds.
 
On January 2, 2016, we executed a License Agreement with Reynolds that embodied the terms of the Memorandum aforesaid.
 
On February 16, 2016, we issued 4,000,000 shares for VoiceFlix, Inc.  On November 5, 2015, we issued 6,000,000 shares to StockVest.  We issued 2,325,581 shares for Premier Venture Partners, LLC.

We are currently in development of a new website that is 80% completed and adding new products.
 
Our strategy is to create our on-line store, and our own in-house marketing production. We plan to produce products and have the products manufactured in China ourselves. These products will be sold on our website and to major retailers in the United States.
 
We are developing a strategic business model that adjusts to the rapid changes in the retail market.
 
In February 2015, we closed our retail store and now operate through an Internet website only as this is the most cost effective way for us to operate at this time.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe we have the right strategy capitalize on the opportunities afforded by our business model. We believe we will continue to have opportunities to drive growth through sales, expanding our operating profit.
Our Merchandise
 
Our products are generally personal and household use items that can be shipped via USPS or parcel delivery on normal schedules. We sell items that enhance convenience or lifestyle. We do not sell industrial products or food items. We do not sell perishable items of any sort. We have many products that are available on our website which can be accessed at http://www.sont.tv.
Our Customers
 
Our customers vary. Generally, we sell to the middle class and our customers tend to the 35-55 age bracket.
 
Our Suppliers
 
We purchase our merchandise from several sources, including the original marketing company. These are called "Patent Products." Patent Products are usually covered by various patents owned by the original inventor and/or marketing company. We, also, acquire similar products, i.e. generic products, from others who have created these generic products serving the same niche as the Patent Products. The generic products are significantly varied not to violate the rights of the Patent Products. Lastly, we source products that are generic. Our management has experience in sourcing these products. There are a limited number of manufacturers of this type of product. We believe our management has long-standing relations with the manufacturers, their representatives, and distributors, which will lead to sourcing of marketable products.
 
In addition, we source products from any of several "Product Shows" each year. At these Product Shows, we are able to meet directly with suppliers, representative and find cutting edge new products. Inventors and promoters frequent these shows with new products. We believe are may be able to acquire exclusive rights to products in this way.
 
Inventory in our stores varies on a regular basis. We believe we determine demand for a given products. In addition, some products may be in short supply if the market for a product is hot. If this occurs, we will reorder inventory quickly, if the product is backorder, we may miss the market. We are cognizant the product may only be popular for a few weeks. It is our goal to turn our inventories quickly to avoid carrying costs.
 
Return Policy
 
We have a 10-day exchange or return policy. Liquid products that are opened and used and personal hygiene products are not return or exchangeable.

Distribution, Transportation and Inventory Management
 
Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market value and is computed on a first-in first-out basis. For the year ended October 31, 2016, the company had no inventory.
Seasonality
 
Our business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, our highest sales volume occurs in the fourth quarter, which includes the Christmas selling season, and the lowest occurs in the first quarter. In addition, our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of certain holidays. In addition, we carry merchandise during our fourth quarter that we do not carry during the rest of the year, such as gift sets, holiday decorations, certain baking items, and a broader assortment of toys and candy.
Our Competition
 
We operate in the basic discount consumer goods market, which is highly competitive with respect to price, store location, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation, in-stock consistency, and customer service. We compete with discount stores and with many other retailers, Walgreens, Rite-Aids, and local general drug stores. In some cases our competition comes from big box stores, such as Wal-Mart, or Bed Bath and Beyond, among others. These retailers may carry a specific product at its peak, however they quickly discontinue and dump inventory. Almost all of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do.
 
We differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient, small-store format. We believe that our prices are competitive due in part to our low cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered.
 
Our Employees
 
As of February 13, 2017, we employed 1 part-time and 3 full-time employees.  We currently are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
