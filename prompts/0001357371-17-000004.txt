Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are an independent oil and gas partnership focused on the exploitation and development of oil, NGL and natural gas properties in the United States. Our assets consist primarily of producing and non-producing oil, NGL and natural gas reserves located in seven producing areas:

• | Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico;


• | Midwest (Michigan, Indiana and Kentucky);


• | Ark-La-Tex (Arkansas, Louisiana and East Texas);


• | Mid-Continent (Oklahoma);


• | Rockies (Wyoming and Colorado);


• | California; and


• | Southeast (Florida and Alabama).

Our assets are characterized by stable, long-lived production and proved reserve life indexes averaging greater than 12 years. As of December 31, 2016, our total estimated proved reserves were 205.3 MMBoe, of which approximately 55% was oil, 9% was NGLs and 36% was natural gas. Our production in 2016 was 18,279 MBoe, of which approximately 52% was oil, 11% was NGLs and 37% was natural gas.
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in 2006. Our general partner is Breitburn GP, a Delaware limited liability company and our wholly-owned subsidiary, and the board of directors of our General Partner (the “Board”) has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. We conduct our operations through a wholly-owned subsidiary, BOLP, BOLP’s general partner, BOGP, and through BOLP’s operating subsidiaries. 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Breitburn Management, operates our assets and performs other administrative services for us such as accounting, corporate development, finance, land administration, legal and engineering. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in this report for more information regarding our relationship with Breitburn Management.
Structure
The following diagram depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2016:
As of December 31, 2016 and March 7, 2017, we had approximately 213.8 million common units outstanding representing limited partner interests in us (“Common Units”). As of December 31, 2016 and March 7, 2017, we had 8.0 million 8.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (“Series A Preferred Units”) outstanding. As of December 31, 2016 and March 7, 2017, we had 49.6 million 8.0% Series B Perpetual Convertible Preferred Units (“Series B Preferred Units”) outstanding.

Chapter 11 Cases
On May 15, 2016 (the “Chapter 11 Filing Date”), the Partnership and certain of its affiliates (the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the “Chapter 11 Petitions” and the cases commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Chapter 11 Cases are being administered jointly under the caption “In re Breitburn Energy Partners LP, et al.”, Case No. 16-11390. The Debtors include the Partnership, Breitburn Management, BOGP, BOLP, Breitburn Finance, Breitburn GP, Breitburn Sawtelle LLC, Breitburn Oklahoma LLC, Phoenix Production Company, QR Energy, LP, QRE GP, LLC, QRE Operating, LLC, Breitburn Transpetco LP LLC, Breitburn Transpetco GP LLC, Transpetco Pipeline Company, L.P., Terra Energy Company LLC, Terra Pipeline Company LLC, Breitburn Florida LLC, Mercury Michigan Company, LLC, Beaver Creek Pipeline, L.L.C., GTG Pipeline LLC and Alamitos Company. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this report for more information regarding the Chapter 11 Cases. No trustee has been appointed and we continue to manage the Partnership and our affiliates and operate our businesses as “debtors in possession” subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. To assure ordinary course operations, we received approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of “first day” motions, including motions that authorize us to maintain our existing cash management system, to secure debtor-in-possession financing and other customary relief. In August 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered a final order approving the Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement, dated as of May 19, 2016, by and among BOLP, as borrower, the Partnership, as parent guarantor, the financial institutions from time to time party thereto (the “DIP Lenders”) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, swing line lender and issuing lender (the “DIP Credit Agreement”). In December 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving an extension of the DIP Credit Agreement to June 30, 2017.
The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases resulted in the acceleration of the Debtors’ obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 19, 2014, by and among BOLP, as borrower, the Partnership, as parent guarantor, the financial institutions from time to time party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, swing line lender and issuing lender (as amended, the “RBL Credit Agreement”) and the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes (each, as defined below). Any efforts to enforce such obligations are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions and the holders’ rights of enforcement in respect of these obligations are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. We are making adequate protection payments with respect to the lenders under the RBL Credit Agreement consisting of the payment of interest (at the default rate) and the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses of professionals retained by our lenders, as provided for in the RBL Credit Agreement. We are also making adequate protection payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes in the form of the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses of professionals retained by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. 
The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default under our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, resulting in a termination right by our counterparties. All of our counterparties exercised this termination right during the year ended December 31, 2016. The termination of these transactions has since exposed our cash flows to fluctuations in commodity prices. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in this report for a discussion of the terminated derivative instruments.
We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the reorganization in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. These costs are being expensed as incurred, and are expected to significantly affect our results. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this report for additional details. 
Effect of Filing on Creditors and Unitholders
On April 14, 2016, we elected to suspend the declaration of any further distributions on our Series A Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units. In addition, we elected to defer a $33.5 million interest payment due with respect to our 7.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Senior Notes”) and a $13.2 million interest payment due with respect to our 8.625% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Senior Notes” and together with the 2022 Senior Notes, the “Senior Unsecured Notes”), with each such interest payment due on April 15, 2016 and subject to a 30-day grace period. As a consequence of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, such interest payments have not been made.
Under the priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree otherwise, pre-petition liabilities and post-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full before the holders of our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units are entitled to receive any distribution or retain any property under a plan of reorganization. The ultimate recovery to creditors and/or unitholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation and implementation of a 
7

plan of reorganization. No assurance can be given as to what distributions, if any, will be made to each of these constituencies or the nature thereof. If certain requirements of the Bankruptcy Code are met, a plan of reorganization can be confirmed notwithstanding its rejection or deemed rejection by the holders of our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units and notwithstanding the fact that such holders do not receive or retain any property on account of their equity interests under the plan. Because of such possibilities, the value of our securities, including our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units, is highly speculative. There can be no assurance that the holders of our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units will retain any value under a plan of reorganization. We believe it is highly likely that our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units will be canceled in our Chapter 11 Cases and that the holders thereof will not receive any distribution on account of their holdings. 
Executory Contracts. Subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. The rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is generally treated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired
lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under such executory
contract or unexpired lease, but may give rise to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed
breach. The assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease generally requires the Debtors to cure existing monetary
defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease and provide adequate assurance of future performance. By order of the Bankruptcy Court dated December 12, 2016, the Debtors assumed all of their executory contracts and unexpired leases related to their oil and gas operations to the extent such contracts and leases constituted commercial property leases under the purview of the Bankruptcy Code.
Process for Plan of Reorganization. In order to successfully emerge from Chapter 11, the Debtors will need to obtain confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court of a plan of reorganization that satisfies the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization generally provides for how pre-petition obligations and equity interests will be treated in satisfaction and discharge thereof, and provides for the means by which the plan of reorganization will be implemented. 
Fresh Start Accounting. We may be required to adopt fresh start accounting upon emergence from Chapter 11. Adopting fresh start accounting would result in the allocation of the reorganization value to individual assets based on their estimated fair values. The enterprise value of the equity of the emerging company is based on several assumptions and inputs contemplated in the future projections of the plan of reorganization and are subject to significant uncertainties. We currently cannot estimate the potential financial effect of fresh start accounting on our consolidated financial statements upon the emergence from Chapter 11, although we would expect to recognize material adjustments upon implementation of fresh start accounting guidance upon emergence pursuant to a plan of reorganization. The assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of material impact affecting the reorganization value include management’s assumptions and capital expenditure plans related to the estimation of our oil and gas reserves.

Long-Term Business Strategy
Our long-term goals have been to manage our current and future oil, NGL and natural gas producing properties for the purpose of generating cash flow. Prior to the decline in commodity prices and the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions, our core investment strategy included the following principles:

• | acquire long-lived assets with low-risk exploitation and development opportunities;


• | use our technical expertise and state-of-the-art technologies to identify and implement successful exploitation techniques to optimize reserve recovery;


• | reduce cash flow volatility through commodity price and interest rate derivatives; and

8


• | maximize asset value and cash flow stability through our operating and technical expertise.

In response to the steep and continued decline in commodity prices during 2014, 2015 and the first part of 2016, we adjusted our business strategies by suspending distributions to common and preferred unitholders, significantly reducing our capital budget, cutting operating and overhead costs, scaling back derivative activity and reducing our acquisition expectations. Sustained low commodity prices led to the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions, as described above.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
2016 Disposition
In March 2016, we completed the sale of certain of our Mid-Continent assets (the “Mid-Continent Sale”) for net proceeds of $11.9 million. The sale included substantially all Mid-Continent properties acquired in our merger with QR Energy, LP (“QRE”) in 2014, excluding five wells for which we have asset retirement obligations and over-riding royalty interests and royalty interests in an additional 42 wells. This transaction was effective as of January 1, 2016. We recognized a gain of $11.3 million from the Mid-Continent Sale.
2015 Acquisitions
CO2 Acquisition. On March 31, 2015, we completed the acquisition of certain CO2 producing properties located in Harding County, New Mexico, for a total purchase price of $70.5 million (the “CO2 Acquisition”), which is primarily reflected in other property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this report for a discussion of the CO2 Acquisition.
2014 Acquisitions
Antares Acquisition. On October 24, 2014, we completed the acquisition of certain oil and gas properties located in the Midland Basin, Texas from Antares Energy Company, in exchange for 4.3 million Common Units and $50.0 million in cash, for a total purchase price of $122.3 million (the “Antares Acquisition”). 
QRE Merger.     On November 19, 2014, we acquired QRE in exchange for approximately 71.5 million Common Units and $350 million in cash (the “QRE Merger”). The QRE Merger had a transaction value of approximately $2.5 billion, including approximately $1.1 billion of QRE debt assumed and net of approximately $5.1 million of cash acquired. Our consolidated financial statements and financial and operational results reflect the combined entities since the acquisition date. The properties acquired in the QRE Merger were located in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.
Properties
Our properties include oil, NGL and natural gas assets as well as midstream assets located in the following producing areas: (i) Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, (ii) Midwest (Michigan, Indiana, and Kentucky), (iii) Ark-La-Tex (Arkansas, Louisiana and East Texas), (iv) Mid-Continent (Oklahoma), (v) the Rockies (Wyoming and Colorado), (vi) California and (vii) Southeast (Florida and Alabama). Our midstream assets include transmission and gathering pipelines, gas processing plants, NGL recovery plants, a controlling interest in a salt water disposal company and the 120-mile Transpetco Pipeline. 
Breitburn Management manages all of our properties and employs production and reservoir engineers, geologists and other specialists, as well as field personnel. On a net production basis, we operated approximately 89% of our total production in 2016. As the operator, we design and manage the development of wells and supervise operation and maintenance activities on a day-to-day basis. We do not own drilling rigs or other oil field services equipment used for drilling or maintaining wells on properties we operate. We engage independent contractors to provide all the equipment and personnel associated with these activities.
2017 Outlook
In 2016, oil and natural gas prices continued to remain low and volatile. In 2016, the monthly average WTI posted price ranged from a low of $30 per Bbl in February to a high of $52 per Bbl in December, and the monthly average Henry Hub posted price ranged from a low of $1.73 per MMBtu in March to a high of $3.59 MMBtu in December. Declines in commodity prices that began at the end of 2014 led us to file for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, as described above. We 
9

have been managing, and plan to continue to evaluate, our operating activities and liquidity carefully in light of the uncertainty regarding future oil and natural gas prices and the Chapter 11 Cases. We do not expect increased production as a result of our 2017 capital program to entirely offset production declines; we expect overall decreases to our production in 2017, without taking into account acquisitions, divestitures or further modifications to our capital and operating plan based on price changes through 2017.
We expect our full year 2017 oil and gas capital spending program to be approximately $100 million, including capitalized engineering costs, compared with approximately $65 million in 2016, approximately $209 million in 2015 and approximately $389 in 2014. The increase in capital expenditures primarily reflects higher CO2 purchases for our Postle field in Mid-Continent to counteract production declines and our continued development in Ark-La-Tex and the Permian Basin. We anticipate that 60% of our total capital spending will be focused on drilling and rate-generating projects and CO2 purchases in our core operating areas of Ark-La-Tex, the Permian Basin and Mid-Continent that are designed to increase or add to production or reserves. We plan to drill 20 operated and non-operated wells primarily in Ark-La-Tex and the Permian Basin. 
Reserves and Production
As of December 31, 2016, our total estimated proved reserves were 205.3 MMBoe, of which approximately 55% was oil, 9% was NGLs and 36% was natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, our total estimated proved reserves were 239.3 MMBoe, of which approximately 54% was oil, 8% was NGLs and 38% was natural gas. The change to our total estimated proved reserves from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 was a net decrease of 34.0 MMBoe, and included negative reserve revisions of 34.4 MMBoe, 18.3 MMBoe of production and a 2.0 MMBoe sale of reserves-in-place, partially offset by 20.6 MMBoe in extensions and discoveries. The reserve revisions in 2016 were primarily the result of a 22.0 MMBbl decrease in oil reserves and a 1.4 MMBbl decrease in NGL reserves, driven primarily by a decrease in oil and NGL prices, and a 66.3 Bcf decrease in natural gas reserves, driven primarily by a decrease in natural gas prices. The unweighted average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices used to determine our total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 were $42.75 per Bbl of oil for the WTI spot price and $2.48 per MMBtu of natural gas for the Henry Hub spot price, compared to $50.28 per Bbl of oil for the WTI spot price and $2.59 per MMBtu of natural gas for the Henry Hub spot price in 2015.
The following table summarizes our estimated proved reserves and production by producing area as of December 31, 2016:

(a) Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one Bbl of oil equivalent. This ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency. Given commodity price disparities, the price for a Bbl of oil equivalent for natural gas is significantly less than the price for a Bbl of oil.
(b) As of December 31, 2016, the Antrim Shale, included in “Midwest” above, and Spraberry Trend, included in “Permian Basin” above, were the only fields which contained 15% or more of our total proved reserves.

See “Results of Operations” in Part II—Item 7 of this report for average realized sales price and average production cost per Boe for the Partnership in total.
As of December 31, 2016, proved undeveloped reserves were 53.3 MMBoe compared to 47.3 MMBoe as of December 31, 2015. During 2016, we incurred $16.8 million in capital expenditures and drilled seven net wells related to the conversion of estimated proved undeveloped reserves to estimated proved developed reserves. During 2016, we converted 580.0 MBbl of oil, 654.0 MBbl of NGLs and 13.8 Bcf of natural gas from estimated proved undeveloped reserves to estimated proved developed reserves. As of December 31, 2016, we had no estimated proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for more than five years, and we expect to develop substantially all estimated proved undeveloped reserves within five years of the recognition of those reserves.
As of December 31, 2016, the total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $803.7 million. During 2016, we filed estimates of oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2015 with the U.S. Department of Energy, which were consistent with the reserve data as of December 31, 2015 as reported in Note A in the supplemental information to the consolidated financial statements in this report.
Uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors that are beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and its interpretation. As a result, estimates by different engineers often vary, sometimes significantly. In addition, physical factors such as the results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate, as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices or development costs and production expenses, may require revision of such estimates. Accordingly, oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered will vary from reserve estimates. See Part I—Item 1A “—Risk Factors” in this report for a description of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and reserves.
The information in this report relating to our estimated proved oil and gas reserves is based upon reserve reports prepared as of December 31, 2016. Estimates of our proved reserves were prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”) and Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“CGA”), independent petroleum engineering firms. NSAI prepared reserve data for all our properties except for our Postle and North East Hardesty fields in Oklahoma, which was prepared by CGA. The reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by members of our senior engineering staff and management. The process performed by NSAI and CGA to prepare reserve amounts included their estimation of reserve quantities, future producing rates, future net revenue and the present value of such future net revenue. NSAI and CGA also prepared estimates with respect to reserve categorization, using the definitions for proved reserves set forth in Rule 4-10(a)(22) of Regulation S-X and subsequent SEC staff interpretations and guidance. In the conduct of their preparation of the reserve estimates, NSAI and CGA did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. However, if in the course of their work, something came to their attention that brought into question the validity 
11

or sufficiency of any such information or data, they did not rely on such information or data until they had satisfactorily resolved their questions relating thereto.
The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing preparation of the reserves estimates and the third party reserve reports is Mark L. Pease, the President and Chief Operating Officer of our General Partner. Mr. Pease received a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines in 1979. Prior to joining our General Partner, Mr. Pease was Senior Vice President, E&P Technology & Services for Anadarko Petroleum Corporation.  Mr. Pease has over 30 years of experience working in various capacities in the energy industry, including acquisition analysis, reserve estimation, reservoir engineering and operations engineering. Mr. Pease consults with NSAI and CGA during the reserve estimation process to review properties, assumptions and relevant data. 
See Exhibit 99.1 to this report for the estimates of proved reserves provided by NSAI and Exhibit 99.2 to this report for the estimates of proved reserves provided by CGA. We only employ large, widely known, highly regarded and reputable engineering consulting firms. Not only the firms, but the technical persons that sign and seal the reports are licensed and certify that they meet all professional requirements. Licensing requirements formally require mandatory continuing education and professional qualifications. See Supplemental Note A to the consolidated financial statements in this report for further details about the qualifications of the technical persons at NSAI and CGA primarily responsible for preparing the reserves estimates.
Properties 

Permian Basin
 Our Permian Basin properties are primarily located in the southern Midland Basin and Eastern Shelf in Texas and New Mexico. As of December 31, 2016, estimated proved reserves attributable to our Permian Basin properties were 46.2 MMBoe, or approximately 22% of our total estimated proved reserves. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 65% of our Permian Basin total estimated proved reserves were oil, 18% were NGLs, and 17% were natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our average production from the Permian Basin was approximately 10.6 MBoe/d. In 2016, we drilled 15 gross new productive development wells, one recompletion, and completed six workovers in the Permian Basin. Our capital spending in the Permian Basin for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $14 million. In total, as of December 31, 2016, we had interests in 3,186 productive wells in the Permian Basin, and we operated approximately 44% of those wells.
Midwest (Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky)
As of December 31, 2016, our estimated proved reserves attributable to our Midwest properties were 41.1 MMBoe, or approximately 20% of our total estimated proved reserves. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 90% of our Midwest total estimated proved reserves were natural gas, 8% were oil and 2% were NGLs . For the year ended December 31, 2016, our average production from our Midwest properties was approximately 7.9 MBoe/d or 47.7 MMcfe/d. Our integrated midstream assets enhance the value of our Midwest properties as gas is sold at MichCon City-Gate prices, and we have no significant reliance on third party transportation. In 2016, we drilled one gross new productive development well and completed one workover in the Midwest. Our capital spending in the Midwest for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $3 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had interests in 3,729 productive wells in the Midwest, and we operated approximately 50% of those wells.
The Antrim Shale underlies a large percentage of our Midwest acreage; wells tend to produce relatively predictable amounts of natural gas in this reservoir. On average, our Antrim Shale wells have an estimated proved reserve life of greater than 16 years. Since reserve quantities and production levels over a large number of wells are fairly predictable, maximizing per well recoveries and minimizing per unit production costs are the keys to profitable Antrim Shale development. Growth opportunities include infill drilling and recompletions, horizontal drilling and bolt-on acquisitions. 
Our non-Antrim interests in Michigan are located in several reservoirs including the Prairie du Chien, Richfield, Detroit River Zone III and Niagaran pinnacle reefs. Our operations in the New Albany Shale of southern Indiana and northern Kentucky include 21 miles of high pressure gas pipeline that interconnects with the Texas Gas Transmission interstate pipeline.

Ark-La-Tex
The Ark-La-Tex area includes properties located in southern Arkansas, northern Louisiana and eastern Texas. These properties produce from formations including the Cotton Valley Sand, Haynesville Sand, Woodbine Sand and Smackover Carbonate.
As of December 31, 2016, estimated proved reserves attributable to our Ark-La-Tex properties were 34.4 MMBbls, or approximately 17% of our total estimated proved reserves. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 46% of our Ark-La-Tex total estimated proved reserves were oil, 12% were NGLs, and 42% were natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our average production was approximately 10.7 MBoe/d. Our capital spending in Ark-La-Tex for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $19 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had interests in 3,043 productive wells in Ark-La-Tex, and we operated 97% of those wells. During 2016, we drilled nine gross wells, three recompletions and completed 29 workovers.

Mid-Continent
Our Mid-Continent area includes properties located in western Oklahoma and CO2 operations in northeastern New Mexico. These properties produce from regionally significant geologic formations such as the Council Grove, Morrow, Cherokee and Tubb. As of December 31, 2016, estimated proved reserves attributable to our Mid-Continent properties were 30.4 MMBoe, or approximately 15% of our total estimated proved reserves. Approximately 82% of our Mid-Continent total estimated proved reserves were oil, 16% were NGLs and 2% were natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the average production from our Mid-Continent properties were approximately 5.9 MBoe/d. In 2016, we completed three workovers in the Mid-Continent. Our capital spending in the Mid-Continent for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $15 million, primarily attributable to CO2 purchases. In total, as of December 31, 2016, we had interests in 357 productive wells, and we operated approximately 100% of those wells.
The most significant of our Mid-Continent properties are the Postle Field and the Northeast Hardesty Unit, both of which are located in Texas County, Oklahoma. CO2 miscible flooding has been on-going in the Postle Field since 1995. CO2 for the projects is sourced from the Bravo Dome Field in eastern New Mexico. We are also the sole owner of the Dry Trails gas plant located at the Postle Field complex. This plant is comprised of two trains with a combined processing capacity of approximately 100 MMcf/d. Gas is processed to recover marketable hydrocarbon components from the wellhead stream and capture CO2 gas for recompression and reuse in the flooding process. In addition, we are the sole owner of a collection of facilities and CO2 transportation pipelines delivering product from New Mexico to the Postle and Northeast Hardesty fields.

Rockies
Our Rockies assets consist primarily of oil properties in the Powder River Basin in eastern Wyoming and Wind River and Big Horn Basins in central Wyoming and natural gas properties in the Evanston and Green River Basins in southwestern Wyoming. We also own non-operated producing assets in Weld County, Colorado. 

As of December 31, 2016, estimated proved reserves attributable to our properties in the Rockies were 24.2 MMBoe, or approximately 12% of our total estimated proved reserves. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 46% of our Wyoming total estimated proved reserves were oil and 54% were natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our average production from our fields in Wyoming and Colorado were approximately 5.9 MBoe/d. In 2016, we completed six workovers in Wyoming. Our capital spending in Wyoming for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $1 million. In total, as of December 31, 2016, we had interests in 976 productive wells in Wyoming, and we operated approximately 66% of those wells. Our non-operated assets in Colorado consist of 18 productive wells.
California
As of December 31, 2016, estimated proved reserves attributable to our California properties were 15.5 MMBoe, or approximately 7% of our total estimated proved reserves. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 97% of our California total estimated proved reserves were oil and 3% were natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our average California production was approximately 4.1 MBoe/d. In 2016, we drilled 13 recompletions in California. Our capital spending in California for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $8 million. In total, as of December 31, 2016, we had interests in 567 productive wells in California, and we operated 100% of those wells.
13

Our operations in California are concentrated in several large, complex oil fields within the Los Angeles Basin. We also operate oil properties in the San Joaquin Basin in Kern County, California.
Southeast
Our Southeast producing area is comprised of significant holdings in two major geologic trends, the Sunniland trend in southwest Florida and the Jay trend in the northwest Florida Panhandle. These properties produce from the Cretaceous formations of the South Florida Basin and the Smackover Carbonate formation, respectively. 
Our assets in the Southeast are characterized by large hydrocarbon resources in place. The Jay/Little Escambia Creek Unit (“Jay Unit”), which straddles the Alabama/Florida state lines, has been under nitrogen miscible gas injection since 1980. We operate a 70 acre processing and handling facility within the Jay Unit that separates oil, marketable hydrocarbon components and sulfur from the produced fluid stream. The remaining nitrogen rich gas is recompressed and reused in the flood process. Additional volumes of injected nitrogen are sourced from two operated air separation units located in Flomaton, Alabama in the north area of the field.
As of December 31, 2016, estimated proved reserves attributable to our assets in the Southeast were 13.5 MMBoe, or approximately 7% of our total estimated proved reserves. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 91% of our Southeast total estimated proved reserves were oil, 8% were NGLs, and 1% were natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our average Southeast production was approximately 4.8 MBoe/d. In 2016, we completed eight workovers in the Southeast. Our capital spending for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $5 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had interests in 92 productive wells in the Southeast, and we operated 96% of those wells.
Productive Wells
The following table sets forth information for our properties as of December 31, 2016, relating to the productive wells in which we owned a working interest. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production. Gross wells are the total number of productive wells in which we have an interest, and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in the gross wells. We had approximately 44 wells with multiple completions as of December 31, 2016. 

 | Oil Wells | Gas Wells
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net 
Operated | 5,088 | | 4,913 | | 2,807 | 2,298

Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
The following table sets forth information for our properties as of December 31, 2016 relating to our leasehold acreage. Developed acres are acres spaced or assigned to productive wells. Undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of gas or oil, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Gross acres are the total number of acres in which a working interest is owned. Net acres are the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.

As of December 31, 2016, we held more than 110,000 net acres in the developing Utica-Collingwood shale play in Michigan, all of which was held by production and is included in the developed acreage in the above table. 
Drilling Activity
Drilling activity and production optimization projects are on lower risk, development properties. The following table sets forth information for our properties with respect to wells completed during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return. No exploratory wells were drilled during the periods presented.

 As of December 31, 2016, we had the following wells in progress: one gross well and less than one net well in the Midwest and two gross wells and one net well in Ark-La-Tex. As of December 31, 2016, we had a CO2 injection pressure maintenance project in process in Michigan, and a waterflood expansion project in process in Wyoming.
Delivery Commitments
As of December 31, 2016, we had a contractual commitment to deliver 14.7 MMBoe of oil to a pipeline in West Texas through September 30, 2024. We expect to fulfill this commitment with existing Permian Basin estimated proved reserves.
Sales Contracts
We have a portfolio of oil, NGL and natural gas sales contracts with large, established refiners and utilities. Our sales contracts are sold at market-sensitive or spot prices. Because commodity products are sold primarily on the basis of price and availability, we are not dependent upon one purchaser or a small group of purchasers. During 2016, our largest purchasers were Shell Trading (US) Company (“Shell Trading”), which accounted for approximately 17% of our net sales revenues, and Plains Marketing (“Plains Marketing”), which accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales revenues. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this report for a discussion of significant customers for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Commodity Prices
We analyze the prices we realize from the sales of all our produced products, including crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, and the impact on those prices of differences in market-based index prices. We market our oil and natural gas production to a variety of purchasers based upon the NYMEX posted prices for WTI and Natural Gas, as well as on the geographic regional U.S. posted prices for all products. The NYMEX WTI posted price of oil is the widely used benchmark in the pricing of domestic oil in the United States. The relative value of crude oil is mainly determined by its quality and geographic location. In the case of NYMEX WTI posted pricing, this oil is light and sweet, deemed 40 degrees API, and is priced for delivery at Cushing, Oklahoma. In general, produced products with fewer transportation requirements result in higher realized pricing for producers. Historically there has been a strong relationship between changes in NGL and crude oil prices. NGL prices are correlated to North American supply and petrochemical demands.
Our Permian Basin oil trades at a discount to WTI posted prices due to the deduction of transportation costs, and our Permian Basin NGLs trade at a discount due to processing fees, profit sharing and transportation. Our Mid-Continent oil trades at a discount to WTI posted prices primarily due to transportation and quality, and our Mid-Continent NGLs trade at a discount due to regional market demand and transportation. Our Rockies oil trades at a significant discount to WTI posted prices because of its distance from a major refining market and the fact that our central Wyoming production is priced relative to the Western Canadian Select benchmark. Our Southwestern Wyoming production is priced relative to Flint Hills Resources Wyoming Sweet posted prices. Our Ark-La-Tex oil trades at a premium to WTI posted prices due to local refinery market supply. Our oil from the Sunniland Trend in Florida trades at a discount to WTI posted prices primarily because it is heavy crude and is transported via barge to market. Our oil from the Jay Field in Florida also trades at a discount to WTI posted price due to transportation costs and quality. Our California oil is generally in proximity to the extensive Los Angeles refining market and trades in accordance with that local market, which competes with waterborne crude imports.
In 2016, the WTI posted price averaged approximately $43 per Bbl, compared with $48 a year earlier. The monthly average WTI posted prices during 2016 ranged from a high of $52 per Bbl in December to a low of $30 per Bbl in February. As of February 28, 2017, the WTI spot price during 2017 has averaged $53 per Bbl.
Our Midwest properties have favorable natural gas supply and demand characteristics due to their proximity to the Northeast, allowing us to sell our natural gas production at a slight premium to posted prices. Our Rockies area natural gas generally trades at a discount to NYMEX due to its location and the regional supply and demand market balances. Prices for natural gas have historically fluctuated widely, and many regional markets are aligned with the local supply and demand conditions in those regional markets rather than with the overall U.S. market. Fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the United States are closely associated with the volumes produced in North America and the inventory in underground storage relative to customer demand. U.S. natural gas prices are also typically higher during the winter period when demand for heating is greatest. During 2016, the monthly average Henry Hub posted price ranged from a high of $3.59 per MMBtu in December to a low of $1.73 per MMBtu in March. During 2016, the Henry Hub posted price averaged approximately $2.51 per MMBtu. As of February 28, 2017, the Henry Hub posted price during 2017 has averaged $3.10 per MMBtu. 
 Our operating expenses are responsive to changes in commodity prices. We experience pressure on operating expenses that is highly correlated to oil prices for specific expenditures such as lease fuel, electricity, drilling services and severance and minerals-based property taxes. Sustained depressed prices of oil and natural gas will adversely affect our assets, development plans, results of operations and financial position, perhaps materially. See Part I—Item 1A “—Risk Factors” — “Risks Related to Our Business — Oil, NGL and natural gas prices and differentials are highly volatile. Declines in commodity prices, especially steep declines in the price of oil, have adversely affected, and in the future will adversely affect, our financial condition and results of operations, cash flow, access to the capital markets and ability to grow. ”
Derivative Activity
Our revenues and net income are highly sensitive to oil and natural gas prices. In the past, we entered into various derivative contracts intended to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas. As discussed above, the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default under our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, resulting in a termination right by our counterparties. All of our counterparties exercised this right during the year ended December 31, 2016, and, as a result, we had no active commodity derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2016. For a more detailed discussion of our derivative activities, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
16

Competition
The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in all aspects of our business, including acquiring properties and oil and gas leases, marketing oil and gas, contracting for drilling rigs and other equipment necessary for drilling and completing wells and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staffs substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit.
In regards to the competition we face for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment, the oil and gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel in the past, which have delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and have caused significant price increases. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation program. Competition is also strong for attractive oil and gas producing properties, undeveloped leases and drilling rights, which may affect our ability to compete satisfactorily when attempting to make further acquisitions. See Item 1A “—Risk Factors” — “Risks Related to Our Business — We may be unable to compete effectively with other companies in the oil and gas industry, which may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue” in this report.
Title to Properties
As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, we believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry. We have granted the lenders under the RBL Credit Agreement a first lien on substantially all of our oil and gas properties. We have granted the holders of our 9.25% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2020 (the “Senior Secured Notes” and together with the Senior Unsecured Notes, the “Senior Notes”) a second lien on substantially all of our oil and gas properties. We have also granted the lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement a superpriority lien on substantially all of our oil and gas properties. Our properties are also subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens, which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties.
Some of our oil and gas leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, licenses and franchise ordinances require the consent of the current landowner to transfer these rights, which in some instances is a governmental entity. We believe that we have obtained sufficient third party consents, permits and authorizations for us to operate our business in all material respects. With respect to any consents, permits or authorizations that have not been obtained, we believe that the failure to obtain these consents, permits or authorizations have no material adverse effect on the operation of our business.
Seasonal Nature of Business
Seasonal weather conditions, especially freezing conditions in Michigan and Wyoming and tropical storms and hurricanes in the Gulf Coast, and lease stipulations can limit our drilling activities and other operations in certain of the areas in which we operate, and, as a result, we seek to perform the majority of our drilling during the non-winter months. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay our operations.
17

Environmental Matters and Regulation
General. Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the emission and discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:

• | require the acquisition of various permits before exploration, drilling or production activities commence;


• | prohibit some or all of the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with regulatory requirements;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities;


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and


• | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits, plug abandoned wells and restore drilling sites.

These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, the United States Congress (“Congress”), state legislatures and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which our business operations are subject.
Waste Handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has delegated authority to the individual states to administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exemption certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Also, in the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics.
Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Despite the “petroleum exclusion” of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses oil and natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances subject to CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be held jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
18

We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. From time to time, we have discovered evidence that petroleum spills or releases have occurred in the past at some of the properties owned or leased by us. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.
Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In September 2015, new EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rules defining the scope of the EPA’s and the Corps’ jurisdiction became effective. To the extent the rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of Clean Water Act programs, and implementation of the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge. Litigation surrounding the rule is ongoing. The Clean Water Act also imposes spill prevention, control, and countermeasure requirements, including requirements for appropriate containment berms and similar structures, to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture, or leak. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”), which establishes a variety of requirements pertaining to oil spill prevention, containment, and cleanup. OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties, including owners and operators of onshore facilities, are required to develop and implement plans for preventing and responding to oil spills and, if a spill occurs, may be subject to oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from the spill. Effective as of September 2015, comparable California regulations require spill contingency plans for inland oil and gas facilities. 
Underground Injection Control (“UIC”). The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and comparable state laws regulate the construction, operation, permitting and closure of injection wells that place fluids underground for storage or disposal. Under the SDWA’s UIC Program, producers must obtain federal or state Class II injection well permits and routinely monitor and report fluid volumes, pressures and chemistry, and conduct mechanical integrity tests on injection wells. While the EPA itself implements the UIC Program for Class II wells (which are used to inject brines and other fluids associated with oil and gas production) in some of the states in which we operate, other states in which we operate, such as California, Oklahoma and Texas, have primary enforcement authority with respect to the regulation of Class II wells. In response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related wastewater, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of certain injection wells. As a result of these concerns, regulators in some states are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission (“RRC”) in October 2014 adopted new oil and gas permit rules for wells used to dispose of saltwater and other fluids resulting from the production of oil and natural gas in order to address seismic activity concerns. Among other things, the rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells, and allow the RRC to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. Similarly, in July 2015, January 2016 and September 2016, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OCC”) issued various orders and regulations applicable to disposal operations in specific counties in Oklahoma. These rules require that disposal well operators, among other things, conduct additional mechanical integrity testing, ensure that their wells are not injecting wastes in targeted formations and/or reduce the volumes of wastes disposed in such wells. The OCC’s actions have resulted in reductions in volume of 50% for injection wells in some areas where increased seismic activity has occurred. 

19

In addition, in July 2014, the EPA sent a letter to the California Environmental Protection Agency and California Natural Resources Agency describing “serious deficiencies” in the state’s UIC Program and setting forth comprehensive requirements and deadlines for bringing the program into compliance with federal regulations by February 2017. In its letter, the EPA mandated an in-depth review of all existing Class II wells in California that may be injecting into non-exempt aquifers as well as a review of the state’s aquifer exemption process. In addition, the EPA directed the state to prohibit new and existing injections into aquifers that have not been approved as exempt by the EPA by February 15, 2017. The state responded by promulgating Aquifer Exemption Compliance Schedule regulations that became effective on April 20, 2016. The regulations set a final deadline of February 15, 2017 for Class II injection wells to stop injecting into non-exempt waters and are projected to affect more than 460 injection wells. Although none of the Partnership’s wells are affected by these regulations, if new regulatory initiatives are implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in our operations, our costs to operate may significantly increase and our ability to continue production may be delayed or limited, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial position.
Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. In addition, the EPA has adopted new rules under the Clean Air Act that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers, pneumatic pumps, and storage vessels. The Clean Air Act also imposes leak detection requirements for new or modified well sites, compressor stations, and natural gas processing plants. Compliance with these rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business. More recently, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules under the Clean Air Act regarding criteria for aggregating multiple sites into a single source for air quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities (such as compressor stations), on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements, which in turn could result in operational delays or require us to install costly pollution control equipment. States can also impose air emissions limitations that are more stringent than the federal standards imposed by the EPA, and California air quality laws and regulations are in many instances more stringent than comparable federal laws and regulations. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Regulatory requirements relating to air emissions are particularly stringent in Southern California. Rules restricting air emissions may require a number of modifications to our operations including the installation of new equipment. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our operating results. However, we believe our operations will not be materially adversely affected by any such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly situated companies involved in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into dense subsurface rock formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel, and in February 2014 issued guidance for such activities. The EPA has also issued final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act establishing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, and finalized effluent limitation guidelines in June 2015 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. In addition, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule. A final decision has not yet been issued. 
At the state level, several states, including California, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming, have adopted and/or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, the California Department of Conservation rules, effective July 2015, require the approval of Well Stimulation Treatment Notices before starting stimulation treatment, disclosure of the fluids used and adoption of groundwater monitoring and water management plans. They also govern 
20

resident notifications, storage and handling of fluids and well integrity. We do not expect any material adverse impact to result from these rules. In addition, several local jurisdictions in California and Florida have proposed or adopted various forms of moratoria or bans on hydraulic fracturing. In some cases, these measures include broad terms which, if enacted or upheld, could affect current operations. We do not believe that any current local proposal or measures will have a material adverse effect on the Partnership as a whole.
In December 2016, at the federal level, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on water resources. The EPA report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water sources “under some circumstances,” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. Since the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, this years-long study report does not appear to provide any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level. 
Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These or future studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
Climate Change. In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has issued regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. These regulations include limits on tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles and pre-construction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. In December 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the greenhouse gases monitoring and reporting rules. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. More recently, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. In November 2016, the EPA issued a final Information Collection Request seeking information needed to help the agency regulate methane and other emissions from existing sources. The BLM finalized similar rules in November 2016 that limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands through limitations on the venting and flaring of gas, as well as enhanced leak detection and repair requirements, but it is unclear when and whether these rules will be implemented. Compliance with rules to control methane emissions will likely require enhanced record-keeping practices, the purchase of new equipment such as optical gas imaging instruments to detect leaks, and the increased frequency of maintenance and repair activities to address emissions leakage. The rules will also likely require hiring additional personnel to support these activities or the engagement of third party contractors to assist with and verify compliance with these new and proposed rules, which could increase the cost of our operations. In California, the state Air Resources Board has proposed the adoption of new regulations governing methane emissions from oil and gas production operations. These new rules are expected to brought to public hearing in 2017. These new and proposed rules could result in increased compliance costs for the Partnership.
In addition, Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and many of the states have already established greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.
California has been one of the leading states in adopting greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements, and has implemented a cap and trade program as well as mandates for renewable fuels sources. California’s cap and trade program requires us to report our greenhouse gas emissions and essentially sets maximum limits or caps on total emissions of greenhouse gases from all industrial sectors that are or become subject to the program. This includes the oil and natural gas extraction sector of which we are a part. Our main sources of greenhouse gas emissions for our Southern California oil and 
21

gas operations are primarily attributable to emissions from internal combustion engines powering generators to produce electricity, flares for the disposal of excess field gas and drilling rigs. Under the California program, the cap declines annually from 2013 through 2020. In January 2017, California proposed to extend the cap and trade program beyond 2020 based on California’s greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements being extended through 2030. Under the cap and trade program, we are required to obtain authorizations for each metric ton of greenhouse gases that we emit, either in the form of allowances (each the equivalent of one ton of carbon dioxide) or qualifying offset credits. A portion of the allowance will be granted by the state, but any shortfall between the state-granted allowance and the facility’s emissions will have to be addressed through the purchase of additional allowances either from the state or a third party. The availability of allowances will decline over time in accordance with the declining cap, and the cost to acquire such allowances may increase over time. However, we do not expect the cost to be material to our operations.
The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances, or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements or they could promote the use of alternative fuels and thereby decrease demand for the oil and gas that we produce. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produced. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. Such climatic events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Pipeline Safety. Some of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and analogous state agencies in some cases under the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, which was reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006. The DOT, through the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for gas, NGL and condensate transmission pipelines as well as certain low stress pipelines and gathering lines transporting hazardous liquids, such as oil, that, in the event of a failure, could affect “high consequence areas.” “High consequence areas” are currently defined to include areas with specified population densities, buildings containing populations with limited mobility, areas where people may gather along the route of a pipeline (such as athletic fields or campgrounds), environmentally sensitive areas and commercially navigable waterways. Under the DOT’s regulations, integrity management programs are required to include baseline assessments to identify potential threats to each pipeline segment, implementation of mitigation measures to reduce the risk of pipeline failure, periodic reassessments, reporting and record keeping. In two steps taken in 2008 and 2010, PHMSA extended its integrity management program requirements to hazardous liquid gathering lines located in “unusually sensitive areas,” such as locations containing sole-source drinking water aquifers, endangered species or other protected ecological resources. 
Also, in March of 2015, PHMSA finalized new rules applicable to gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that, among other changes, impose new post-construction inspections, welding, gas component pressure testing requirements, as well as requirements for calculating pressure reductions for immediate repairs on liquid pipelines. In October 2015, PHMSA proposed new regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines that would significantly extend and expand the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements, regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to a high consequence area. The proposal also requires new reporting requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including all gathering lines. To date, PHMSA has not published the final rule in the Federal Register. More recently, in May 2016, PHMSA proposed rules that would, if adopted, impose more stringent requirements for certain gas lines. Among other things, the proposed rulemaking would extend certain of PHMSA’s current regulatory safety programs for gas pipelines beyond “high consequence areas” to cover gas pipelines found in newly defined “moderate consequence areas” that contain as few as five dwellings within the potential impact area and would also require gas pipelines installed before 1970 that are currently exempted from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressures (“MAOP”). Other new requirements proposed by PHMSA under the rulemaking would require pipeline operators to: report to PHMSA in the event of certain MAOP exceedances; strengthen PHMSA integrity management requirements; consider seismicity in evaluating threats to a pipeline; conduct hydrostatic testing for all pipeline segments manufactured using longitudinal seam welds; and use more detailed guidance from PHMSA in the selection of assessment methods to inspect pipelines. The proposed rulemaking also seeks to impose a number of requirements on gathering lines. Additional future regulatory action expanding PHMSA jurisdiction and imposing stricter integrity management requirements is likely. In June 2016, the President signed into law legislation that, among other things, requires PHMSA to conduct an assessment of its inspections process and integrity management programs for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. The legislation also requires PHMSA to prioritize various rulemakings required by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 and propose and finalize the rules mandated by the Act. At this time, we cannot predict the cost of additional potential pipeline 
22

safety rulemakings, but they could be significant. Moreover, fines and penalties may be imposed on pipeline operators that fail to comply with PHMSA requirements, and such operators may also become subject to orders or injunctions restricting pipeline operations. Violations of the pipeline safety laws and regulations that occur after January 2012 can result in fines of up to $200,000 per violation per day, with a maximum of $2 million for a series of violations.
Endangered Species. The Endangered Species Act and similar state statutes prohibit certain actions that harm endangered or threatened species and their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or oil and gas development. This could result in increased costs to us, and could delay or restrict drilling program activities, any of which could adversely impact our business. The presence of any protected species or the final designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could result in increased costs from species protection measures or could result in limitations, delays, or prohibitions on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop and produce our reserves. 
Activities on Federal Lands. Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. The Partnership’s exploration and production operations include activities on federal lands. For those current activities as well as for future or proposed exploration and development plans on federal lands, governmental permits or authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA are required. This process has the potential to delay, limit or increase the cost of developing oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt projects.
OSHA and Other Laws and Regulation. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, OSHA Process Safety Management, the EPA community right-to know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. 
We believe that compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For instance, we did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures during 2017. However, accidental spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including those relating to claims for damage to property and persons. In addition, we expect to be required to incur remediation costs for property, wells and facilities at the end of their useful lives. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations or ability to make distributions to our unitholders.
Other Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry
The oil and gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.
Legislation continues to be introduced in Congress and development of regulations continues in the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies concerning the security of industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities. Our operations may be subject to such laws and regulations. Presently, it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any such facility security laws or regulations, but such expenditures could be substantial.
23

Production Regulation. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate, also regulate one or more of the following:

• | the location of wells;


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and


• | notice to surface owners and other third parties.

The various states regulate the drilling for, and the production of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Production taxes vary by state. All states in which we operate impose ad valorem taxes on our oil and gas properties. Various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil, NGLs and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Currently, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming impose severance taxes on producers at rates ranging from 1% to 13% of the value of the gross product extracted. Wyoming and Oklahoma wells that reside on Native American or federal land are subject to an additional tax of 8.5% and 8.0%, respectively. Florida sulfur sales are subject to a tax of $6.13 per long ton. In Wyoming, Florida and Michigan, reduced rates may apply to certain types of wells and production methods, such as new wells, renewed wells, stripper production and tertiary production. California does not currently impose a severance tax but taxes minerals in place. Attempts by California to impose a similar tax have been introduced in the past.
States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowances from oil and gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill. Our Los Angeles Basin properties are located in urbanized areas, and certain drilling and development activities within these fields require local zoning and land use permits obtained from individual cities or counties. These permits are discretionary and, when issued, usually include mitigation measures which may impose significant additional costs or otherwise limit development opportunities.
Natural Gas Gathering Pipeline Regulation. Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) as a natural gas company under the NGA. There is, however, no bright-line test for determining the jurisdictional status of pipeline facilities. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of substantial, on-going litigation, and, therefore, the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels. If our natural gas gathering pipelines were subject to FERC’s jurisdiction, we would be required to file a tariff with FERC, provide a cost justification for the transportation charge and obtain certificate(s) of public convenience and necessity for the FERC-regulated pipelines. Our natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject to the more stringent application of state or federal regulation of rates and services.
Our natural gas gathering operations are subject to regulation in the various states in which we operate. The level of such regulation varies by state. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Our natural gas gathering operations also may be or become subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Natural Gas Transportation Pipeline Regulation. Our sole interstate natural gas pipeline is an 8.3 mile pipeline in Kentucky that connects with the Texas Gas Transmission interstate pipeline. Under the NGA, FERC has authority to regulate natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. Its authority to regulate those services includes the rates charged for the services, terms and conditions of service, certification and construction of new facilities, the extension or abandonment of services and facilities, the maintenance of accounts and 
24

records, the acquisition and disposition of facilities, the initiation and discontinuation of services and various other matters. Natural gas companies may not charge rates that have been determined not to be just and reasonable by FERC. In addition, FERC prohibits FERC regulated natural gas facilities from unduly preferring, or unduly discriminating against, any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service or other matters. Our 8.3 mile pipeline is subject to a limited jurisdiction FERC certificate, and we are not currently required to maintain a tariff at FERC. We cannot be assured that our 8.3 mile pipeline will always maintain its limited jurisdiction status, and we may be required to establish rates and file a FERC tariff in the future, which may have an adverse impact on our revenues. Pursuant to FERC’s jurisdiction, existing rates and/or other tariff provisions may be challenged by complaint and rate increases proposed by the pipeline or other tariff charges may be challenged by protest. A successful complaint or protest related to our facilities could have an adverse impact on our revenue.
Our intrastate natural gas transportation pipelines are subject to regulation by applicable state regulatory commissions that can affect the rates we charge and terms of service. The level of such regulation varies by state. Although state regulations are typically less onerous than FERC, state regulations typically require pipelines to charge just and reasonable rates and to provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Additionally, FERC has adopted certain regulations and reporting requirements applicable to intrastate and Hinshaw natural gas pipelines that provide certain interstate services subject to FERC’s jurisdiction. We could become subject to such regulations and reporting requirements in the future to the extent that any of our intrastate pipelines were to begin providing, or were found to provide, such interstate services. Failure to comply with federal or state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas pipeline industry are pending before Congress, FERC and in the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these on our natural gas operations. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such actions materially differently than other midstream natural gas companies with whom we compete.
Liquids Pipeline Regulation. We own a 51 mile oil pipeline in Oklahoma and Texas that is a common carrier pipeline and subject to regulation by FERC under the October 1, 1977, version of the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”) and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (“EPAct 1992”). The ICA and its implementing regulations give FERC authority to regulate the rates charged for service on the interstate common carrier liquids pipelines and generally require the rates and practices of interstate liquids pipelines to be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory. The ICA also requires these pipelines to keep tariffs on file with FERC that set forth the rates the pipeline charges for providing transportation services and the rules and regulations governing these services. EPAct 1992 and its implementing regulations allow interstate common carrier oil pipelines to annually index their rates up to a prescribed ceiling level. FERC retains cost-of-service ratemaking, market‑based rates and settlement rates as alternatives to the indexing approach. The ICA also requires these pipelines to keep tariffs on file with FERC that set forth the rates the pipelines charge for providing transportation services and the rules and regulations governing these services. On January 27, 2016, in Docket No. OR16-10-000, we received a temporary waiver of the filing and reporting requirements of sections 6 and 20 of the ICA. On February 2, 2016, we filed a cancellation of our tariffs. We cannot be assured that our 51 mile oil pipeline will always maintain its temporary waiver, and we may be required to establish rates and file a FERC tariff in the future, which may have an adverse impact on our revenues. 
Natural Gas Processing Regulation. Our natural gas processing operations are not presently subject to FERC regulation. There can be no assurance that our processing operations will continue to be exempt from other FERC regulation in the future.
Our processing facilities are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. The price and terms of access to pipeline transportation can be subject to extensive federal and in state regulation. FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting the interstate transportation of natural gas, and to a lesser extent, the interstate transportation of NGLs. These initiatives also may indirectly affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas and NGLs under certain circumstances. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these regulatory changes to our processing operations.
Regulation of Sales of Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs. The price at which we buy and sell oil, natural gas and NGLs is currently not subject to federal regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect the sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Although the prices are not currently regulated, Congress has historically been active in the area of natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate prices for energy commodities might be proposed, and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on the operations of our business.
25

With regard to our physical purchases and sales of these energy commodities and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), as further described below. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines and penalties as well as related third party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
In November 2009, the FTC issued regulations pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry. Violators of the regulations face civil penalties of up to $1 million per violation per day. In July 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which incorporated an expansion of the authority of the CFTC to prohibit market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC. This authority, with respect to liquids swaps and futures contracts, is similar to the anti-manipulation authority granted to the FTC with respect to liquids purchases and sales. In July 2011, the CFTC issued final rules to implement their new anti-manipulation authority. The rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of $1 million or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation. For a description of FERC’s anti market manipulation rules, see “Energy Policy Act of 2005” below.
Our sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. As noted above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation can be subject to extensive federal and state regulation. FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting the interstate transportation of natural gas, and to a lesser extent, the interstate transportation of oil and NGLs. These initiatives also may indirectly affect the intrastate transportation of oil, natural gas and NGLs under certain circumstances. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these regulatory changes to our oil, natural gas and NGL marketing operations, and we do not believe that we would be affected by any such FERC action materially differently than other oil, natural gas and NGL marketers with whom we compete.
Energy Policy Act of 2005. On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed into law the Domenici-Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”). EPAct 2005 is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. With respect to regulation of natural gas transportation, EPAct 2005 amended the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”) by increasing the criminal penalties available for violations of each Act. EPAct 2005 also added a new section to the NGA, which provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day for each violation of the NGA and increased FERC’s civil penalty authority under the NGPA from $5,000 per violation per day to $1,000,000 per violation per day. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in FERC-jurisdictional transportation and the sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce. EPAct 2005 also amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior in contravention of rules and regulations to be prescribed by FERC. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of EPAct 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rules make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (3) engage in any act, practice or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any entity. The new anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, including the annual reporting requirements under Order No. 704 (described below). The anti-market manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC’s enforcement authority. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, FERC and the courts.
FERC Market Transparency Rules. Under Order No. 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors, natural gas marketers, and natural gas producers, are required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year.
