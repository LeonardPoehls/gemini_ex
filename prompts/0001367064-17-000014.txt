Item 1.  Business
General
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in June 2006 and are the U.S. market leader in the full-service natural gas compression industry. As of December 31, 2016, public unitholders held a 55% ownership interest in us and Archrock, Inc. (individually, and together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, “Archrock”) owned our remaining equity interests, including our general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights. Archrock General Partner, L.P., our general partner, is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Archrock and has sole responsibility for conducting our business and for managing our operations, which are conducted through our wholly-owned limited liability company, Archrock Partners Operating LLC. Because our general partner is a limited partnership, its general partner, Archrock GP LLC, conducts our business and operations. Archrock GP LLC’s board of directors and officers, which we sometimes refer to as our board of directors and our officers, make decisions on our behalf. All of those directors are elected by Archrock.
Our contract operations services primarily include designing, sourcing, owning, installing, operating, servicing, repairing and maintaining equipment to provide natural gas compression services to our customers. We monitor our customers’ compression services requirements over time and, as necessary, modify the level of services and related equipment we employ to address changing operating conditions. We only operate in one segment; see the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 (“Financial Statements”) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our results of operations and financial condition.
We are a party to an omnibus agreement with Archrock, our general partner and others (as amended and/or restated, the “Omnibus Agreement”), which includes, among other things:

• | certain agreements not to compete between Archrock and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us and our affiliates, on the other hand;


• | Archrock’s obligation to provide all operational staff, corporate staff and support services reasonably necessary to operate our business and our obligation to reimburse Archrock for such services;


• | the terms under which we, Archrock, and our respective affiliates may transfer, exchange or lease compression equipment among one another;


• | Archrock’s grant to us of a license to use certain intellectual property, including our logo; and


• | Archrock’s and our obligations to indemnify each other for certain liabilities.

Our general partner does not receive any compensation for managing our business, but it is entitled to reimbursement of all direct and indirect expenses incurred on our behalf. Archrock and our general partner are also entitled to distributions on their limited partner interest and general partner interest, respectively and, if specified requirements are met, our general partner is entitled to distributions on its incentive distribution rights. During the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, our general partner received $4.8 million in distributions on its incentive distribution rights. For further discussion of our cash distribution policy, see “Cash Distribution Policy” included in Part II, Item 5 (“Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities”) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
During each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we acquired from Archrock contract operations service agreements and a fleet of compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements (the 2016 acquisition is referred to as the “November 2016 Contract Operations Acquisition” and the 2015 acquisition is referred to as the “April 2015 Contract Operations Acquisition”).
On November 19, 2016, at the closing of the November 2016 Contract Operations Acquisition, we acquired from Archrock contract operations customer service agreements with 63 customers and a fleet of 262 compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements, comprising approximately 147,000 horsepower, or approximately 4% (of then available 
2

horsepower) of the combined U.S. contract operations business of Archrock and us. Total consideration for the transaction was $85.0 million, excluding transaction costs. In connection with the acquisition, we issued approximately 5.5 million common units to Archrock and approximately 111,000 general partner units to our general partner. 
On March 1, 2016, we completed an acquisition of contract operations customer service agreements with four customers and a fleet of 19 compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements comprising approximately 23,000 horsepower. The $18.8 million purchase price was funded with $13.8 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility, a non-cash exchange of 24 compressor units for $3.2 million, and the issuance of 257,000 common units for $1.8 million. In connection with this acquisition, we issued and sold 5,205 general partner units to our general partner so it could maintain its approximate 2% general partner interest in us. This acquisition is referred to as the “March 2016 Acquisition.”
On April 17, 2015, at the closing of the April 2015 Contract Operations Acquisition, we acquired from Archrock contract operations customer service agreements with 60 customers and a fleet of 238 compressor units used to provide compression services under those agreements, comprising approximately 148,000 horsepower, or 3% (of then available horsepower) of the combined contract operations business of Archrock and us. The acquired assets also included 179 compressor units, comprising approximately 66,000 horsepower, previously leased from Archrock to us. In connection with this acquisition, we issued approximately 4.0 million common units to Archrock and approximately 80,000 general partner units to our general partner. Based on the terms of the contribution, conveyance and assumption agreement relating to this acquisition, the common units and general partner units, including incentive distribution rights, we issued in connection with this acquisition were not entitled to receive a cash distribution relating to the quarter ended March 31, 2015. 
Archrock Spin-off Transaction
On November 3, 2015, Exterran Holdings, Inc. completed the spin-off (the “Spin-off”) of its international contract operations, international aftermarket services and global fabrication businesses through the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Exterran Corporation (“Exterran”). Upon the completion of the Spin-off, Exterran Holdings, Inc. was renamed “Archrock, Inc.” and, on November 4, 2015, the ticker symbol for Archrock’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was changed to “AROC.” Archrock continues to hold interests in us, which include the sole general partner interest and certain limited partner interests, as well as all of the incentive distribution rights. Effective on November 3, 2015, we were renamed “Archrock Partners, L.P.” and, on November 4, 2015, the ticker symbol for our common units on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was changed to “APLP.”
Exterran Holdings, Inc. completed an internal restructuring on November 3, 2015 in connection with the Spin-off which we believe, when combined with the sale or exchange of Partnership units during the 12 months prior to the Spin-off, resulted in a technical termination of the Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the date of the Spin-off. The technical termination did not affect our consolidated financial statements nor did it affect our classification as a partnership or otherwise affect the nature or extent of our “qualifying income” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our taxable year for all unitholders ended on November 3, 2015 and resulted in a deferral of depreciation deductions that were otherwise allowable in computing the taxable income of our unitholders. This deferral of depreciation deductions may have resulted in increased taxable income (or reduced taxable loss) to certain of our unitholders in 2015.
Contract Operations Services Overview
We provide comprehensive contract operations services, including the personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supplies to meet our customers’ natural gas compression needs. Based on the operating specifications at the customer’s location and the customer’s unique compression needs, these services include designing, sourcing, owning, installing, operating, servicing, repairing and maintaining equipment. When providing contract operations services, we work closely with a customer’s field service personnel so that the compression services can be adjusted to efficiently match changing characteristics of the natural gas reservoir and the natural gas produced. We routinely repackage or reconfigure a portion of our existing fleet to adapt to our customers’ compression services needs. We utilize both slow and high speed reciprocating compressors primarily driven by internal natural gas fired combustion engines. We also utilize rotary screw compressors for specialized applications.

Our equipment is maintained in accordance with established maintenance schedules. These maintenance procedures are updated as technology changes and as Archrock develops new techniques and procedures. Because Archrock’s field technicians provide maintenance on substantially all of our contract operations equipment, they are familiar with the condition of our equipment and can readily identify potential problems. In our and Archrock’s experience, these maintenance procedures maximize equipment life and unit availability, minimize avoidable downtime and lower the overall maintenance expenditures over the equipment life. Generally, each of our compressor units undergoes a major overhaul once every four to eight years, depending on the type, size and utilization of the unit. If a unit requires maintenance or reconfiguration, we utilize Archrock’s maintenance personnel to service it as quickly as possible to meet our customers’ needs.
Our customers typically contract for our contract operations services on a site-by-site basis for a specific monthly service rate that is generally reduced if we fail to operate in accordance with the applicable contract requirements. Following the initial minimum term for our contract compression services, which is typically around twelve months, contract compression services generally continue on a month to month basis until terminated by either party with 30 days’ advance notice. Our customers generally are required to pay our monthly service fee even during periods of limited or disrupted natural gas flows, which enhances the stability and predictability of our cash flows. Additionally, because we typically do not take title to the natural gas we compress, and the natural gas we use as fuel for our compressors is supplied by our customers, we have limited direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations. See “General Terms of our Contract Operations Customer Service Agreements,” below, for a more detailed description.
We intend to continue to work with Archrock to manage our respective fleets as one pool of compression equipment from which we can each readily fulfill our respective customers’ service needs. When one of Archrock’s salespersons is advised of a new contract operations services opportunity allocable to us, he or she will obtain relevant information concerning the project, including natural gas flow, pressure and natural gas composition, and then review our and Archrock’s fleets for an available and appropriate compressor unit. In some instances, we may choose to purchase newly-fabricated equipment to fulfill our customers’ needs if no idle equipment is available in our fleet. Please read Part III, Item 13 (“Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence”) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our ability to share or exchange compression equipment with Archrock.
The size and horsepower of our natural gas compressor fleet on December 31, 2016 is summarized in the following table:

Range of Horsepower Per Unit | Number of Units | Aggregate Horsepower (in thousands) | | % of Horsepower
0-200 | 2,427 | | 278 | | 9 | %
201-500 | 1,825 | | 492 | | 15 | %
501-800 | 381 | | 241 | | 7 | %
801-1,100 | 198 | | 189 | | 6 | %
1,101-1,500 | 1,045 | | 1,426 | | 43 | %
1,501 and over | 333 | | 664 | | 20 | %
Total(1) | 6,209 | | 3,290 | | 100 | %


(1) | Includes four compressor units, comprising approximately 1,000 horsepower, leased from Archrock and excludes six compressor units, comprising approximately 6,000 horsepower, leased to Archrock (see Note 4 (“Related Party Transactions”) to our Financial Statements).

Over the last several years, Archrock has undertaken efforts to standardize its compressor fleet around major components and key suppliers. Because a significant portion of our fleet consists of Archrock’s former fleet, we benefit from these efforts, as well. Standardization of our fleet:

• | enables us to minimize our fleet operating costs and maintenance capital requirements;


• | facilitates low-cost compressor resizing; and


• | allows us to develop improved technical proficiency in our maintenance and overhaul operations, which enables us to achieve high run-time rates while maintaining lower operating costs.

As mentioned above, pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, Archrock provides us with all operational staff, corporate staff and support services necessary to run our business.

Competitive Strengths
We believe we have the following key competitive strengths:

• | Our relationship with Archrock. Our relationship with Archrock and our access to its personnel, logistical capabilities, geographic scope and operational efficiencies allow us to provide a full complement of contract operations services. We and Archrock intend to continue to manage our respective compression fleets as one pool of compression equipment from which we can more easily fulfill our respective customers’ needs. This relationship also gives us an advantage in pursuing compression opportunities throughout the U.S. As of December 31, 2016, Archrock owned approximately 0.5 million horsepower of compression equipment, excluding the compression equipment owned by us, in its contract operations business. Archrock intends for us to be the primary long-term growth vehicle for its contract operations business. 


• | Superior customer service. We believe we operate in a relationship-driven, service-intensive industry and therefore need to provide superior customer service. We believe that our regionally-based network, local presence, experience and in-depth knowledge of customers’ operating needs and growth plans enable us to respond to our customers’ needs and meet their evolving demands on a timely basis. In addition, we focus on achieving a high level of reliability for the services we provide in order to maximize our customers’ production levels. Our sales efforts concentrate on demonstrating our commitment to enhancing our customers’ cash flow through superior customer service. 


• | Fee-based cash flows. We charge a fixed monthly fee for our contract operations services that our customers are generally required to pay, regardless of the volume of natural gas we compress in that month. We believe this fee structure reduces volatility and enhances our ability to generate relatively stable and predictable cash flows. 


• | Large fleet in substantially all major U.S. producing regions. We operate in substantially all major oil and natural gas producing regions in the U.S. Our large fleet and numerous operating locations throughout the U.S., combined with our ability, as a result of our relationship with Archrock, to efficiently move equipment among producing regions, means that we are not dependent on production activity in any particular region. We believe our size, geographic scope and broad customer base provide us with improved operating expertise and business development opportunities. 

Business Strategies
We intend to continue to capitalize on our competitive strengths to meet our customers’ needs through the following key strategies:

• | Leverage our relationship with Archrock. Our relationship with Archrock provides us numerous revenue and cost advantages, including the ability to access compression equipment, deploy that equipment in most of the major natural gas producing regions in the U.S. and provide maintenance and operational support on a more cost effective basis than we could without this relationship. Following the Spin-off, we believe that Archrock will be more focused on growing our contract operations business, increasing our operating efficiencies and enhancing our customer service. 


• | Capitalize on the long-term fundamentals for the U.S. natural gas compression industry. We believe our ability to efficiently meet our customers’ evolving compression needs, our long-standing customer relationships and our large compressor fleet will enable us to capitalize on what we believe are favorable long-term fundamentals for the U.S. natural gas compression industry. These fundamentals include significant natural gas resources in the U.S., increased unconventional natural gas production, decreasing natural reservoir pressures, expected increased natural gas demand in the U.S. from growth in liquefied natural gas exports, exports of natural gas via pipeline to Mexico, power generation and industrial uses, and the continued need for compression services. 


• | Lower costs and improve profitability. As the largest provider of natural gas compression services in the U.S., we intend to use our scale to achieve cost savings in our operations. We are also focused on increasing productivity and optimizing our processes. By making our systems and processes more efficient, we intend to lower our internal costs and improve our profitability over time. 


• | Grow our business organically and through acquisitions. We plan to grow our business over time through the potential future acquisition of additional assets from compression providers and natural gas transporters or producers. We also plan to grow our business organically over the long term by adding new horsepower in key growth areas, including by providing compression services to producers of oil and natural gas from shale and liquids rich plays.

Natural Gas Compression Industry Overview
Natural gas compression is a mechanical process whereby the pressure of a given volume of natural gas is increased to a desired higher pressure for transportation from one point to another. It is essential to the production and transportation of natural gas. Compression is typically required several times during the natural gas production and transportation cycle, including (i) at the wellhead, (ii) throughout gathering and distribution systems, (iii) into and out of processing and storage facilities and (iv) along intrastate and interstate pipelines.

• | Wellhead and Gathering Systems — Natural gas compression is used to transport natural gas from the wellhead through the gathering system. At some point during the life of natural gas wells, reservoir pressures typically fall below the line pressure of the natural gas gathering or pipeline system used to transport the natural gas to market. At that point, natural gas no longer naturally flows into the pipeline. Compression equipment is applied in both field and gathering systems to boost the pressure levels of the natural gas flowing from the well allowing it to be transported to market. Changes in pressure levels in natural gas fields require periodic changes to the size and/or type of on-site compression equipment. Additionally, compression is used to reinject natural gas into producing oil wells to maintain reservoir pressure and help lift liquids to the surface, which is known as secondary oil recovery or natural gas lift operations. Typically, these applications require low- to mid-range horsepower compression equipment located at or near the wellhead. Compression equipment is also used to increase the efficiency of a low-capacity natural gas field by providing a central compression point from which the natural gas can be produced and injected into a pipeline for transmission to facilities for further processing.


• | Pipeline Transportation Systems — Natural gas compression is used during the transportation of natural gas from the gathering systems to storage or the end user. Natural gas transported through a pipeline loses pressure over the length of the pipeline. Compression is staged along the pipeline to increase capacity and boost pressure to overcome the friction and hydrostatic losses inherent in normal operations. These pipeline applications generally require larger horsepower compression equipment (1,500 horsepower and higher).


• | Storage Facilities — Natural gas compression is used in natural gas storage projects for injection and withdrawals during the normal operational cycles of these facilities.


• | Processing Applications — Compressors may also be used in combination with natural gas production and processing equipment and to process natural gas into other marketable energy sources. In addition, compression services are used for compression applications in refineries and petrochemical plants.

Many natural gas producers, transporters and processors outsource their compression services due to the benefits and flexibility of contract compression. Changing well and pipeline pressures and conditions over the life of a well often require producers to reconfigure or replace their compressor units to optimize the well production or gathering system efficiency.
We believe outsourcing compression operations to compression service providers such as us offers customers:

• | the ability to efficiently meet their changing compression needs over time while limiting the underutilization of their owned compression equipment;


• | access to the compression service provider’s specialized personnel and technical skills, including engineers and field service and maintenance employees, which we believe generally leads to improved production rates and/or increased throughput;


• | the ability to increase their profitability by transporting or producing a higher volume of natural gas through decreased compression downtime and reduced operating, maintenance and equipment costs by allowing the compression service provider to efficiently manage their compression needs; and


• | the flexibility to deploy their capital on projects more directly related to their primary business by reducing their compression equipment and maintenance capital requirements.

We believe the U.S. natural gas compression services industry continues to have growth potential over time due to, among other things, increased natural gas production in the U.S. from unconventional sources and aging producing natural gas fields that will require more compression to continue producing the same volume of natural gas, and expected increased demand for natural gas in the U.S. for power generation, industrial uses and exports, including liquefied natural gas exports and exports of natural gas via pipeline to Mexico.

Trends and Outlook
Our business environment and corresponding operating results are affected by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves in the U.S. Spending by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies is dependent upon these companies’ forecasts regarding the expected future supply, demand and pricing of oil and natural gas products as well as their estimates of risk-adjusted costs to find, develop and produce reserves. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets. Our revenue, earnings and financial position are affected by, among other things, market conditions that impact demand and pricing for natural gas compression, our customers’ decisions between using our services or our competitors’ services, our customers’ decisions regarding whether to own and operate the equipment themselves and the timing and consummation of any acquisition of additional contract operations customer service agreements and equipment from third parties. Although we believe our contract operations business is typically less impacted by commodity prices than certain other oil and natural gas service providers, changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending normally result in changes in demand for our services.
Natural gas consumption in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 0.6% to approximately 27,223 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”) compared to approximately 27,395 Bcf for the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) forecasts that total U.S. natural gas consumption will increase by 0.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. The EIA estimates that the U.S. natural gas consumption level will be approximately 30 trillion cubic feet (“Tcf”) in 2040, or 15% of the projected worldwide total of approximately 203 Tcf.`
Natural gas marketed production in the U.S. for the twelve months ended November 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 1.2% to 28,380 Bcf compared to 28,725 Bcf for the twelve months ended November 30, 2015. The EIA forecasts that total U.S. natural gas marketed production will increase by 2% in 2017 compared to 2016. The EIA estimates that the U.S. natural gas production level will be approximately 35 Tcf in 2040, or 17% of the projected worldwide total of approximately 202 Tcf.
Historically, oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity in the U.S. have been volatile. For example, the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was $3.71 per million British thermal unit (“MMBtu”) at December 31, 2016, which was approximately 31% higher and 63% higher than prices at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and the U.S. natural gas liquid composite price was $5.45 per MMBtu for the month of November 2016, which was approximately 4% higher and 29% higher than prices for the months of September 2016 and December 2015, respectively. While prices at December 31, 2016 improved relative to the comparable periods above, lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices during 2015 and 2016 as compared to 2014 prices caused many companies to reduce their natural gas drilling and production activities during 2015 and further reduce those activities during 2016 from their 2014 levels in select shale plays and in more mature and predominantly dry gas areas in the U.S., where we provide a significant amount of contract operations services. In addition, the West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot price was $53.75 per barrel at December 31, 2016, which was approximately 13% higher and 45% higher than prices at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. While the price at December 31, 2016 improved relative to the comparable periods above, lower West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices during 2015 and 2016 as compared to 2014 prices resulted in a continued decrease in capital investment and in the number of new oil wells drilled by exploration and production companies in 2016 compared to 2015. Because we provide a significant amount of contract operations services related to the production of associated gas from oil wells and the use of gas lift to enhance production of oil from oil wells, our operations and our levels of operating horsepower are also impacted by crude oil drilling and production activity.
As a result of the reduction in capital spending and drilling activity by U.S. producers in 2016, we experienced a decline in operating horsepower and an increase in pricing pressure during 2016 compared to 2015, though we achieved improved contract operations gross margin percentage and lower selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015, attributable in part to our cost management efforts. 
According to the Barclays 2017 Global E&P Spending Outlook, North America upstream spending is expected to increase by 27% in 2017. Due to the forecasted increase in customer spending in 2017, we anticipate horsepower returns will moderate during 2017 compared to 2016. We also anticipate investing more capital in new fleet units in 2017 than we did in 2016 to take advantage of expected improving market conditions during 2017. However, because compression service providers are a later cycle participant during improving markets, we anticipate any significant increase in the demand for our contract operations services will lag an increase in drilling activity. Also, given the operating horsepower declines and pricing pressure experienced in 2016, we expect to see a decline in our contract operations revenue in 2017 compared to 2016.

Oil and Natural Gas Industry Cyclicality and Volatility
Changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending normally results in changes in demand for our services; however, we believe our contract operations business is typically less impacted by commodity prices than certain other oil and natural gas service providers because:

• | compression is necessary for natural gas to be delivered from the wellhead to end users;


• | the need for compression services and equipment has grown over time due to the increased production of natural gas, the natural pressure decline of natural gas producing basins and the increased percentage of natural gas production from unconventional sources; and


• | our contract operations business is tied primarily to oil and natural gas production and consumption, which are generally less cyclical in nature than exploration activities.

Because we typically do not take title to the natural gas we compress, and the natural gas we use as fuel for our compressors is supplied by our customers, our direct exposure to commodity price risk is further reduced.
Seasonal Fluctuations
Our results of operations have not historically reflected any material seasonal tendencies and we currently do not believe that seasonal fluctuations will have a material impact on us in the foreseeable future.
Customers
Our current customer base consists of companies engaged in various aspects of the oil and natural gas industry, including natural gas producers, processors, gatherers, transporters and storage providers. We have entered into preferred vendor arrangements with some of our customers that give us preferential consideration for the compression needs of these customers. In exchange, we provide these customers with enhanced product availability, product support and favorable pricing. 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Williams Partners (formerly known as “Access”) accounted for approximately 17% and 16% of our revenue, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, Access accounted for approximately 12% of our revenue. Access merged with Williams Partners, L.P. (“Williams Partners”), a publicly traded limited partnership controlled by the Williams Companies, Inc. (“Williams Parent”), in February 2015 and, on an as-combined basis, Access and Williams Partners would have accounted for approximately 15% of our consolidated revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (“Anadarko”) accounted for approximately 10% and 10%, of our revenue, respectively. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014. 
Sales and Marketing
Our marketing and client service functions are coordinated and performed by Archrock sales and field service personnel. Salespeople and field service personnel regularly visit our customers to ensure customer satisfaction, to determine customer needs as to services currently being provided and to ascertain potential future compression services requirements. This ongoing communication allows us to quickly identify and respond to customer requests.
General Terms of our Contract Operations Customer Service Agreements
The following discussion describes select material terms common to our standard contract operations service agreements. We typically enter into a master service agreement with each customer that sets forth the general terms and conditions of our services, and then enter into a separate supplemental service agreement for each distinct site at which we will provide contract operations services.
Term and Termination.  Our customers typically contract for our contract operations services on a site-by-site basis. Following the initial minimum term for our contract compression services, which is typically around twelve months, contract compression services generally continue until terminated by either party with 30 days’ advance notice.
8

Fees and Expenses.  Our customers pay a fixed monthly fee for our contract operations services, which generally is based on expected natural gas volumes and pressures associated with a specific application. Our customers generally are required to pay our monthly fee even during periods of limited or disrupted natural gas flows. We are typically responsible for the costs and expenses associated with our compression equipment used to provide the contract operations services, other than fuel gas, which is provided by our customers.
Service Standards and Specifications.  We provide contract operations services according to the particular specifications of each job, as set forth in the applicable contract. These are typically turn-key service contracts under which we supply all service and support and use our own compression equipment to provide the contract operations services as necessary for a particular application. In certain circumstances, if the availability of our services does not meet certain percentages specified in our contracts, our customers are generally entitled, upon request, to specified credits against our service fees.
Title; Risk of Loss.  We own and retain title to or have an exclusive possessory interest in all compression equipment used to provide the contract operations services and we generally bear risk of loss for such equipment to the extent not caused by gas conditions, our customers’ acts or omissions or the failure or collapse of the customer’s over-water job site upon which we provide the contract operations services.
Insurance.  Typically, both we and our customers are required to carry general liability, worker’s compensation, employers’ liability, automobile and excess liability insurance. Archrock insures our property and operations and is substantially self-insured for worker’s compensation, employer’s liability, property, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles Archrock absorbs under its insurance arrangements for these risks.
Suppliers
Prior to the Spin-off, our sole supplier of newly-fabricated equipment was Archrock. On November 3, 2015, in connection with Archrock’s contribution of its global fabrication business to Exterran in the Spin-off, we entered into a supply agreement with Exterran under which, during the term of the agreement, we are required to purchase our requirements of newly-fabricated compression equipment from Exterran and its affiliates, subject to certain exceptions. Pursuant to the supply agreement, if we acquire a new business that is not party to a firm supply agreement, then we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to order such business’s newly fabricated compressor requirements from Exterran. If, however, the new business is already party to a firm supply agreement, then we may continue to order such equipment under that existing third-party supply agreement as long as orders for the succeeding twelve-month period do not exceed such business’s orders for the prior twelve-month period. We may also transfer, exchange or lease compression equipment with Archrock.
We rely on Exterran, who in turn relies on a limited number of suppliers, for some of the components used in our newly-fabricated equipment. We believe alternative sources of these components are generally available but at prices that may not be as economically advantageous to us as those offered by Exterran. We believe Exterran’s relations with its suppliers are satisfactory.
Competition
The natural gas compression services business is highly competitive. Overall, we experience considerable competition from companies that may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within our industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of available opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. We believe we are competitive with respect to price, equipment availability, customer service, flexibility in meeting customer needs, technical expertise, quality and reliability of our compressors and related services.
Increased size and geographic scope offer compression services providers operating and cost advantages. As the number of compression applications and size of the compression fleet increases, the number of required sales, administrative and maintenance personnel increases at a lesser rate, resulting in operational efficiencies and potential cost advantages. Additionally, broad geographic scope allows compression service providers to more efficiently provide services to all customers, particularly those with compression applications in remote locations. Our relationship with Archrock allows us to access a diverse fleet of compression equipment and a broad geographic base of operations and related operational personnel that we believe gives us more flexibility in meeting our customers’ needs than many of our competitors. We also believe that our relationship with Archrock provides us with resources that allow us to efficiently manage our customers’ compression service needs.
9

Non-competition Arrangement with Archrock
Under the Omnibus Agreement, subject to the provisions described below, Archrock has agreed not to offer or provide compression services to our contract operations services customers that are not also contract operations services customers of Archrock. Compression services include natural gas contract compression services, but exclude fabrication of compression equipment, sales of compression equipment or material, parts or equipment that are components of compression equipment, leasing of compression equipment without also providing related compression equipment service, gas processing operations services and operation, maintenance, service, repairs or overhauls of compression equipment owned by third parties. Similarly, we have agreed not to offer or provide compression services to Archrock’s contract operations services customers that are not also our contract operations services customers.
Some of our customers are also Archrock’s contract operations services customers, which we refer to as overlapping customers. We and Archrock have agreed, subject to the exceptions described below, not to provide contract operations services to an overlapping customer at any site at which the other was providing such services to an overlapping customer on the date of the most recent amendment to the Omnibus Agreement, each being referred to as a “Partnership site” or an “Archrock site,” as applicable. Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, if an overlapping customer requests contract operations services at a Partnership site or an Archrock site, whether in addition to or in replacement of the equipment existing at such site on the date of the most recent amendment to the Omnibus Agreement, we may provide contract operations services if such overlapping customer is a Partnership overlapping customer, and Archrock will be entitled to provide such contract operations services if such overlapping customer is an Archrock overlapping customer. Additionally, any additional contract operations services provided to a Partnership overlapping customer will be provided by us and any additional services provided to an Archrock overlapping customer will be provided by Archrock.
Archrock also has agreed that new customers for contract compression services are for our account unless the new customer is unwilling to contract with us or unwilling to do so under our form of compression services agreement. In that case, Archrock may provide compression services to the new customer. If we or Archrock enter into a compression services contract with a new customer, either we or Archrock, as applicable, will receive the protection of the applicable non-competition arrangements described above in the same manner as if such new customer had been a compression services customer of either us or Archrock on the date of the Omnibus Agreement.
The non-competition arrangements described above do not apply to:

• | our provision of contract compression services to a particular Archrock customer or customers, with the approval of Archrock;


• | Archrock’s provision of contract compression services to a particular customer or customers of ours, with the approval of the conflicts committee of our board of directors;


• | our purchase and ownership of not more than five percent of any class of securities of any entity that provides contract compression services to Archrock’s contract compression services customers;


• | Archrock’s purchase and ownership of not more than five percent of any class of securities of any entity that provides contract compression services to our contract compression services customers;


• | Archrock’s ownership of us;


• | our acquisition, ownership and operation of any business that provides contract compression services to Archrock’s contract compression services customers if Archrock has been offered the opportunity to purchase the business for its fair market value from us and Archrock declines to do so. However, if neither the Omnibus Agreement nor the non-competition arrangements described above have already terminated, we will agree not to provide contract compression services to Archrock’s customers that are also customers of the acquired business at the sites at which Archrock is providing contract operations services to them at the time of the acquisition;

• | Archrock’s acquisition, ownership and operation of any business that provides contract compression services to our contract operations services customers if we have been offered the opportunity to purchase the business for its fair market value from Archrock and we decline to do so with the concurrence of the conflicts committee of our board of directors. However, if neither the Omnibus Agreement nor the non-competition arrangements described above have already terminated, Archrock will agree not to provide contract operations services to our customers that are also customers of the acquired business at the sites at which we are providing contract operations services to them at the time of the acquisition; or


• | a situation in which one of our customers (or its applicable business) and a customer of Archrock (or its applicable business) merge or are otherwise combined, in which case, each of we and Archrock may continue to provide contract operations services to the applicable combined entity or business without being in violation of the non-competition provisions, but Archrock and the conflicts committee of our board of directors must negotiate in good faith to implement procedures or such other arrangements, as necessary, to protect the value to each of Archrock and us of the business of providing contract operations services to each such customer or its applicable business.

Unless the Omnibus Agreement is terminated earlier due to a change of control of Archrock GP LLC, our general partner or us, the non-competition provisions of the Omnibus Agreement will terminate on December 31, 2018 or on the date on which a change of control of Archrock occurs, whichever event occurs first. If a change of control of Archrock occurs, and neither the Omnibus Agreement nor the non-competition arrangements have already terminated, Archrock will agree for the remaining term of the non-competition arrangements not to provide contract operations services to our customers at any site where we are providing contract operations services at the time of the change of control.
Environmental and Other Regulations
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment and to occupational safety and health. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and safety and health laws and regulations and that continued compliance with currently applicable requirements would not have a material adverse effect on us. However, the trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in these laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, emission or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
The primary U.S. federal environmental laws to which our operations are subject include the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and regulations thereunder, which regulate air emissions; the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and regulations thereunder, which regulate the discharge of pollutants in industrial wastewater and storm water runoff; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and regulations thereunder, which regulate the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and regulations thereunder, known more commonly as “Superfund,” which imposes liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances in the environment. We are also subject to regulation under the U.S. federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and regulations thereunder, which regulate the protection of the safety and health of workers. Analogous state and local laws and regulations may also apply.
Air Emissions
The CAA and analogous state laws and their implementing regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various sources, including natural gas compressors, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require a facility to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations, or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Our standard contract operations agreement typically provides that the customer will assume permitting responsibilities and certain environmental risks related to site operations.

New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”)
On June 3, 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued final regulations amending the NSPS for the oil and natural gas source category and applying to sources of emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds (“VOC”) from certain processes, activities and equipment that is constructed, modified or reconstructed after September 18, 2015. Specifically, the regulation contains both methane and VOC standards for several emission sources not currently covered by the NSPS, such as fugitive emissions from compressor stations and pneumatic pumps and methane standards for certain emission sources that are already regulated for VOC, such as equipment leaks at natural gas processing plants. The amendments also establish methane standards for a subset of equipment that the current NSPS regulates, including reciprocating compressors and pneumatic controllers, and extend the current VOC standards to the remaining unregulated equipment. At this time, we do not believe the rule will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.
Venting and Flaring on Federal Lands
On November 18, 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management published final regulations to reduce venting and flaring on federal and tribal lands. The regulation requires leak detection inspections at compressor stations and imposes requirements to reduce emissions from pneumatic controllers, among other things. This regulation may require us to incur material costs to comply.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”)
On October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a new NAAQS ozone standard of 70 parts per billion (ppb), which is a reduction from the 75 ppb standard set in 2008. This new standard became effective on December 28, 2015. The states are expected to establish revised attainment/non-attainment regions based on the revised ozone standard by approximately October 2017, utilizing air quality data collected between 2014 and 2016. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our customers’ ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”)
In addition, in January 2011, the TCEQ finalized revisions to certain air permit programs that significantly increase air emissions-related requirements for new and certain existing oil and gas production and gathering sites in the Barnett Shale production area. The final rule established new emissions standards for engines, which could impact the operation of specific categories of engines by requiring the use of alternative engines, compressor packages or the installation of aftermarket emissions control equipment. The rule became effective for the Barnett Shale production area in April 2011, and the lower emissions standards will become applicable between 2020 and 2030 depending on the type of engine and the permitting requirements. A number of other states where our engines are operated have adopted or are considering adopting additional regulations that could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements for engines, some of which could entail material costs to comply. At this point, however, we cannot predict whether any such rules would require us to incur material costs.
Source Aggregation
On June 3, 2016, the EPA issued final rules under the CAA regarding criteria for aggregating multiple sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, such as compressor stations, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements, which in turn could result in operational delays or require the installation of costly pollution control equipment.
Generally
These new regulations and proposals, when finalized, and any other new regulations requiring the installation of more sophisticated pollution control equipment or the adoption of other environmental protection measures, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.

Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased compliance costs.
The U.S. Congress has previously considered legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. One bill, passed by the House of Representatives in 2009, but never adopted by the full Congress, would have required greenhouse gas emissions reductions by covered sources of as much as 17% from 2005 levels by 2020 and by as much as 83% by 2050. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other initiatives continue to be proposed that may be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. In addition, almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that smaller sources such as our gas-fired compressors could become subject to greenhouse gas-related regulation. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations.
Independent of Congress, the EPA has promulgated regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions under its existing CAA authority. The EPA has adopted rules requiring many facilities, including petroleum and natural gas systems, to inventory and report their greenhouse gas emissions. These reporting obligations were triggered for some sites we operated in 2016.
In addition, the EPA in June 2010 published a final rule providing for the tailored applicability of air permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA reported that the rulemaking was necessary because without it certain permitting requirements would apply as of January 2011 at an emissions level that would have greatly increased the number of required permits and, among other things, imposed undue costs on small sources and overwhelmed the resources of permitting authorities. In the rule, the EPA established two initial steps of phase-in to minimize those burdens, excluding certain smaller sources from greenhouse gas permitting until at least April 30, 2016. On January 2, 2011, the first step of the phase-in applied only to new projects at major sources (as defined under those CAA permitting programs) that, among other things, increase net greenhouse gas emissions by 75,000 tons per year. On July 1, 2011, the second step of the phase-in began requiring permitting for otherwise minor sources of air emissions that have the potential to emit at least 100,000 tons per year of greenhouse gases. On June 29, 2012, the EPA issued final regulations for “Phase III” of its program, retaining the permitting thresholds established in Phases I and II. On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that greenhouse gas emissions alone cannot trigger an obligation to obtain such an air permit even if the project will substantially increase the source’s greenhouse gas emissions. However, for those sources that trigger such air permitting requirements based on their traditional criteria pollutant emissions, the permit must include a limit for greenhouse gases. In addition, the Court concluded that the rule was flawed because the EPA failed to identify a de minimis threshold for greenhouse gases below which Best Available Control Technology would not be required. As of October 3, 2016, the EPA published a proposed rule that would set that de minimis threshold at 75,000 tons per year, effectively restoring the permitting levels that the agency was applying prior to the Supreme Court’s 2014 decision. The requirement for large sources of greenhouse gas emissions to obtain and comply with permits will affect some of our and our customers’ largest new or modified facilities going forward.
Although it is not currently possible to predict how any proposed or future greenhouse gas legislation or regulation by Congress, the states or multi-state regions will impact our business, any legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.
Water Discharges
The CWA and analogous state laws and their implementing regulations impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the U.S. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. In addition, the CWA regulates storm water discharges associated with industrial activities depending on a facility’s primary standard industrial classification. Several of Archrock’s facilities on which we may store inactive compression units are required to have industrial wastewater discharge permits under local wastewater ordinances, which Archrock has obtained. U.S. federal laws also require development and implementation of spill prevention, controls, and countermeasure plans, including appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture, or leak at such facilities.
13

Waste Management and Disposal
RCRA and analogous state laws and their implementing regulations govern the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. During the course of our operations, we generate wastes (including, but not limited to, used oil, antifreeze, filters, sludges, paints, solvents and abrasive blasting materials) in quantities regulated under RCRA. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for these types of wastes. CERCLA and analogous state laws and their implementing regulations impose strict, and under certain conditions, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and past owners and operators of the facility or disposal site where the release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.
While we do not own any material facilities or properties, we use Archrock’s properties for the storage and maintenance and repair of inactive compressor units and lease some properties used in support of our operations. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons, hazardous substances, or other regulated wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties used or leased by us or on or under other locations where such materials have been taken for disposal by companies sub-contracted by us. In addition, many of these properties have been previously owned or operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or other regulated wastes was not under our control. These properties and the materials released or disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate historical property contamination, or to perform certain operations to prevent future contamination. At certain of such sites, Archrock is currently working with the prior owners who have undertaken to monitor and clean up contamination that occurred prior to Archrock’s acquisition of these sites. We are not currently under any order requiring that we undertake or pay for any cleanup activities. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not receive any such order in the future.
Occupational Safety and Health
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the safety and health of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.
Indemnification for Environmental Liabilities
Under the Omnibus Agreement, Archrock has agreed to indemnify us, for a three-year period following each applicable asset acquisition from Archrock, against certain potential environmental claims, losses and expenses associated with the ownership and operation of the acquired assets that occur before the acquisition date. Archrock’s maximum liability for environmental indemnification obligations under the Omnibus Agreement cannot exceed $5 million, and Archrock will not have any obligation under the environmental or any other indemnification until our aggregate losses exceed $250,000. Archrock will have no indemnification obligations with respect to environmental claims made as a result of additions to or modifications of environmental laws promulgated after such acquisition date. We have agreed to indemnify Archrock against environmental liabilities occurring on or after the applicable acquisition date related to our assets to the extent Archrock is not required to indemnify us.
Employees and Labor Relations
We do not have any employees. Under the Omnibus Agreement, we reimburse Archrock for the allocated costs of its personnel who provide direct or indirect support for our operations. Archrock considers its employee relations to be satisfactory.
