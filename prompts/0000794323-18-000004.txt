ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Introduction
We are an international facilities-based provider of a broad range of integrated communications services. A facilities-based provider is a provider that owns or leases a substantial portion of the plant, property and equipment necessary to provide its services. We have created our international communications network by constructing our own assets and through a combination of purchasing other companies and purchasing or leasing facilities from others. We designed our network to provide communications services that employ and take advantage of rapidly improving underlying optical, Internet Protocol, computing and storage technologies.
On November 1, 2017, we and CenturyLink, Inc., a Louisiana corporation (“CenturyLink”), completed a business combination pursuant to which Wildcat Merger Sub 1 LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CenturyLink, merged with and into Level 3 (the “Initial Merger”) with Level 3 continuing as the surviving corporation and, immediately following the Initial Merger, the surviving corporation merged with and into WWG Merger Sub LLC, another wholly owned subsidiary of CenturyLink, with WWG Merger Sub LLC continuing as the surviving company (together with the Initial Merger, the “CenturyLink Acquisition”) under the new name of Level 3 Parent, LLC.
In the CenturyLink Acquisition, our stockholders received $26.50 in cash and 1.4286 shares of CenturyLink common stock for each share of Level 3 common stock they owned at the effective time of the Initial Merger (the “exchange ratio”), with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. 
Our company was incorporated as Peter Kiewit Sons’, Inc. in Delaware in 1941 to continue a construction business founded in Omaha, Nebraska in 1884. In subsequent years, we invested a portion of the cash flow generated by our construction activities in a variety of other businesses, including, among other things, the communications business. In 1998, our historical construction business was split off from the remainder of our operations. In conjunction with the split-off, we changed our name to “Level 3 Communications, Inc.,” and the entity that was split-off and held the prior construction business was named “Peter Kiewit Sons’, Inc.”
We sold various businesses subsequent to the split-off, including our coal mining business in November 2011, as part of our long-term strategy to focus on core communications business operations. Most recently, in October 2011, we acquired Global Crossing Limited and in October 2014 we acquired tw telecom inc. The results of operations of the companies that we have acquired have been included in our consolidated results of operations since the respective closing date of the acquisition.
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 12,300 total employees. We believe that our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.

Business Overview, Vision and Strategy
Level 3 seeks to achieve its business objectives by focusing on:

• | maximizing the value of our network for our customers by expanding the breadth and depth of our network, and connecting our customers to their digital ecosystem of data and applications, which we refer to as “digital transformation;”


• | delivering an exceptional and consistent customer experience by innovating to improve the efficiency and scalability of our operating platform; and


• | generating profitable growth by expanding our enterprise customer base and layering value-added services onto existing network and operational capabilities.

We strive to create a culture and business environment that makes it easy for customers to do business with us, and providing high-performing, reliable and secure services on our local-to-global network with superior price value. We focus on operational excellence to streamline our systems and business processes to deliver a superior customer experience, and to reduce overhead costs and transactional costs for ourselves and for our customers.
We believe that we can be successful by making our customers the focal point of all we do. Our value proposition is structured to be fully aligned with helping our customers meet their growth, efficiency and security business challenges both today and in the future and across the globe wherever our services are available.
We believe that advances in optical and Internet Protocol, or IP, technologies have facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, decreases in unit costs for communications service providers that are able to most effectively take advantage of these technology advances. We believe that, over time, rapidly improving technologies and high demand elasticity will continue to drive this market dynamic.
Enterprises are increasingly moving their content and applications to third party providers of on-demand server and storage resources to reduce the costs and complexity of their information technology, or IT, operations. Since these server and storage resources can be offsite in any location and are often virtualized (as opposed to residing on dedicated hardware in a known location) they are referred to as “Cloud Services.” We believe that this migration of enterprise data and applications to the Cloud will drive increased demand for our high-performing, reliable and secure network services.
Today’s market drivers can be broken into three categories as they pertain to our core business strategy:

• | Growth. We expect digital data creation and the associated demand for bandwidth to keep growing, as business relationships and supply chains become increasingly digital, and end users increasingly expect to be able to access their data and applications anytime and anywhere. Cloud application adoption continues to grow for all businesses, especially our enterprise customers. Mobility and Internet connected device proliferation continue to increase the rate at which content - especially video - is consumed, which in turn results in increased demand for higher bandwidth to enable that delivery and consumption. A rapidly increasing number of smart homes, cars, and everyday objects are getting connected to the network (the “Internet of Things”), further increasing demand for scalable and secure bandwidth. Globalization trends continue as customers look for growth from emerging markets, particularly with respect to enterprise customers. Additional opportunities for growth are present as a result of changing regulatory requirements in industries such as healthcare, consumer privacy, and financial services. 


• | Efficiency. As traffic volumes grow, our customers are not only under pressure to keep up with this growth but also to do so more efficiently. Accordingly, our product and technology teams take

 7

advantage of the scale and capabilities of our network and continuously innovate to deliver cost-effective services that meet customer needs.

• | Security. Cyber threats continue to escalate, which affects both us and our customers. As more enterprise customer data and applications move to the Cloud, and as more and more consumer devices and personal information become reachable through the Internet, maintaining a secure network and collection of systems and processes is more important than ever.

Technology innovation in Internet Protocol and optical networking technologies has resulted in improvement in the functionality of applications supported by these technologies. We believe that this rapid innovation will continue well into the future across a number of different aspects of the communications marketplace.
We believe that decreases in communications services costs and prices enable the development of new bandwidth intensive applications, which, over time, result in even more significant increases in bandwidth demand. In addition, we believe that communications services are direct substitutes for other existing modes of information distribution from sources such as traditional broadcast entertainment as well as distribution of software, audio and video content using physical media delivered through physical transportation systems. An example of this dynamic is the use of the Internet for the distribution of video. We believe that as communications services improve more rapidly than traditional content distribution systems, demand for Internet delivered video will continue to grow rapidly. We also believe that high elasticity of demand for both new applications and the substitution for existing distribution systems will continue for the foreseeable future.
We also believe that there are significant implications that result from these market dynamics. First, given the improvement in optical and Internet Protocol technologies, communications service providers that are most effective at rapidly deploying new services that take advantage of these technologies will have an inherent cost and service advantage over companies that are less effective at deploying new services that use these technologies. In addition, given the consolidation in the number of local access providers (that is, the providers of connections from intercity networks to traffic aggregation points or end user locations), communications service providers that have ownership of local and/or metropolitan network facilities will have an inherent cost and service advantage over companies that do not have ownership over these types of assets. With respect to the migration to Cloud Services, this market dynamic creates opportunities for us to provide secure and high performance network connections to our enterprise customers, enabling their employees to connect seamlessly and efficiently to their content and applications in the Cloud.
In view of these market and technology opportunities, we seek to serve business customers by using a customer-first focus and providing a broad range of communications services over our advanced and extensive fiber optic network. With our network’s extensive geographic reach and deep reach into major metropolitan areas of the United States, Europe and Latin America, we are positioned to provide end-to-end services for business customers entirely on our own facilities across multiple continents.
We have and will continually expand our fiber optic network to new locations where the demands of our customers and potential customers justify the upfront costs of expansion. This allows us to provide an end-to-end connection for the customer across our own fiber optic network, which is more secure and efficient and allows us to deliver a superior customer experience. Today and for the foreseeable future, we will need to connect to some locations using the networks of other carriers. We manage these relationships with other carriers to make the interconnection as efficient and effective as possible. We seek to minimize the need for these “off network” connections by targeting customers whose needs can be met primarily over our network and by building our network to as many high-traffic locations as possible.
Our fiber optic network has extensive reach across North America, Europe and Latin America. Our network reaches not only hundreds of cities (we refer to the part of our network connecting the larger cities as our “intercity” network) but also includes fiber optic routes around the various parts of the larger metropolitan areas (we refer to this part of our network as our “metropolitan” or “metro” networks), which allows us to connect directly with 
 8

wholesale customers in major traffic aggregation centers (such as central offices of local exchange carriers) and with many medium and large enterprise customers at their offices and data centers. In addition, the fact that our metro networks have significant reach throughout major metropolitan areas means that we can make relatively short network extensions to reach customer locations that our network does not currently reach.
To connect our networks in North America, Europe and Latin America, as well as to connect our network to cities in other parts of the world, we own several undersea cables and have purchased capacity on cables owned by others. Since subsea cables require very large upfront investment and have very large capacity compared to the needs of any one carrier, they typically are either owned by consortia of carriers or are financed significantly by selling a large amount of capacity to other carriers either before the cable is built or shortly thereafter. We historically have been active both in building undersea cables and in buying capacity from others. Today we own more than 37,500 route miles of undersea fiber optic cables around the world. In addition, as we have POPs in Asia, Africa and Australia, we have also purchased capacity on others’ undersea cables to allow us to offer services in those regions despite the fact that we do not have extensive fiber optic networks of our own in these regions. This is important to our ability to handle the global needs of our multinational customers. For more information about our network, see Item 1, “Business - Our Communication Network” below.
For larger customers, specialized real estate is often required to house the equipment that we and the customer use to exchange traffic. This space requires a concentrated amount of electric power and cooling, as well as server racks, fiber optic cables and other technical equipment. Such specialized real estate, depending upon its nature and the type of companies that use it, is referred to variously as “colocation” or “data center” space. For interconnection among wholesale carriers and some of the largest enterprise customers, we also use real estate owned by third parties. 
Our business includes voice services. Historically, end-user voice services were provided over a network of local exchange carriers whose copper wire networks were dedicated to that service. Today, voice services can be carried over the Internet as a data service. This type of voice service usually is referred to as “voice over Internet Protocol,” or “VoIP”. Since many calls include a connection to the traditional voice network on one end and a VoIP connection on the other, early in our existence we became deeply involved in managing connections between VoIP customers and those on the traditional public switched telephone network. This involves not only developing and managing equipment and software specialized for that purpose but also developing physical connections of our Internet Protocol network with the traditional networks of the various local exchange carriers. Additionally, we have also physically interconnected our IP network with the networks of many cellular telephone carriers. This enables us to provide what we believe is a more comprehensive service than most other carriers can provide to handle customers’ needs for voice connections in today’s changing communications environment. Our services that manage the initiation or termination of customers’ voice calls generally are referred to as “local voice” services. Our voice services also include our comprehensive suite of audio, web and video collaboration services.
We also provide services that handle the termination of large volumes of telephone calls on behalf of other carriers. We refer to these as “wholesale voice” services. These services are provided in a very competitive environment in which many carriers participate and the customer typically uses automated systems to choose the least expensive way to terminate traffic to each city around the world on a minute-by-minute basis.
We provide specialized communications services for companies that distribute video or other digitized content across the Internet. Because the amount of bandwidth required by such media is large, special services are used to ensure delivery of such content at desired levels of quality. We have developed a system of servers, with software to control them, that store more popular content in various locations around the world. The aim is to store content so that it is not transferred very far across the Internet. This type of service typically is referred to as a “Content Delivery Network,” or “CDN.” We also have specialized video services to handle the needs of broadcasters for the rapid transmission of the very large streams of information that emerge when live events are broadcast. We carry these video streams across our network to locations specified by the broadcasters and from which these customers broadcast their final edited content.
 9

Managing the transmission of information across our network requires the proper management of many interconnected technologies, processes and systems to provide high quality, convenient secure and reliable services for our customers. Some of these services may be charged for separately, while others are included as an integral part of our more basic services. Examples of services that are typically charged separately include network security (i.e., helping customers keep their information safe) and network monitoring (i.e., keeping customers informed of the status of various equipment and sub-parts of their connections). We regularly develop new features and ancillary services to keep our network services as valuable as possible to our target customers.
Since a large portion of our communications services are purchased by companies to interconnect their own information technology applications, often we find that certain customers need ancillary services that are not clearly part of communications network services and may more properly be described as information technology services. In an effort to ensure that our customers receive a superior overall experience, we frequently enter into partnerships with providers that specialize in these information technology services, so that we can assemble the full collection of services for the customer. In making the decision to add such services, we consider several factors including our core strengths, the existence of other parties with whom we can work to satisfy the customers’ needs, how important it is to customers that the new service be combined into a single Level 3 offering, and the size of the incremental market that would become addressable by offering such services. For more information about our service offerings, see Item 1, “Business - Our Service Offerings” below.
We are currently focusing our attention on a number of operational and financial objectives, including:

• | driving profitable revenue growth by increasing sales generated by our Core Network Services;


• | growing our enterprise customer base as well as our share of their telecom spend, as this customer group has the largest potential for significant growth;


• | continually improving the customer experience to increase customer retention and reduce customer churn;


• | launching new products and services to meet customer needs, in particular for enterprise customers;


• | reducing network costs and operating expenses relative to our revenue;


• | growing positive cash flows from operations;


• | concentrating our capital expenditures on those technologies and assets that enable us to increase our Core Network Services revenue;


• | integrating our prior acquisitions, building on the strengths and capabilities of the acquired legacy companies to position the combined company as a premier global communications provider; and


• | managing our Wholesale Voice Services for margin contribution.

For a discussion of our Core Network Services and Wholesale Voice Services, see Item 1, “Business-Our Service Offerings” below.

For a discussion of certain geographic information regarding how we manage our business, please see the discussion under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” appearing later in this Form 10-K.
Our Communications Network
Our network is an advanced, international, facilities based communications network. We primarily provide services over our own facilities and those of our affiliates. As of December 31, 2017, our network encompasses:

• | approximately 106,000 intercity route miles in North America, Europe and Latin America;


• | metropolitan fiber networks in approximately 350 markets containing approximately 69,000 route miles;


• | approximately eight million square feet of Gateway and transmission facilities in North America, Europe and Latin America;


• | more than 360 colocation and data center facilities globally;


• | approximately 37,500 route miles of subsea optical fiber cable systems; and


• | more than 60 countries in service around the world.

Terrestrial Intercity Networks. Our intercity network generally includes the following characteristics:
Optical fiber strands designed to accommodate Dense Wave Division Multiplexing, or DWDM, transmission technology. Our optical fiber strands are designed to accommodate DWDM technology. We believe that the installation of newer optical fibers will allow a combination of greater wavelengths of light per strand, higher transmission speeds and longer physical spacing between network electronics. We also believe that each new generation of optical fiber will allow increases in the performance of these network design aspects and will therefore enable lower unit costs.
High speed intercity DWDM equipment. Our high speed intercity DWDM equipment provides high quality, reliable and cost effective transmission across our fiber backbone. We are continually evaluating advancements in technology that will enable us to scale, lower our cost and provide higher speed services over our intercity network. We believe that the market will continue to move toward Ethernet based services and higher speed interfaces. Through our technology innovations we believe that we have positioned ourselves to be able to deliver these capabilities for both our own IP network needs as well as those of our customers.
Open, non-proprietary hardware and software interfaces. Our intercity network is designed to maximize the use of open, non-proprietary hardware and software interfaces to allow less costly upgrades as hardware and software technology improves.
Local Market Infrastructure. Our local facilities include fiber optic metropolitan networks connecting our intercity network and Gateways to buildings housing communications intensive end users, enterprise customers and traffic aggregation points-including ILEC and CLEC central offices, long distance carrier points-of-presence or POPs, cable head-ends, wireless providers’ facilities and Internet peering and transit facilities. Our high fiber count metropolitan networks allow us to extend our services directly to our customers’ locations at low costs, because the 
 15

availability of this network infrastructure does not require extensive multiplexing equipment to reach a customer location, which is required in ordinary fiber constrained metropolitan networks. 
We operate space for our Gateway and transmission facilities. Our initial Gateway facilities were designed to house local sales staff, operational staff, our transmission and Internet Protocol routing, Content Delivery Networks and voice switching facilities and technical space to accommodate colocation services that is, the colocation of equipment by high-volume Level 3 customers, in an environmentally controlled, secure site with direct access to Level 3’s network generally through dual, fault tolerant connections. Most of these facilities offer a complete set of data center services ranging from housing and hosting, to more complex managed solutions, including disaster recovery, applications management, business continuity, and security services to manage mission critical applications.
Transoceanic Networks. We own a number of subsea fiber optic cable systems, including Atlantic Crossing-1 (“AC-1”), Atlantic Crossing-2 (“AC-2”), Mid-Atlantic Crossing (“MAC”), South American Crossing (“SAC”), Pan American Crossing (“PAC”) and an approximately 300 route mile system connecting the U.K. and Ireland. AC-1 and AC-2 link our European network to our North American intercity network. MAC provides a strategic gateway between the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. and our Latin America assets. SAC connects major markets throughout Latin America and is one of only two sub-sea systems currently in operation that circumnavigates the majority of South America including an extension into Colombia. PAC is integrated terrestrial ring route (including associated backhaul) within Mexico, as well as an extension to Costa Rica.
We also own capacity in the TAT-14 transatlantic cable system. In 2016 we purchased and lit a fiber pair on the Apollo South cable system. We also are an owner of the Japan-US cable system, (were an owner on the China-US cable system which retired in December 2016), an indefeasible right of use, or IRU, holder on the Southern Cross cable system extending from Australia to California, as well as an owner of the Americas II cable extending from Florida to Brazil, and an IRU holder on the Arcos system in the Caribbean. We also own a share in the Hawaiian Inter Island Fiber Network (HIFN). In addition, we own capacity on the Global Cloud Exchange transatlantic system Flag Atlantic-1 and capacity on the Hibernia transatlantic cable system and also the Apollo North cable system.
Content Acquisition and Distribution Services Architecture. Content distribution network, or CDN, describes a system of computers networked together across the Internet to provide content to users in the most efficient manner to enable an optimal user experience. In a CDN, nodes or groups of computers are deployed in multiple locations closer to the end user, also known as the “edge of the network” and cooperate with each other to satisfy requests for content by end users, transparently moving content behind the scenes to optimize the delivery process. Requests for content are directed intelligently through sophisticated software applications to nodes that provide optimal performance for end users.
The CDN platform directs network traffic across our existing physical network and infrastructure. The CDN platform is composed of the edge server or computer that provides caching and streaming functions, and the global server that provides load balancing-that is, a computer that directs the traffic to the most efficient edge server to meet the end user’s request. The edge server enables the storage of popular content in a location that is closer to the end user and thereby reduces bandwidth requirements and improves response times for that stored content.
The Vyvx platform transmits audio and video programming for our customers over our fiber optic network and via satellite. We use our network to carry many live traditional broadcast and cable television events from the site of the event to the network control centers of the broadcasters of the event.

Our Patent Portfolio
Through acquisitions and through our own research and development, as of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,700 patents and patent applications in the United States and around the world. Our patent portfolio includes patents covering technologies ranging from data and voice services to content distribution to transmission and networking equipment.
In addition to the patents and patent applications we own, we have received licenses to patents held by others, including through a cross-license agreement with IBM entered into in December 2007, giving us access to technology covered by IBM’s approximately (at that time) 42,000 patents covering many technologies relevant to our business. While patents give us the right to prevent others, particularly competitors, from using our proprietary technologies, patent licenses give us the freedom to operate our business without the risk of interruption from the holder of the patent that has been licensed to us.
We use our patent portfolio in a number of ways. First, developing or acquiring technologies and receiving the legal right to preclude others from using them may give us a competitive advantage. Second, the breadth and depth of our patent portfolio may deter others, particularly telecommunications operators, from bringing patent infringement claims against us for fear of counter-claim by us. Most of the patent infringement suits brought against us to date have been initiated by patent-holding companies who do not operate telecommunications businesses and who are less likely to be subject to a counter-claim of infringement by us. Finally, the extensiveness of our patent portfolio gives us the option to cross-license with others having similarly broad portfolios on terms acceptable to us, mitigating the risk that others will wish to assert patent infringement claims against us.
We will continue to file new patent applications as we enhance and develop products and services, we will continue to seek opportunities to expand our patent portfolio through strategic acquisitions and licensing and we will continue to appropriately enforce our patents against infringement by others.
Business Support Systems
We believe that it is important to streamline and simplify our processes and systems. To pursue our business strategies, we have developed and are continuing to develop and implement a set of integrated software applications designed to automate our operational processes. These development activities also relate to the integration of the systems that were used by the companies that we have acquired and our new CenturyLink affiliates. We recognize that for the success of certain of our services that some of our business support systems will need to be easily accessible and usable directly by our customers.
In conjunction with CenturyLink integration efforts, we are currently developing and deploying simplified processes and systems that have been designed to streamline and synchronize our service, sales and operational functions. These processes and systems have been designed to provide improved capability in service catalog management, sales opportunity management, customer management, quoting, order entry, order workflow, physical and logical network inventory management, service management, and financial management.
Competition
The communications industry has been and remains highly competitive. In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, significant new capacity was deployed by both existing and new entrants. This oversupply led to a period of financial restructuring and industry consolidation. Given the significant economies of scale inherent in the communications industry, we believe further consolidation will occur such as CenturyLink’s acquisition of us and Verizon’s recently completed acquisition of XO.
Our primary competitors are long distance carriers, ILECs, CLECs, Post Telephone and Telegraphs, or PTTs, companies that operate Content Delivery Networks, or CDNs, and other companies such as cable companies, that 
 17

provide communications services. The following information identifies some key competitors for each of our service offerings.
Our key competitors for our IP and data services include Verizon, AT&T, NTT and Tata in North America, and BT, Orange, TeliaSonera and Tata in Europe. In Latin America, our main competitors are Telefonica, Telmex and national incumbent telecommunications carriers.
For transport and fiber services, our key competitors in North America are other facilities based communications companies including AT&T, Verizon, and Zayo. In Europe, our key competitors are other carriers such as PTT companies, BT, Orange, Vodafone, TeliaSonera, Colt, Interoute, KPN, Belgacom and Zayo. In Latin America, our main competitors are Telefonica, Telmex and national incumbent telecommunications carriers.
For voice services our key competitors are other providers of communications services including AT&T, Zscaler, Verizon, CLECs and national incumbent telecommunications carriers.
For our colocation and datacenter services, our key competitors are other facilities based communications companies, and other colocation providers such as web hosting companies and third-party colocation companies. In North America, these companies include Equinix, Terremark (Verizon), and CoreSite. In Europe, competitors include Equinix, Global Switch, InterXion, and Telehouse Europe. In Latin America, our largest competitors include Telefonica, Telmex, and IBM.
For CDN services, our key competitors include Akamai Technologies, Limelight Networks, Amazon, Edgecast Networks (Verizon), Fastly and CDNetworks.
For security services, our key competitors include Akamai, Verizon, AT&T and Cloudflare.
In the enterprise and government markets, our key competitors in North America include ILECs (such as AT&T and Verizon) and CLECs. In Europe, they include BT, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom and Orange. In Latin America, competitors include Telefonica and Telmex.
The communications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology. For instance, periodic technological advances permit substantial increases in transmission capacity of both new and existing fiber, and the introduction of new products or emergence of new technologies may reduce the cost or increase the supply of certain services similar to those which we plan on providing. Accordingly, in the future our most significant competitors may be new entrants to the communications industry, such as content companies that have existing significant customer bases and substantial cash resources that are greater than ours, and, unlike the traditional incumbent carriers we also compete with, would not be burdened by an installed base of outmoded or legacy equipment.
Regulation
U.S. Regulation
The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has jurisdiction over interstate and international communications services. We have obtained FCC approval to land our transoceanic cables in the United States. We have also obtained FCC authorization to provide international services on a facilities and resale basis, as well as via various wireless licenses. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), any entity, including cable television companies and electric and gas utilities, may enter any telecommunications market, subject to reasonable state regulation of safety, quality and consumer protection. The United States House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee continues to consider revising and updating the 1996 Act, including potential changes to the FCC, its jurisdiction, its operating procedures and its organizational structure. It is too early in this process for us to either predict any modifications that might be made to the 1996 Act as part of this process, their effects on us, or the pace at which this process may proceed.
 18

The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), previously required certain tariffs to define the services, terms, and conditions under which said services were to be offered. Subsequent deregulatory measures have eliminated some tariff requirements for competitive services.
However, our rates must still be “just and reasonable” and “nondiscriminatory” under the Communications Act. Our state tariffs remain in place where required (some states do not have, or have eliminated, the requirement to file certain tariffs). We have historically relied primarily on our sales force and marketing activities to provide information to our customers regarding these matters and expect to continue to do so. Further, in accordance with certain FCC requirements, we maintain a schedule of our rates, terms and conditions for our domestic and international private line services on our web site.
Special Access Regulation. Special access services are “lit” loop or transport facilities that support the transmission of data on a point-to-point basis, often referred to as “private lines.” Level 3 purchases a substantial amount of special access services from incumbent LECs (“ILECs”) and other telecommunications carriers to reach customer premises and, less frequently, to support interoffice transport requirements. In addition, Level 3 provides special access services to end user customers and to other carriers via its own network and/or through the resale of other carriers’ special access services. In 2017, the FCC concluded a proceeding relating to the regulatory framework governing the rates, terms, and conditions under which ILECs subject to “price cap” regulation provide interstate special access services. In that proceeding, the FCC decided to eliminate most of the rules governing the rates, terms and conditions of certain types of special access services in most areas of the country. That decision is being appealed in court, and we cannot predict the outcome of that appeal.
Network Neutrality and Open Internet. In February 2015, the FCC adopted regulations to regulate Internet services as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act. Following the Trump Administration taking office, a newly-constituted FCC voted to repeal most of those regulations in December 2017. Specifically, the FCC eliminated rules that regulated how ISPs could manage their networks, including, among other things, prohibiting ISPs from blocking or throttling certain Internet traffic. However, ISPs will be required to provide information regarding such practices to their users. The FCC’s 2017 order is scheduled to take effect following publication in the Federal Register. Opponents of the 2017 repeal of the 2015 rules are taking action to challenge the 2017 decision in court. Several states have also opposed the change and have initiated state executive orders and/or introduced legislation focused on state-specific Internet service regulation. 
Internet Network Interconnection. We have noted IP interconnection and congestion disputes with last mile broadband Internet providers, some of which historically refused to augment (or add) bandwidth at congested interconnection links between our respective networks (which is known to degrade the quality of third party content) without the payment of tolls unilaterally dictated by the broadband supplier. During 2015 and 2017, we concluded improved IP Interconnection agreements with several large broadband providers, some of which were announced publicly. We cannot predict whether these arrangements will in all cases provide us with sufficient last mile interconnection capacity to avoid Internet congestion as the Internet continues to grow and/or when these agreements expire. The FCC’s 2015 Open Internet rules provided Level 3 a forum to lodge interconnection disputes with the FCC for resolution, but how such disputes would be resolved, as well as the future of these or any Open Internet rules, is an open issue.
Intercarrier Compensation. Historically, telecommunications carriers would generally compensate one another for traffic carried on each other’s networks. Interexchange carriers paid access charges to local telephone companies for long distance calls that originated and terminated on local networks. Local telephone companies typically would charge one another for local and Internet-bound traffic terminating on each other’s networks. The methodology by which carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic, whether it be for local, intrastate or interstate traffic, has been under review by the FCC for over a decade.
Level 3 maintains approximately 300 interconnection agreements with other telecommunications carriers. These agreements set out the terms and conditions under which the parties will exchange traffic. The largest agreements are with AT&T and Verizon. Most of Level 3’s agreements with AT&T and Verizon have expired terms, but remain effective in evergreen status. As these and other interconnection agreements expire, we will continue to 
 19

evaluate simply allowing them to continue in evergreen status (so long as the counterparty allows it) or negotiating new agreements. Any renegotiation would involve uncertainty as to the final terms and conditions, including the compensation rates for various types of traffic. In addition, changes in law, including FCC orders, may allow or compel us to renegotiate current and successor interconnection agreements over the next year.
Intercarrier Compensation/VoIP. Pursuant to the USF/ICC Transformation Order, VoIP, while remaining unclassified as either an information or a telecommunications service, was prospectively categorized as either local or non-local traffic. If “local”, then VoIP traffic is subject to reciprocal compensation; if “non-local”, then it is subject to interstate rates, thus eliminating any intrastate access rate applicable to VoIP. The USF/ICC Transformation Order did not address the treatment of VoIP retroactively. Level 3 is involved in a number of intercarrier compensation disputes dealing with the rating of VoIP traffic. During 2015, the FCC issued clarifications concerning the rating of VoIP traffic that were favorable to Level 3. Those clarifications were appealed, with the Court ruling that additional action by the FCC is required to sustain its prior findings. At this time, we cannot predict whether the FCC will revisit this issue and reaffirm its previous decision or reconsider its previous determination.
Other VoIP Regulation. The FCC has imposed various regulatory requirements on VoIP providers that had previously been applicable only to traditional telecommunications providers, such as obligations to provide 911 functionality, to contribute to the federal universal service fund, to comply with regulations relating to local number portability (including contributing to the costs of managing number portability requirements), to abide by the FCC’s service discontinuance rules, to contribute to the Telecommunications Relay Services fund, and to abide by the regulations concerning Customer Proprietary Network Information and the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. In addition, a number of state public utility commissions are conducting regulatory proceedings that could affect our rights and obligations with respect to IP-based voice applications. Specifically, some states have taken the position that the “local” component of VoIP service is subject to traditional regulations applicable to local telecommunications services, such as the obligation to pay intrastate universal service fees. We cannot predict whether the FCC or state public utility commissions will impose additional requirements, regulations or charges upon our provision of services related to IP communications.
Intercarrier Compensation/Wireless. There are currently a number of lawsuits ongoing in the United States concerning the intercarrier compensation charges applicable to certain wireless telephone calls, how to determine whether those calls were local or long distance under the applicable rules, and what statute of limitations applies to such claims. We are defendants in certain of these lawsuits, and are potential plaintiffs in others. As with any litigation, the outcome of this litigation is difficult to predict.
Universal Service. Level 3 is subject to federal and state regulations that implement universal service support for access to communications services in rural and high-cost areas and to low-income consumers at reasonable rates; and access to advanced communications services by schools, libraries and rural health care providers. The FCC assesses Level 3 a percentage of interstate and international revenue it receives from retail customers as its contribution to the Federal Universal Service Fund, which assessments are generally passed on to our customers. Additionally, the FCC has ruled that states may assess contributions to their state Universal Service Funds from VoIP providers. Any change in the assessment methodology may affect Level 3’s revenue and expenses, but at this time it is not possible to predict the extent we would be affected, if at all.
Letter of Assurances. We are subject to the terms and conditions of a letter of assurances (“LOA”) between CenturyLink and certain agencies of the U.S. Government to address the U.S. Government’s national security, law enforcement and public safety concerns. The LOA is intended (i) to ensure our ability to carry out lawfully authorized U.S. Government electronic surveillance of communications that originate and/or terminate in the U.S.; (ii) to prevent and detect access to and use of U.S. communications; and (iii) to satisfy U.S. critical infrastructure protection requirements. Failure to comply with the obligations under the LOA could result in the revocation of our telecommunications licenses by the FCC and other penalties. The LOA also imposes significant requirements related to information storage and management, traffic routing and management, physical, logical and network security, personnel screening and training, audit, reporting and other matters.
 20

State Regulation
The 1996 Act is intended to increase competition in the telecommunications industry, especially in the local exchange market. With respect to local services, ILECs are required to allow interconnection to their networks and to provide unbundled access to network facilities, and several other pro-competitive measures.
State regulatory agencies have jurisdiction when our facilities and services are used to provide intrastate telecommunications services. A portion of our traffic may be classified as intrastate telecommunications and therefore subject to state regulation. We expect that we will offer more intrastate telecommunications services (including intrastate switched services) as our business and product lines expand. We are authorized to provide telecommunications services in all fifty states and the District of Columbia. In addition, we need to maintain interconnection agreements with ILECs where we wish to provide service. We expect that we should be able to negotiate or otherwise obtain renewals or successor agreements through adoption of others’ contracts or through arbitration proceedings, although the rates, terms, and conditions applicable to interconnection and the exchange of traffic with certain ILECs could change significantly in certain cases. The degree to which the rates, terms, and conditions may change will depend not only upon the negotiation and arbitration process and availability of other interconnection agreements, but will also depend in significant part upon state commission proceedings that either uphold or modify the current regimes governing interconnection and the exchange of certain kinds of traffic between carriers.
Some states also require prior approvals or notifications for certain transfers of assets, customers or ownership of certificated carriers and for issuances by certified carriers of equity or debt.
European Regulation
Unlike the United States which has a federal-state regulatory scheme, the European Union, or EU, has adopted a more systematic approach to the convergence of networks and the regulation of telecommunications services. The European Commission oversees the implementation by its Member States of various directives developed to regulate electronic communications. In March 2002, the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework for electronic communications that is designed to address in a technologically neutral manner the convergence of communications across telecommunications, computer and broadcasting networks. The directives address: (1) framework, (2) interconnection and access, (3) authorization and licensing, (4) universal service, and (5) privacy. These directives along with an additional decision on radio spectrum set out the basis for regulation at the national level.
Pursuant to these measures, the licensing regime was replaced with one of general authorization, whereby all providers of electronic communication services, or ECS, are authorized by statute in all 28 EU countries to (1) build/maintain a network and (2) sell any form of ECS, other than mobile or broadcast services, without the need for an individual license. Accordingly, as for all communications providers, our existing licenses were canceled and replaced with statutory authorization, subject to various general conditions imposed by national regulatory authorities, or NRAs. NRAs continue to be responsible for issuing specific licenses in relation to radio spectrum.
In November 2015, the EU adopted Regulation EU 2015/2120 which, among other things set out new legislation in relation to open internet. The net neutrality provisions of this Regulation became effective at the beginning of the second quarter 2016. In 2015, the EU Commission also began a review of the entire suite of Directives and Regulations relating to the communications sector and proposals are currently under consideration with a view to agreeing any changes in sufficient time to have these transposed into Member State law by 2019.

United Kingdom ‘Brexit’
In June 2016, following a national referendum, the UK decided to cease its membership in the EU. The European Treaty sets out the legal process that must be followed to accomplish this departure, but it has not yet been triggered. It is generally expected that the UK will remain a member of the EU until at least 2019. While there is likely to be little immediate effect for us or our customers, the longer-term implications are presently unclear.
Middle East and African Regulation
In recent years, we have expanded our operations beyond the borders of the European Union. While many jurisdictions have adopted regulatory regimes broadly similar to the European model and promote full competition, many of the countries in this region have not yet committed to liberalizing their telecommunications regimes and opening their telecommunications markets to foreign investment as part of the 1998 World Trade Organization Agreement on Basic Telecommunications Services. We cannot be certain of how many regional countries may ultimately liberalize their national markets or how quickly change may take place and the effect on our business of future regulatory change cannot be accurately predicted.
Latin American Regulation
The regulatory status of the telecommunications markets in Latin America varies to some degree. All of the countries in which we currently operate are members of the World Trade Organization, and most have committed to some deregulatory measures such as market competition and foreign ownership. Some countries now permit competition for all telecommunications facilities and services, while others allow less competition for some facilities and services, but restrict competition for other services. The telecommunications regulatory regimes of many Latin American countries are in the process of development. Many issues, such as regulation of incumbent providers, interconnection, unbundling of local loops, resale of telecommunications services, pricing, network neutrality and privacy have only been recently addressed, not addressed fully, or even at all. We cannot accurately predict whether and how these issues will be resolved, or their effect on our operations.
Asian Regulation
The status of liberalization of the telecommunications regulatory regimes of the Asian countries in which we operate or may in the future operate varies. Some countries allow full competition in the telecommunications sector, while others limit competition for many or most services. Similarly, some countries in Asia maintain foreign ownership restrictions which limit the amount of foreign direct investment and require foreign companies to seek local joint venture partners. Most of the countries in the region have committed to liberalizing their telecommunications regimes and opening their telecommunications markets to foreign investment as part of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Basic Telecommunications Services. We cannot be certain whether this liberalizing trend will continue or accurately predict the pace and scope of liberalization. It is possible that one or more of the countries in which we operate or may in the future operate will slow or halt the liberalization of its telecommunications markets. The effect on us of such an action cannot be accurately predicted.
The telecommunications regulatory regimes of many Asian countries are in the process of development. Many issues, such as regulation of incumbent providers, interconnection, unbundling of local loops, resale of telecommunications services, offering of voice services and pricing have not been addressed fully or at all. We cannot accurately predict whether or how these issues will be resolved and their effect on our operations in Asia.
 22

Other Regulations
Our networks are subject to numerous local regulations, including codes that regulate our trenching and construction operations or that require us to obtain permits, licenses or franchises to operate. Such regulations vary on a city-by-city, country-by-country and state-by-state basis, and may require us to pay substantial fees. To install our own fiber optic transmission facilities, we typically need to obtain rights-of-way over privately and publicly owned land. Rights-of-way that are not already secured, or which may expire and not be renewed, may not be available to us on economically reasonable or advantageous terms in the future.
Various laws govern our storage, maintenance and use of customer data, including a wide range of data protection, privacy, intellectual property and similar laws. The application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws are often uncertain, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Various legislative or regulatory bodies have recently adopted increasingly restrictive laws or regulations governing the protection or retention of data, and others are contemplating similar actions.
Glossary of Terms
access | Telecommunications services that permit long distance carriers to use local exchange facilities to originate and/or terminate long distance service. 
access charges | The fees paid by long distance carriers to LECs for originating and terminating long distance calls on the LECs’ local networks. 
ATM | Asynchronous transfer mode. An information transfer standard that is one of a general class of packet technologies that relay traffic by way of an address cell. The ATM format can be used by many different information systems, including LANs, to deliver traffic at varying rates, permitting a mix of data, voice and video. 
backbone | A high-speed network that interconnects smaller, independent networks. It is the through‑portion of a transmission network, as opposed to spurs which branch off the through‑portions 
caching | A process by which a Web storage device or cache is located between Web servers (or origin servers) and a user, and watches requests for HTML pages and objects such as images, audio, and video, then saves a copy for itself. If there is another request for the same object, the cache will use its copy, instead of asking the origin server for it again. 
capacity | The information carrying ability of a communications facility. 
carrier | A provider of communications transmission services by fiber, wire or radio. 
CDN | Content Distribution Network or CDN describes a system of computers networked together across the Internet that cooperate transparently to deliver various types of content to end users. The delivery process is optimized generally for either performance or cost. When optimizing for performance, locations that can serve content quickly to the user are chosen. When optimizing for cost, locations that are less expensive to serve from may be chosen instead.
central office | Telephone company facility where subscribers’ lines are joined to switching equipment for connecting other subscribers to each other, locally and long distance. 
CLEC | Competitive Local Exchange Carrier. A company that competes with ILECs in the local services market. 
dark fiber | Fiber optic strands that are not connected to transmission equipment. 
Gateway | Gateways are the primary technical facilities in the markets we serve. They are the endpoints of each long haul city-pair segment. Where we have metro rings, they are the locations most metro rings home to. 
Gbps | Gigabits per second. A transmission rate. One gigabit equals 1.024 billion bits of information. 

 23


ILEC | Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier. A company historically providing local telephone service. Often refers to one of the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). Often referred to as “LEC” (Local Exchange Carrier). 
Interconnection | Interconnection of facilities between or among the networks of carriers, including potential physical colocation of one carrier’s equipment in the other carrier’s premises to facilitate such interconnection. 
ISPs | Internet Service Providers. Companies formed to provide access to the Internet to consumers and business customers via local networks. 
Kbps | Kilobits per second. A transmission rate. One kilobit equals 1,024 bits of information. 
LATA | Local Access and Transport Area. A geographic area composed of contiguous local exchanges, usually but not always within a single state. There are approximately 200 LATAs in the United States. 
LEC | Local Exchange Carrier. A telecommunications company that provides telecommunications services in a geographic area. LECs include both ILECs and CLECs. 
local exchange | A geographic area determined by the appropriate state regulatory authority in which calls generally are transmitted without toll charges to the calling or called party. 
local loop | A circuit that connects an end user to the LEC central office within a LATA. 
long distance carriers | Long distance carriers provide services between local exchanges on an interstate or intrastate basis. A long distance carrier may offer services over its own or another carrier’s facilities. 
MPLS | MultiProtocol Label Switching. A standards approved technology for speeding up network traffic flow and making it easier to manage. MPLS involves setting up a specific path for a given sequence of packets, identified by a label put in each packet, thus saving the time needed for a router or switch to look up the address to the next node to forward the packet to. 
multiplexing | An electronic or optical process that combines a large number of lower speed transmission lines into one high speed line by splitting the total available bandwidth into narrower bands (frequency division), or by allotting a common channel to several different transmitting devices, one at a time in sequence (time division). 
peering | The commercial practice under which ISPs exchange traffic with each other. Although ISPs are free to make a private commercial arrangement, there are generally two types of peering. With a settlement free peering arrangement the ISPs do not need to pay each other for the exchange of traffic. With paid peering, the larger ISP receives payment from the smaller ISP to carry the traffic of that smaller ISP. Peering occurs at both public and private exchange points. 
POP | Point of Presence. Telecommunications facility where a communications provider locates network equipment used to connect customers to its network backbone. 
private line | A dedicated telecommunications connection between end user locations. 
RBOCs | Regional Bell Operating Companies. Originally, the seven local telephone companies established as a result of the divestitures of AT&T in connection with its settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice of an antitrust lawsuit. 
reciprocal compensation | The compensation of a CLEC for termination of a local call by the ILEC on the CLEC’s network, which is the same as the compensation that the CLEC pays the ILEC for termination of local calls on the ILEC’s network. 
resale | Resale by a provider of telecommunications services (such as a LEC) of such services to other providers or carriers on a wholesale or a retail basis. 
router | Equipment placed between networks that relays data to those networks based upon a destination address contained in the data packets being routed. 

 24


SONET | Synchronous Optical Network. An electronics and network architecture for variable bandwidth products which enables transmission of voice, data and video (multimedia) at very high speeds. SONET ring architecture provides for virtually instantaneous restoration of service in the event of a fiber cut or equipment failure by automatically rerouting traffic in the opposite direction around the ring. 
special access services | The lease of private, dedicated telecommunications lines or “circuits” along the network of a local exchange company or a CAP, which lines or circuits run to or from the long distance carrier POPs. Examples of special access services are telecommunications lines running between POPs of a single long distance carrier, from one long distance carrier POP to the POP of another long distance carrier or from an end user to a long distance carrier POP.
streaming | Streaming is the delivery of media, such as movies and live presentations, over a network in real time. A computer (a streaming server) sends the media to another computer (a client computer), which plays the media as it is delivered. 
switch | A device that selects the paths or circuits to be used for transmission of information and establishes a connection. Switching is the process of interconnecting circuits to form a transmission path between users and it also captures information for billing purposes. 
unbundled | Services, programs, software and training sold separately from the hardware. 
unbundled access | Access to unbundled elements of a telecommunications services provider’s network including network facilities, equipment, features, functions and capabilities, at any technically feasible point within such network.
