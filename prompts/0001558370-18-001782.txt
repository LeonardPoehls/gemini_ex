     Item 1.  Business
     The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information included elsewhere in this Report. This description contains forward‑looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ significantly from the projections and results discussed in the forward‑looking statements due to the factors described under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Report. References in this Report to “we,” “our,” “us,” and the “Company” refer to PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (“PFSI”).     Our Company
     We are a specialty financial services firm with a comprehensive mortgage platform and integrated business primarily focused on the production and servicing of U.S. residential mortgage loans (activities which we refer to as mortgage banking) and the management of investments related to the U.S. mortgage market. We believe that our operating capabilities, specialized expertise, access to long-term investment capital, and our management’s experience across all aspects of the mortgage business will allow us to profitably grow these activities and capitalize on other related opportunities as they arise in the future.
     We operate and control all of the business and affairs and consolidate the financial results of Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC (“PennyMac”). PennyMac was founded in 2008 by members of our executive leadership team and two strategic partners, BlackRock Mortgage Ventures, LLC (“BlackRock” or “BlackRock, Inc.”) and HC Partners, LLC, formerly known as Highfields Capital Investments, LLC, together with its affiliates (“Highfields”).
     Our principal mortgage banking subsidiary, PennyMac Loan Services, LLC (“PLS”), is a non-bank producer and servicer of mortgage loans in the United States. PLS is a seller/servicer for the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), each of which is a government‑sponsored entity (“GSE”). PLS is also an approved issuer of securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”), a lender of the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), a lender/servicer of the Veterans Administration (“VA”) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), and a servicer for the Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”). We refer to each of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHA, VA and USDA as an “Agency” and collectively as the “Agencies.” PLS is able to service loans in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and originate loans in 49 states and the District of Columbia, either because PLS is properly licensed in a particular jurisdiction or exempt or otherwise not required to be licensed in that jurisdiction.
     Our investment management subsidiary is PNMAC Capital Management, LLC (“PCM”), a Delaware limited liability company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. PCM manages PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (“PMT”), a mortgage real estate investment trust, listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PMT. PCM also manages PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund, LLC and PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund, LP, both registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”), as amended, an affiliate of these funds and PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund Investors, LLC. We refer to these funds collectively as our “Investment Funds” and, together with PMT, as our “Advised Entities.” During 2017, the Investment Funds sold substantially all of their remaining investments. We expect to liquidate the remaining investments and make final distributions to the Investment Funds’ investors during 2018.
     We conduct our business in three segments: production, servicing (together, production and servicing comprise our mortgage banking activities) and investment management.

· | The production segment performs mortgage loan origination, acquisition and sale activities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The servicing segment performs mortgage loan servicing for both newly originated and loans we service for others, including for the Advised Entities.

      Mortgage Banking
     Loan Production
     In our loan production activities, we earn interest income and gains or losses during the holding period and upon the sale of these loans, and retain the associated MSRs (subject to sharing with PMT cash or a portion of excess servicing spread (“ESS”) with respect to certain consumer direct originated mortgage loans that refinance mortgage loans for which the related MSRs or ESS was held by PMT). Our loan production segment sources mortgage loans through two channels: correspondent production and consumer direct lending.
     In correspondent production we manage, on behalf of PMT and for our own account, the purchase from non-affiliates of newly originated, prime credit quality, first-lien residential mortgage loans that have been underwritten to investor guidelines. PMT acquires, from approved correspondent sellers, newly originated mortgage loans, including both conventional and government-insured or guaranteed residential mortgage loans that qualify for inclusion in securitizations that are guaranteed by the Agencies. For conventional mortgage loans, we perform fulfillment activities for PMT and earn a fulfillment fee for each mortgage loan purchased by PMT. In the case of government insured mortgage loans, we fulfill them for our own account and purchase them from PMT at PMT’s cost plus a sourcing fee. 
     Through our consumer direct lending channel, we originate new prime credit quality, first-lien residential conventional and government-insured or guaranteed mortgage loans on a national basis to allow customers to purchase or refinance their homes. We conduct our own fulfillment for mortgage loans originated through the consumer direct lending channel. Our consumer direct model relies on the Internet and call center-based staff to acquire and interact with

customers across the country. We do not have a “brick and mortar” branch network and have been developing our consumer direct operations with call centers strategically positioned across the United States.

      Loan Servicing
     Our loan servicing segment performs loan administration, collection, and default management activities, including the collection and remittance of loan payments; response to customer inquiries; accounting for principal and interest; holding custodial (impounded) funds for the payment of property taxes and insurance premiums; counseling delinquent mortgagors; and supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. We service mortgage loans both as the owner of MSRs and on behalf of other MSR or mortgage owners. We provide servicing for conventional and government-insured or guaranteed loans (“prime servicing”), as well as servicing for distressed mortgage loans that have been acquired as investments by our Advised Entities (“special servicing”). 
     The UPB of our mortgage loan servicing portfolio is summarized below:

          Investment Management
     We are an investment manager through our subsidiary, PCM. PCM currently manages PMT and the Investment Funds. For these activities, we earn management fees as a percentage of net assets and may earn incentive compensation based on investment performance. During 2017, the Investment Funds sold substantially all of their remaining investments. We expect to liquidate the remaining investment and make final distributions to the Investment Funds’ investors during 2018.

      U.S. Mortgage Market
     The U.S. residential mortgage market is one of the largest financial markets in the world, with approximately $10.6 trillion of outstanding debt and average annual origination volume of $1.7 trillion for the five years ending December 31, 2017. Many of the largest financial institutions, including banks which have traditionally held the majority of the market share in mortgage originations and servicing, have reduced their participation in the mortgage market and the industry remains in a period of significant transformation, creating opportunities for non-bank participants.
     The residential mortgage industry is characterized by high barriers to entry, including the necessity for approvals required to sell loans to and service loans for the Agencies, state licensing requirements for non-federally chartered banks, sophisticated infrastructure, technology, risk management, and processes required for successful operations, and financial capital requirements.
     Our Growth Strategies
     Since our establishment, we have demonstrated our ability to apply our residential mortgage expertise and operating capabilities to multiple business opportunities. In the initial years of our operation, for example, we identified investing in distressed mortgage assets as an attractive opportunity and we raised and deployed capital through a series of successful transactions. As the mortgage market presented opportunities in new loan production and servicing, we expanded our management and capabilities to profitably capitalize on these businesses as well.
     Our growth strategies include:
     Growing our Mortgage Loan Servicing Portfolio
     We expect to grow our servicing portfolio on an organic basis, as our correspondent government‑insured production and consumer direct lending add new prime servicing for owned MSRs, and correspondent conventional production adds new subservicing. In 2017, our correspondent and consumer direct loan production totaled $69.0 billion in UPB. We plan to supplement our organic growth with MSR acquisitions, some of which may be concentrated in delinquent or defaulted loans for which we have expertise in servicing. We have acquired MSRs from large mortgage servicers, which are selling MSRs due to continuing operational and regulatory pressures, higher regulatory capital requirements for banks, and a re-focus on core customers and business, and from independent mortgage banks, which are selling MSRs due to reduced origination volumes, operational losses, and a need for capital. In 2017, we purchased approximately $16.2 billion in UPB of MSRs.     Growing Correspondent Production through Expanding Seller Relationships
     We expect to grow our correspondent production business by expanding the number and types of sellers from which we purchase loans and increasing the volume of loans that we purchase from our sellers as we continue to add to the loan products and services we offer, and deepen our participation in certain geographic markets in the United States. Over the past several years, a number of large banks have exited or reduced the size of their correspondent production businesses, creating an opportunity for non‑bank entities to gain market share. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity based on our management expertise in the correspondent production business, our relationships with correspondent sellers, and our supporting systems and processes.

     Growing Consumer Direct Lending through Portfolio Refinance and Non‑Portfolio Originations
     We expect to grow our consumer direct lending business by leveraging our growing servicing portfolio through refinance and purchase-money loans for existing customers as well as increasing our non‑portfolio originations. As our servicing portfolio grows, we will have a greater number of leads to pursue, which we believe will lead to greater origination activity through our consumer direct business. As of December 31, 2017, we serviced 1.2 million loans for existing customers. At the same time, we are making significant investments in technology, personnel and marketing to increase our non‑portfolio originations. We believe that our national call center model and our technology will enable us to drive origination process efficiencies and best‑in‑class customer service.
     Expansion into new markets
    
We regularly evaluate opportunities to grow our business, including expansion into new markets, such as the broker lending channel and non-delegated correspondent lending services. The broker lending channel involves the underwriting and funding of mortgage loans sourced by mortgage loan brokers and other financial intermediaries. We estimate that the broker lending channel represents approximately 10% of U.S. residential mortgage originations and we have recently entered that market. In 2016, we launched a non-delegated correspondent service to complement our delegated correspondent channel. The non-delegated correspondent lending service involves the purchase by PMT of loans for which PLS has provided underwriting eligibility services to the originating correspondent seller.  Entry into this market leverages our existing loan fulfillment infrastructure, gives our existing sellers an additional method through which they can deliver loans to us and provides us with access to new sellers that were not previously served. 
     Compliance and Regulatory
     Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) was established on July 21, 2010 under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The CFPB is responsible for ensuring consumers are provided with timely and understandable information to make responsible decisions about financial transactions, federal consumer financial laws are enforced and consumers are protected from unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices and from discrimination. Although the CFPB’s actions may improve consumer protection, such actions also have resulted in a meaningful increase in costs to consumers and financial services companies including mortgage originators and servicers.  
     In addition to federal regulation, our loan production and loan servicing operations are regulated at the state level by state licensing authorities and administrative agencies. We, along with certain PennyMac employees who engage in regulated activities, must apply for licensing as a mortgage banker or lender, loan servicer and debt collector pursuant to applicable state law. These state licensing requirements typically require an application process, the payment of fees, background checks and administrative review. Our servicing operations are licensed (or exempt or otherwise not required to be licensed) to service mortgage loans in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our consumer direct lending business is licensed to originate loans in 49 states and the District of Columbia. From time to time, we receive requests from states and Agencies and various investors for records, documents and information regarding our policies, procedures and practices regarding our loan production and loan servicing business activities, and undergo periodic examinations by federal and state regulatory agencies. We incur significant ongoing costs to comply with these licensing and examination requirements.
     Furthermore, the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (the “SAFE Act”) requires all states to enact laws that require all individuals acting in the United States as mortgage loan originators to be individually licensed or registered if they intend to offer mortgage loan products. These licensing requirements include enrollment in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System, application to state regulators for individual licenses and the completion of pre‑licensing education, annual education and the successful completion of both national and state exams.

 In addition, we must comply with a number of federal consumer protection laws, including, among others:
    
· | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), and Regulation X thereunder, which require certain disclosures to mortgagors regarding the costs of mortgage loans, the administration of tax and insurance escrows, the transferring of servicing of mortgage loans, the response to consumer complaints, and payments between lenders and vendors of certain settlement services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), and Regulation Z thereunder, which require certain disclosures to mortgagors regarding the terms of their mortgage loans, notices of sale, assignments or transfers of ownership of mortgage loans, new servicing rules involving payment processing, and adjustable rate mortgage change notices and periodic statements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B thereunder, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of age, race and certain other characteristics, in the extension of credit;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and certain other characteristics;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C thereunder, which require financial institutions to report certain public loan data;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Homeowners Protection Act, which requires the cancellation of private mortgage insurance once certain equity levels are reached, sets disclosure and notification requirements, and requires the return of unearned premiums
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which provides, among other things, interest and foreclosure protections for service members on active duty;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Act and Regulation P thereunder, which require us to maintain privacy with respect to certain consumer data in our possession and to periodically communicate with consumers on privacy matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which regulates the timing and content of debt collection communications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V thereunder, which regulate the use and reporting of information related to the credit history of consumers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, which provides for lenders to require from borrowers or to purchase flood insurance on behalf of borrower/owners of properties in special flood hazard areas.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Many of these laws are further impacted by the SAFE Act and implementation of new rules by the CFPB. 
     Our senior management team has established a comprehensive compliance management system ("CMS") that is designed to ensure compliance with applicable mortgage origination and servicing laws and regulations. The components of our CMS include: (a) oversight by senior management and our Board to ensure that our compliance culture, guidance, and resources are appropriate; (b) a compliance program to ensure that our policies, training and monitoring activities are complete and comprehensive; (c) a complaint management program to ensure that consumer complaints are appropriately addressed and that any required actions are implemented on a timely basis; and (d) independent oversight to ensure that our CMS is functioning as designed.
     An important component of the CMS is management’s Mortgage Regulatory Compliance Committee (“MRCC”).  This committee oversees the CMS and supports our cultural initiatives that reinforce the importance of regulatory compliance.  The Committee also monitors changes in the internal and external environment, approves 

 
  11

 
mortgage compliance policies, monitors compliance with those policies and ensures any required remediation is implemented on a timely basis.  The MRCC has identified individuals throughout the organization to oversee specific areas of compliance. MRCC membership includes senior management from all areas of the Company impacted by mortgage compliance laws and regulations and meets on a regular basis throughout the year.  
     Intellectual Property
     We hold various registered trademarks, including trademarks with respect to the name PennyMac®, the swirl design and rooftop design appearing in certain PennyMac drawings and logos and various additional designs and word marks relating to the PennyMac name. We do not otherwise rely on any copyright, patent or other form of registration to protect our rights in our intellectual property. Our other intellectual property includes proprietary know‑how and technological innovations, such as our proprietary loan‑level analytics systems and models for distressed loan management, and other trade secrets that we have developed to maintain our competitive position.      Competition
     Given the diverse and specialized nature of our businesses, we do not believe we have a direct competitor for the totality of our business. We compete with a number of nationally‑focused companies in each of our businesses.
     In our mortgage banking segments, we compete with large financial institutions and with other independent residential mortgage loan producers and servicers, such as Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Quicken Loans and Nationstar Mortgage. In our loan production segment, we compete on the basis of product offerings, technical knowledge, manufacturing quality, speed of execution, rate and fees. In our servicing segment, we compete on the basis of experience in the residential loan servicing business, quality of high‑touch special servicing and historical servicing performance, and quality of execution, especially in high‑touch special servicing.
     In our investment management segment, we compete for capital with both traditional and alternative investment managers. We compete on the basis of historical track record of risk‑adjusted returns, experience of investment management team, the return profile of prospective investment opportunities and on the level of fees and expenses.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2017, we, through a subsidiary, had 3,189 employees.
