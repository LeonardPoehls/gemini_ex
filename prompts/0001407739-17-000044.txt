ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc. (“DFT”) is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, acquires, develops and operates wholesale data centers. DFT is the sole general partner of, and, as of December 31, 2016, owned 84.9% of the common economic interest in, DuPont Fabros Technology, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership” or “OP”). Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company” or “the Company” refer to DFT and the Operating Partnership, collectively. 
We design and operate innovative, multi-tenant, wholesale data centers, and create solutions with our customers that free them to focus on their core businesses. Our facilities are designed to offer highly specialized, efficient and safe computing environments in a low-cost operating model. Our customers include national and international enterprises across numerous industries, including technology, Internet, content providers, cloud providers, media, communications, healthcare and financial services. Our 11 data centers have a total of 3.3 million gross square feet and 287 megawatts of power available to our customers to operate their servers and computing equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $528.7 million of total revenues, net income of $181.4 million and cash provided by operating activities of $290.0 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had total assets of $3.0 billion. 
Data centers are facilities that house large numbers of computer servers and related equipment and include the infrastructure necessary to operate this equipment, including systems for power distribution, environmental control, fire suppression and security. We believe that our data centers provide sufficient power to meet the needs of the world's largest technology companies. We lease the computer room square feet, or CRSF, and the available power of our facilities to customers under long-term leases. As of January 1, 2017:

• | We had 32 customers with 124 different lease expirations, with only 14.2% of these expirations occurring over the next two years as measured by annualized base rent;


• | The weighted average remaining term of our leases at our operating data centers was 5.4 years; and


• | We served five of the Fortune 25 and 20 of the Fortune 1000, which includes private or foreign enterprises of equivalent size.

Our data centers are strategically located in three major population centers - Northern Virginia, suburban Chicago, Illinois and Santa Clara, California. We have acquired property and have plans to expand into two new markets - the greater Toronto area, and the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. Each of our current and expansion markets has significant electrical power availability and hubs of extensive fiber network connectivity. As of December 31, 2016, we owned the following properties:

• | 11 operating data centers facilities;


• | Five phases of existing data center facilities under development;


• | One shell of a data center currently under development;


• | Two data center facilities with a phase or phases available for future development; and


• | Parcels of land held for future development of four data centers.

We believe that we are well positioned to develop, lease, operate and manage our growing data center portfolio.
We derive substantially all of our revenue from rents received from customers. For most of our customers, and we believe for most potential wholesale data center customers, the amount of available power is the primary factor used to evaluate their data center requirements. Consequently, rents under our leases are based primarily on the amount of power made available to our customers, rather than the amount of space that they occupy. The term “critical load” is used to indicate that portion of each facility's total power capacity that is made available for the exclusive use of its customers to operate their computer servers. Accordingly, throughout this Form 10-K, we discuss our operations in terms of available critical load because it is one of the primary metrics that we use to manage our business. We also provide information relating to each facility's total gross building area and its computer room square feet ("CRSF"), which is the net rentable area of each of our facilities.
We also provide certain technical services to customers as a contractor on a purchase order basis, including layout design and installation of electrical power circuits, data cabling, server cabinets and racks, computer room airflow analyses and monitoring and other services requested by customers.

Market Opportunity
The data center market in North America is highly fragmented with more than 500 companies providing different forms of multi-tenant data center services, although not all data center providers serve the wholesale segment of the data center market. Wholesale data center providers lease large amounts of space, which can range in size from 2,500 to 50,000 square feet or more, and make available large amounts of power, which can range from 250 kilowatts to 10 MW or more, to a limited number of customers. Typically, in wholesale data centers, each customer’s space is segregated with cages or in separate rooms within the data center, commonly referred to as computer rooms or pods. Also, typically, each customer owns and operates its own servers and related computer equipment. This model gives customers the flexibility to design their own server layout and manage the operation of their servers; generally offers greater power within a single data center facility, which provides savings on the cost to operate the data center infrastructure through economies of scale; and provides secure facilities with security and technical staff on-site 24 hours a day, seven days a week to protect and support the critical business processes of the customers operating their servers.
We believe that the growth trends in the data center market, the cloud, Internet traffic and Internet-based services, combined with cost advantages in outsourcing data center requirements, provide attractive growth opportunities for us. The compound annual growth rate of North American data center market revenue from 2015 through 2020 is expected to be approximately 10.9% based on annual forecast data in the Multi-Tenant Datacenter Global Providers 2016 report published by 451 Research in October 2016. We believe that this growth is the result of significant growth of the Internet, cloud and data storage. According to the Cisco Visual Networking Index (VNI) 2015-2020 White Paper, global Internet traffic is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 22%, mobile data traffic is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 53%, and global video traffic is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 31% from 2015 to 2020. 
We believe that companies can realize numerous advantages by outsourcing their data center requirements to wholesale providers, rather than building and operating their own data center facilities. Over our operating history, we have observed that large, wholesale data center facilities offer economies of scale that result in lower operating costs, as compared to the cost to operate smaller facilities. We believe that only companies with very large computing requirements can realize these economies from developing, owning and operating their own data center facilities. We also believe that these advantages in outsourcing data center requirements, combined with the expected growing trends for traffic, provide an opportunity for us to grow our data center portfolio and realize attractive rates of return on the investments in our facilities.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to diversify our customer base and improve our profitability by expanding our geographic presence and supplementing our portfolio with flexible wholesale products. We will continue to serve the wholesale segment of the data center market exclusively. We will capitalize on our exceptional skill in data center design, development and operations as we build-out our development pipeline and maximize cash flow from our existing properties. Specifically, we will expand our geographic presence; diversify our portfolio with flexible wholesale products to meet a variety of power density, redundancy and deployment needs and continue to prudently build-out our development pipeline.
Expand Our Geographic Presence. Our primary focus in the past has been to develop and lease data center space in the three markets in which we operate. Over the next several years, we plan to expand our data center development and operations into several new markets, which we believe will create opportunities to diversify our customer base and increase our profitability. We plan to target two new markets that we believe will satisfy demand of wholesale customers. Initially, we intend to focus our development efforts in the Toronto, Ontario and Portland, Oregon markets, where we believe that there will be strong demand for wholesale data centers even though the development of a wholesale market in these markets is in its infancy. 
In July 2016, we purchased a 46.7 acre parcel of land in the Portland market, and in September 2016, we purchased a shell building and associated land in the Toronto market. The building in Toronto is a former Toronto Star printing facility, and the shell is well-suited for development of our TOR1 data center. We have begun development of Phase IA of TOR1 and expect to deliver this phase later in 2017.
Diversify our portfolio with flexible wholesale products to meet a variety of power density, redundancy and deployment needs. The data center requirements of prospective customers vary greatly between the Internet, cloud and technology industries, on the one hand, and enterprises, on the other. There are three key areas where customer requirements vary:
6


• | Power Density, which is the amount of power available in a fixed amount of space. Many Internet, cloud and technology customers require “high-density” space, or a large amount of power relative to the space, while many enterprise customers require “low density” space, or a smaller amount of power relative to the space. Our more recent data center facility designs (ACC6 Phase II, ACC7, ACC9, CH2, CH3 and SC1 Phase II) provide some flexibility to meet different customers’ density requirements, but we have developed a new design that will enable us to meet a larger variety of density requirements for different customers within a single facility. This new design will be deployed in the Toronto, Ontario and Portland, Oregon markets.


• | Redundancy, which means the number of additional power distribution, cooling units and back-up diesel engine generators included in a facility design to back-up units that are off-line for maintenance or due to a malfunction. Each of our current operating data center facilities are designed with “N+2” redundancy, which means that our facilities include two sets of power distribution systems and back-up diesel engine generators in addition to the number of these sets of units necessary to provide the power contracted by our customers. Our facilities also have this level of redundancy for our mechanical plants, which regulate the environment of the computer rooms leased by our customers. We believe that some customers require N+1 redundancy or less, and that a few customers may require redundancy more robust than N+2. Consequently, we have developed a new data center design that will enable us to meet diverse redundancy requirements of potential customers within a single facility. This new design will be deployed in the Toronto, Ontario and Portland, Oregon markets. Additionally, our CH3 and ACC10 data centers while based on our current design will be developed with N+1 redundancy.


• | Deployment needs, which relates to the time that it takes to construct a phase of a facility and ready it for a customer’s operations. Although we generally commence development of a data center facility prior to having received any commitments from customers to lease any space in the facility - commonly known as developing “on speculation” - we have found that customers often need data center space within very specific, and often short, time frames. Although our current data center development time lines allow for rapid deployment of computer room space, we have completed a new design that we believe will improve our development times and allow us to meet specific customer requirements for available computer room space.

Continue to prudently build-out our development pipeline. We determine when to develop data center properties based on the amount of available space in our operating properties and anticipated demand for data center space in each applicable market. Our development projects as of December 31, 2016 included:

• | ACC9 Phase I - 14.4 MW of available critical load which was 20% pre-leased as of February 23, 2017, with completion expected in the second quarter of 2017;


• | ACC9 Phase II - 14.4 MW of available critical load with completion expected in the third quarter of 2017;


• | SC1 Phase III - 16.0 MW of available critical load which was 100% pre-leased, with completion expected in the third quarter of 2017;


• | TOR1 Phase IA - 6.0 MW of available critical load with completion expected in the third quarter of 2017;


• | CH3 Phase I - 13.6 MW of available critical load with completion expected in the first quarter of 2018; and


• | ACC10 shell is currently in development. Building the shell now will allow us to deliver phases I and II quicker as demand warrants.

The remaining phases of TOR1, comprising 28.5 MW, and the second phase of CH3, comprising 13.6 MW, are being held for future development. We also own parcels of land available to develop four additional data centers, two of which are in the Ashburn, Virginia market and the other two are in the Portland, Oregon market.
Competitive Strengths
We believe that we distinguish ourselves from other data center providers through the following competitive strengths:
Long-term leases to industry-leading customers with strong credit. Our customer base includes leading national and international technology companies. As of January 1, 2017, our two largest customers, Microsoft Corporation and Facebook, Inc., which are currently under long term leases with staggered lease expirations, accounted for 25.4% and 20.2%, respectively, of our annualized base rent. We generally lease space and power to our customers using a “triple net” lease structure, under which our customers occupy all or a percentage of each of our data centers and, in addition to a monthly base rent fee, are obligated to reimburse us for their share of property-level operating expenses. We also have begun to market space and power to customers under a “full service” lease structure, under which both the monthly base rent and a fee for the property-level 
7

operating expenses are fixed, at rates which we believe will cover these operating expenses and will provide us with an adequate return on our investment. We signed twelve triple net leases and two full service leases in 2016. Under all of our leases, customers reimburse us for the cost of the power they use to operate their computer servers and the power that is used to cool their space, and generally provide for annual increases of base rent - either a flat rate of about 2-3% or based on the consumer price index. We believe that these lease structures, together with the economies of scale resulting from the size of our data centers, result in our customers paying less for power and operating expenses over time than they would in a comparable colocation setting, where power costs are often included in the license fee paid to the provider. Most of our leases provide for annual rent increases, and, as of January 1, 2017, our weighted average remaining lease term was approximately 5.4 years.
Data centers strategically located with high power capacity. We own operating facilities and properties available for data center development in the Northern Virginia, suburban Chicago, Illinois and Santa Clara, California markets, each of which is located near sources of abundant and relatively inexpensive power, major population centers and significant fiber optic networks. We believe that these locations help attract and retain customers because access to less expensive power yields significant cost savings for our customers, and the proximity to large population centers enhances performance by reducing latency, which is the time it takes a packet of information to reach the end user. We are expanding into the Toronto, Ontario and Portland, Oregon markets, where we believe that there will be strong demand for wholesale data centers even though the development of a wholesale market there is in its infancy.
Strong development track record and pipeline. We currently own and operate 11 data centers. As of December 31, 2016, eight of these facilities were 100% leased, and 97% of our operating portfolio was leased based on critical load. We believe that our in-house development expertise, together with our relationships with contractors who are experienced in the construction of data centers, gives us a significant advantage over those of our competitors who are required to rely exclusively on third parties to develop, lease and maintain their properties. We currently have undeveloped property or parcels of land suitable for data center development in our Northern Virginia and Portland, Oregon markets.
Properties 
Operating Properties 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we executed 14 leases totaling 50.93 MW of critical load and 267,662 CRSF with a weighted average lease term of 12.2 years. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we extended the terms of eight leases that comprise a total of 7.97 MW of critical load and 54,139 CRSF for a weighted average of 2.3 years. The weighted average base rent, measured on a generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") basis, for all of the leases that have commenced at our operating properties as of December 31, 2016, was $102 per kilowatt per month. This amount excludes operating expenses.

(3) | Annualized base rent represents the monthly contractual base rent (defined as cash base rent before abatements) multiplied by 12 for commenced leases as of January 1, 2017.


(4) | A customer at ACC4 whose lease expires on July 31, 2017 has informed us that they do not intend to renew this lease. This lease is for 1.14 MW and 5,400 CRSF. Additionally, a customer at ACC6, whose lease expires on August 31, 2017, has informed us that they do not intend to renew this lease. This lease is for 0.54 MW and 2,523 CRSF. These leases total 0.9% of Annualized Base Rent. We are marketing these computer rooms for re-lease. 

As of January 1, 2017, our operating property portfolio had 32 data center customers with 124 lease expiration dates. As of January 1, 2017, as described above, we had leases with our largest customer that have 29 lease expiration dates ranging from December 31, 2017 to September 30, 2031, with various renewal rights and, with respect to six lease expiration dates, an option to terminate the lease prior to the expiration date. Also, as discussed above, as of January 1, 2017, we had leases with our second largest customer that have 17 lease expiration dates ranging from June 30, 2018 to February 28, 2023, with various renewal rights and, with respect to its ACC5 lease, an option to decrease the term of the lease of each of nine of its existing computer rooms, provided the aggregate reduction in lease term does not exceed 67 months, or an average of approximately seven months per computer room.
Some leases with certain other customers include options to terminate leases prior to the expiration date. For instance, as of January 1, 2017, we had commenced leases with our third largest customer in three of our data centers with 12 expiration dates ranging from September 30, 2021 to June 30, 2022. This customer has an option to renew the term of each of these lease expiration dates for five years. With respect to six of these lease expiration dates, this customer has the option to make a termination payment and terminate these leases on September 30, 2018. These leases are shown as expiring in 2018 in the Lease Expiration Table above. Also, as of January 1, 2017, we had commenced leases with our fourth largest customer in three of our data centers with nine expiration dates ranging from June 30, 2024 to December 31, 2033. This customer has the option to renew the term of each of these lease expiration dates for five years. With respect to six of its lease expiration dates, this customer has the option to make a termination payment and terminate these leases after ten years of the respective lease terms 
11

with expiration dates ranging from June 30, 2019 to May 31, 2024. These lease expiration dates are shown as expiring after ten years in the Lease Expiration Table above. In addition, as of January 1, 2017, we had commenced leases with our fifth largest customer in four of our data centers with 12 expiration dates ranging from July 31, 2022 to March 31, 2026. This customer has the option to renew the term of two of these lease expiration dates for between one and five years and 10 leases with an option to renew for five years. This customer has an option on ten lease expiration dates to make a termination payment and terminate the lease on dates ranging from March 31, 2018 to June 30, 2022. Two of these leases are shown as expiring March 31, 2018. Certain other customers have similar rights to terminate leases prior to their expiration dates.

Competition 
We believe we have two types of competitors:

• | Owners, operators and developers of both wholesale and colocation data centers, and


• | Companies who choose to build, own and operate their own data centers rather than outsource, some of which are customers of ours.

The data center market in North America is highly fragmented with more than 500 companies providing different forms of multi-tenant data center services. We compete with many of these companies, including other REITs in the data center industry, such as CoreSite Realty Corporation, CyrusOne Inc., Digital Realty Trust Inc., Equinix, Inc. and QTS Realty Trust, Inc. In operating and managing our portfolio, we compete for customers based on factors including location, available critical load, amount of CRSF, flexibility, total cost for the customer and expertise in the design and operation of data centers.
Some companies with very large computing requirements, including some of our customers, such as Microsoft and Facebook, own and operate their own data center facilities for a portion of their computing requirements. These companies may choose in the future to expand their data centers or develop additional data center facilities. Nevertheless, we believe that many of these customers will continue to outsource at least a portion of their data center requirements because of demand for data center space, often within very short time frames, and the expected growing trends in the cloud, Internet traffic and Internet-based services.
We also face competition for the acquisition of land suitable for the development of wholesale data centers from real estate developers in our industry and in other industries. Such competition may have the effect of reducing the number of available properties for acquisition, increasing the price of any acquisition, and reducing the supply of wholesale data center space in the markets we seek to serve.
Regulation 
Environmental Matters 
We are required to obtain a number of permits from various government agencies to construct a data center facility, including the customary zoning, land use and related permits, and permits from state and local environmental regulatory agencies related to the installation of the diesel engine generators that we use for emergency back-up power at our facilities. In addition, various environmental agencies that regulate air quality require that we obtain permits for the operation of our diesel engine generators. These permits set forth specified levels of certain types of emissions permitted from these engines, such as nitrogen oxides. Changes to any applicable regulations, including changes to air quality standards or permitted emissions levels, that are applicable to us, or our ability to obtain the necessary permits to install or operate diesel engines, could delay or preclude our ability to construct or operate data center facilities. 
Under various federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment, a current or former owner, operator or customer of real property may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, wastes or petroleum products on, under, from or in such property. These costs could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. Previous owners of the sites where some of our data center facilities are located (CH1, CH2, and SC1), and the undeveloped land for our ACC8 and ACC11 facilities, used these sites for industrial or retail purposes, and, therefore, each of those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination. In addition, many of our properties presently contain large fuel storage tanks that we use to power our back-up engine generators. If any of these tanks were to release fuel into the environment, we would likely have to pay to clean up the contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at any of our properties may expose us to third-party liability, which could be for amounts that are material, or may materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the contaminated property or to borrow capital using the contaminated property as collateral for the loan. 
Some of our properties may contain asbestos-containing building materials. Environmental laws require that owners or operators of buildings with asbestos-containing building materials properly manage and maintain these materials, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other 
13

abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. In addition, these laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials. 
 Environmental laws and regulations regarding the handling of regulated substances and wastes apply to our properties, in particular regulations regarding the storage of petroleum for emergency/auxiliary power. The properties in our portfolio are also subject to various federal, state and local health and safety requirements, such as state and local fire requirements. If we or our customers fail to comply with these various requirements, we might incur governmental fines or private damage awards. Moreover, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distributions, the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations. We require our customers to comply with these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. Environmental noncompliance liability could also affect a customer's ability to make rental payments to us. 
Although each of our properties has been subjected to Phase I environmental site assessments, they are limited in scope, and may not identify all potential environmental liabilities or risks associated with these properties. Unless required by applicable laws or regulations, we may not further investigate, remedy or ameliorate any liabilities disclosed in the Phase I assessments. 
Americans With Disabilities Act 
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. While we have not conducted a formal audit or investigation of our compliance with the ADA, we believe that our operating properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is ongoing, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect. 
Insurance 
We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio, which includes coverage for riots, terrorism, earthquakes, acts of God and floods. We have policy specifications and insured limits which we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in our opinion, the properties in our portfolio are currently adequately insured. See “Item 1A. - Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Operations - Any losses to our properties that are not covered by insurance, or that exceed our policy coverage limits, would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Some risks to our properties, such as losses due to war, floods and earthquakes, are either not currently insured against or are insured subject to policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 122 employees, with approximately 70% located at our various data centers in Northern Virginia; suburban Chicago, Illinois; Santa Clara, California and the remainder located in Washington, D.C. at our corporate headquarters. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 
Offices 
Our headquarters are located at 401 9th Street NW, Suite 600, Washington, D.C. 20004, and our telephone number is (202) 728-0044. As of December 31, 2016, we leased approximately 22,000 square feet of office space in the building at the address set forth above. We believe our offices are adequate for our current operations.

ITEM 1.A | RISK FACTORS


Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our stockholders. You should carefully consider the following risks in evaluating our company, our properties and our business. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to, among other things, satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders, which in turn could cause our stockholders to lose all or a part of their investment. Some statements in this report including statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this annual report.
Risks Related to Our Business and Operations
We face significant competition, which may decrease or prevent increases in the occupancy and rental rates of our properties.
We compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of technology-related real estate, including CoreSite Realty Corporation, CyrusOne Inc., Digital Realty Trust, Inc., Equinix, Inc. and QTS Realty Trust. Many of these competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, pre-existing relationships with current or potential customers, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and more ready access to capital, all of which allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities. Many of these competitors own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located, or in markets where the cost to operate a data center is less than the cost to operate our data centers. Many of our competitors and new entrants to the data center market are developing additional data center space in the markets that we serve. If the supply of data center space continues to increase as a result of these activities or otherwise, rental rates may be reduced or we may face delays in leasing or be unable to lease our vacant space or new data center space that we develop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. These risks may be exacerbated if new data center developers, owners or operators enter the data center market.
We may be unable to lease vacant or development space or renew leases, or re-lease space as leases expire.
Although as of January 1, 2017, only 6.3 MW of critical load was available for lease and leases that represent less than 2% of critical load power under lease were scheduled to expire in 2017, we expect to complete developments with 50.8 MW of critical power available for lease during 2017, of which 18.9 MW is pre-leased. We may not be able to attract customers for this space or renew these expiring leases with our existing customers, or we may be required to reduce our rental rates or incur costs, if our competitors:

• | offer rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we are offering;


• | offer space that our customers or potential customers perceive to be superior to ours based on numerous factors, including available power, preferred design features, security considerations, location, and connectivity; or


• | offer services that we do not offer and that customers or potential customers desire.

If we are unable to lease available space, or if we are unable to lease available space on a timely basis or at favorable net effective rental rates, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and growth prospects.
Any decrease in the demand for data centers, including a decrease resulting from a downturn in the technology industry or the demand for cloud-based services, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our portfolio of properties consists entirely of wholesale data centers leased primarily to Fortune 1000 Internet, software and other technology-based companies, many of which provide cloud-based services. A decline in the technology industry or the demand for cloud-based services, or the desire of any of these companies to outsource their data center needs, could lead to 
15

a decrease in the demand for space in our data centers, which would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio. We also are susceptible to adverse developments in the industries in which our customers operate, such as decreases in demand for their products or services, business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, costs of complying with government regulations or increased regulation and other factors. We also may be materially adversely affected by any downturns in the market for data centers due to, among other things, oversupply of or reduced demand for space or a slowdown in web-based commerce. Also, a lack of demand for data center space by enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our customers may choose to develop new data centers or expand their own existing data centers, which could result in the loss of one or more key customers or reduce demand for our newly developed data centers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Some of our customers, including Microsoft and Facebook, own and operate their own data center facilities for a portion of their computing requirements, and may choose in the future to expand their data centers or develop additional data center facilities. If any of our key customers were to reduce their reliance on outsourced data center facilities, it could result in a loss of business to us or put pressure on our pricing. If we lose a customer, there is no assurance that we would be able to replace that customer at a competitive rate or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
As of January 1, 2017, our two largest customers, Microsoft and Facebook, accounted for 25.4% and 20.2%, respectively, of our annualized base rent, and the loss of any such customer or any other significant customer, or the inability of any such customer or any other significant customer to pay rent and other expenses as due, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Any of our customers could experience a downturn in their business, which in turn could result in their inability or failure to make timely rental payments pursuant to their leases with us. In the event of any customer default, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. These risks would be particularly significant if one of our four largest customers were to default under their leases. Also, some of our largest customers compete with one another in various aspects of their businesses. The competitive pressures on our customers may have a negative impact on our operations.
In addition, because we have only 33 different customers, the inability of a customer to meet its rent obligations could impact us negatively and significantly. 
In addition, if one or more of our significant customers fail to renew their leases with us, or if any of them exercise any applicable early termination rights, and we are unable to find new customers to utilize the space to be vacated at the same rental rates, then upon the expiration of such leases, as well as the expiration of any future leases, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business.
Any adverse developments in the economic or regulatory environment of our four markets, Northern Virginia; suburban Chicago, Illinois; Santa Clara, California; and Toronto, Ontario, may materially adversely affect our business and operating results.
Our portfolio of operating data center facilities is located in only three markets - Northern Virginia, Chicago, and Santa Clara, California and we plan to open a new data center facility in the Toronto, Ontario metropolitan area later this year. Consequently, we may be exposed to greater economic risks than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse. Also, we may be susceptible to adverse developments in the economic and regulatory environment in any of these markets, including, but not limited to, business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, increases in real estate and other taxes and costs of complying with existing or increased governmental regulation. In addition, other markets in the United States could become more attractive for developers, operators and customers of data center facilities based on favorable costs to construct or operate data center facilities in such other markets. For example, some states have created tax and other incentives for developers and operators to locate data center facilities in their jurisdictions. Any adverse developments in the economy or real estate market in general, or any decrease in demand for data center space resulting from adverse developments in the regulatory or business environment in Northern Virginia, Chicago, Santa Clara, California or Toronto, Ontario could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Our long-term growth depends upon the successful development of our data centers, and unexpected costs or changes in permit requirements or environmental regulations may delay or preclude the construction of additional data centers, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition.
16

For any future data center developments, we will be subject to certain risks that could result in a delay in completion of a project, including, but not limited to, risks related to the acquisition of real property, financing, zoning, environmental and other regulatory approvals, and construction costs. Any delay or denial of a required entitlement or permit, including zoning, land use, environmental, emissions or other related permits would adversely impact our plans for future development. Changes to any applicable regulations, including changes to air quality standards or emissions limitations, could delay or preclude our ability to construct additional data centers or operate our data center facilities, which such delay or preclusion would have a material adverse effect on our growth and future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we intend to develop properties in new geographic regions, such as the Toronto, Ontario and Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas, where we do not possess the same level of familiarity with the development of properties as we do in our existing metropolitan areas, which could adversely affect our ability to develop such properties in a timely manner or at all, or within budgeted costs.
We also will be subject to risks and, potentially, unanticipated costs associated with obtaining access to a sufficient amount of power from local utilities, including costs associated with the development of utility substations on our properties, if applicable, in order to accommodate our power needs, constraints on the amount of electricity that a particular locality's power grid is capable of providing at any given time, and risks associated with the negotiation of long-term power contracts with utility providers. We may not be able to successfully negotiate such contracts on acceptable terms or at all. Any inability to negotiate utility contracts on a timely basis or on acceptable financial terms or upon terms that provide utility power in amounts sufficient to supply the critical load presently anticipated for each of our development properties would have a material adverse effect on our growth, future results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, the selection and acquisition of sites suitable for data center development is a critical factor in our expansion plans. We have limited inventory of facilities with phases available for future development and undeveloped land held for development. There may not be suitable properties available in our markets with the necessary combination of high power capacity and fiber connectivity, or selection of such sites may be limited. For instance, it may not always be possible to locate new data center facilities adjacent to our existing locations, which is our preference. Any inability to acquire additional sites for development, at all or on terms acceptable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our growth, future results of operations and financial condition.
We generally commence development of a data center facility prior to having received any commitments from customers to lease any space in the facility and any extended vacancies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We generally commence development of a data center facility prior to having received any commitments from customers to lease any space in them - commonly known as developing “on speculation” - as, for example, we have done with the development of ACC9, CH3 and TOR1, which currently are under construction. This type of development exposes us to the risk that we will be unable to attract customers on a timely basis, or at all, to the properties that we have developed. This risk may be greater in a market where we have not operated previously, such as Toronto, Ontario, where the first phase of a data center facility is under construction. Once development of a data center facility is complete, we incur certain operating expenses even if there are no customers occupying any space. Consequently, if any of our properties have significant vacancies for an extended period of time, we will incur operating expenses that will not be reimbursed by customers and our results of operations and business and financial condition will be affected adversely, the impact of which could be material.
The loss of access to key third-party technical service providers and suppliers could materially adversely affect our current and any future development projects.
Our success depends, to a significant degree, on having timely access to certain key technical personnel who are in limited supply and considerable demand, such as engineering firms and construction contractors capable of developing our properties, and on having timely access to key suppliers of electrical and mechanical equipment utilized in the design of our data center facilities. For any future wholesale data center development projects, we will continue to rely on these personnel and suppliers. The demand for such technical expertise is intense, and there are a limited number of electrical and mechanical equipment suppliers that design and produce the equipment that we require. We may not always have or retain access to the key service providers and equipment suppliers that we rely on, which could materially adversely affect our current and future development projects.
17

We are dependent upon third-party suppliers for power and diesel fuel for our backup engine generators, and we are vulnerable to service failures of our third-party suppliers and to price increases by such suppliers.
We rely on third parties to provide power to our data centers, and we cannot ensure that these third parties will deliver such power in adequate quantities or on a consistent basis. If the amount of power available to us is inadequate to support requirements of our facilities' infrastructure and our customers' servers and computer equipment, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations to our customers. In addition, the utility companies that provide electricity to our data centers are susceptible to power shortages and planned or unplanned power outages caused by these shortages. If the duration of such an outage were to exceed the time that the fuel stored on-site can power our backup engine generators (as can occur during a severe weather event, such as a hurricane, or other natural disaster), we would be dependent on the regular delivery of diesel fuel to our affected sites. If we are not able to operate any of our data centers with our backup engine generators during an outage, our customers, reputation and business would be harmed.
In addition, we may be subject to risks and unanticipated costs associated with obtaining power from various utility companies. Utilities that serve our data centers may be dependent on, and susceptible to price increases of, a particular type of fuel, such as coal, oil or natural gas. Increases in the cost of power at any of our data centers would put those locations at a competitive disadvantage relative to data centers served by utilities that can provide less expensive power.
We depend on third parties to provide Internet connectivity to the customers in our data centers and any delays or disruptions in connectivity may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our customers require connectivity to the fiber networks of multiple third party telecommunication carriers and we depend upon the presence of telecommunication carriers' fiber networks serving the locations of our data centers in order to attract and retain customers. Any carrier may elect not to offer its services within our data centers, and any carrier that has decided to provide Internet connectivity to our data centers may discontinue the provision of Internet connectivity to our data centers. If carriers were to consolidate or otherwise downsize or terminate connectivity within our data centers, such action could have an adverse effect on the businesses of our customers and, in turn, our own business, financial condition and results of operations.
Each new data center that we develop requires the construction and operation of a sophisticated redundant fiber network. The construction required to connect multiple carrier facilities to our data centers is complex and involves factors outside of our control, including regulatory requirements and the availability of construction resources. If we are not able to establish adequate Internet connectivity to our data centers, such connectivity is materially delayed or is discontinued, or there are significant hardware or fiber failures on this network, our ability to attract and retain new customers or retain existing customers could be impacted negatively, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Failure to abide by applicable service level commitments could subject us to material liability under the terms of our leases, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our leases generally include terms requiring us to meet certain service level commitments primarily in terms of electrical output to, and maintenance of environmental conditions within, the computing rooms leased by customers. Any failure to meet these commitments, including as a result of mechanical failure, power outage, including the inability of utilities that serve our data center facilities to deliver electricity, human error on our part or for other reasons, could subject us to liability under our leases, including the loss of management fee reimbursements or the abatement of rent or, in certain cases of repeated failures, could give the customer a right to terminate the lease. Any such failures also could materially adversely affect our reputation and adversely impact our ability to lease our properties. Each of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may be vulnerable to security breaches which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
A security breach could result in the misappropriation of our proprietary information and cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which in turn could interrupt the operations of our customers. We may be required to expend significant financial resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches. We may not be able to implement security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, loss of existing or potential customers, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
18

Certain of our leases include restrictions on the sale of our properties to certain third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on us, including our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Certain of our leases give the customer a right of first refusal to purchase certain properties if we propose to sell those properties to a third party or prohibit us from selling certain properties to a third party that is a competitor of the customer. The existence of such restrictions could hinder our ability to sell one or more of these properties, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer would have a material adverse impact on us, including our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer as we experienced in 2015 with Net Data Centers would materially adversely affect our business and the income produced by our properties. If any customer becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict the customer solely because of the bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy court might authorize the customer to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against the customer for unpaid future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent owed under the lease. In either case, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. Our business, including our revenue and cash available for distribution to our stockholders, could be materially adversely affected if any of our significant customers were to become bankrupt or insolvent, suffer a downturn in its business, or fail to renew its lease at all or renew on terms less favorable to us than its current terms.
Future consolidation in the technology industry could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition by eliminating some of our potential customers and could make us more dependent on a more limited number of customers.
Mergers or consolidations of technology companies in the future could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, they may discontinue or reduce the use of our data centers in the future. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in customer requirements for data center facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The data center market is characterized by evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements. Some of our customers operate at significant scale across numerous data center facilities and have designed cloud and computing networks with redundancies and fail-over capabilities across these facilities, which enhances the resiliency of their networks and applications. This enhanced resiliency may cause customers to re-evaluate their requirements for an individual data center’s electrical or mechanical infrastructure redundancy. As a result, these customers may realize cost benefits by locating their data center operations in facilities with less redundancy than is found in our existing data center facilities. Additionally, some of our customers have begun to operate their data centers using direct outside air, with a wider range of humidity levels and at temperatures that are higher than servers customarily have operated at in the past, all of which may result in energy cost savings for these customers. We may not be able to operate our existing data centers under these environmental conditions, particularly in multi-tenant facilities with other customers who are not willing to operate under these conditions. If these trends result in changes to the preferences of our large-scale customers, our data center facilities could be at a competitive disadvantage to facilities that satisfy the requirements of these customers. Because we may not be able to modify the redundancy levels or environmental systems of our existing data centers economically, these or other changes in customer requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our operating properties are not suitable for use other than as data centers, which could make it difficult to reposition them if we are not able to lease available space and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our data centers are designed solely to house and run computer servers and related equipment and, therefore, contain extensive electrical and mechanical systems and infrastructure. As a result, they are not suitable for use by customers as anything other than as data centers and major renovations and expenditures would be required in order for us to re-lease vacant space for more traditional uses, or for us to sell a property to a buyer for use other than as a data center.
Declining real estate valuations could result in impairment charges, the determination of which involves a significant amount of judgment on our part. Any impairment charge would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
19

We review our properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Other indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, a sustained significant decrease in the market price of or the cash flows expected to be derived from a property. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining the presence of an indicator of impairment. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of a property, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the property. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows requires a significant amount of judgment regarding assumptions that could differ materially from actual results in future periods, including assumptions regarding estimated remaining life of the data center, future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements. Any impairment charge would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any losses to our properties that are not covered by insurance, or that exceed our policy coverage limits, would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We carry comprehensive liability, fire, earthquake, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio, which includes coverage for riots, terrorism, acts of God and floods that are subject to policy specifications and insured limits. Our insurance policies contain industry standard exclusions and we do not carry insurance for generally uninsurable perils, such as loss from war or nuclear reaction. In addition, some of our policies, like those covering losses due to floods, are subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover potential losses. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged property is subject to recourse indebtedness, such as is the case with respect to ACC3, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged. These events would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We could become subject to liability for failure to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations, including international laws and regulations.
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations regarding the handling of regulated substances and wastes, including, in particular, regulations regarding the storage of petroleum for auxiliary or emergency power. The properties in our portfolio are also subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to: air quality and exhaust emissions; discharges of treated storm water; and health, safety and fire (See “Business - Regulation - Environmental Matters”).
In addition, we are subject to environmental, health and safety laws regulating air emissions, storm water management and other issues arising in our business. Unexpected events, equipment malfunctions and human error, among other factors, can lead to violations of environmental laws, regulations or permits. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations change frequently and may require additional investment to maintain compliance. Noncompliance with existing, or adoption of more stringent, environmental or health and safety laws and regulations or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could be material.
If we or our customers fail to comply with these various requirements, we might incur governmental fines or other sanctions or private damage awards. Moreover, existing requirements could change and future requirements could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export requirements, economic and trade sanctions, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws which also prohibit bribery payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our offerings in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.
We may be adversely affected by laws, regulations or other issues related to climate change.
If we, or other companies with which we do business, particularly utilities that provide our facilities with electricity, become subject to laws or regulations related to climate change, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be impacted adversely. In addition, if our customers adopt programs or policies to increase their utilization of energy 
20

from renewable sources, and the utilities that provide our facilities with electricity cannot satisfy these customers’ requirements for renewable sources of energy, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be impacted adversely.
The federal government and some of the states and localities in which we operate have enacted certain climate change laws and regulations and/or have begun regulating carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions. Although these laws and regulations have not had any known material adverse effects on our business to date, they could limit our ability to develop new facilities or result in substantial compliance costs, retrofit costs and construction costs, including monitoring and reporting costs and capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and other new equipment. Furthermore, our reputation could be negatively affected if we violate climate change laws or regulations.
We cannot predict how future laws and regulations, or future interpretations of current laws and regulations, related to climate change will affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For instance, utilities that serve our data center facilities may be impacted by clean air regulations that have been proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. These regulations, if finalized, would require states to reduce carbon emitted by power generation facilities by specified dates. As a result of these regulations, the cost to generate or procure electricity by any of the utilities that serve our data center facilities could increase significantly. If utilities that provide electricity to our data center facilities cannot generate or procure electricity from renewable sources, at all or at competitive rates, our current and prospective customers may seek to locate their respective data center operations in markets served by utility providers that are able to generate or procure electricity from renewable sources at competitive rates.
Lastly, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in each area in which we operate. These impacts may be caused by changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. The impacts on our operations caused by these changes may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas.
In November 2015, we announced that, over the next several years, we plan to expand our data center development and operations into one or more new markets. As a part of this expansion strategy, we may be developing and operating data centers in markets in which we have little or no operating experience. Our ability to successfully enter new markets will depend on, among other things, our ability to find and acquire land suitable for development, our ability to develop new data centers on our anticipated time-line and at the expected cost, and our ability to lease up newly developed data centers.  Our new markets may have different competitive conditions, and may subject us to different operating considerations, than those we have experienced in our existing markets, which, in turn, may adversely affect our ability to develop and operate data centers in these new markets.
Expansion of our business into new markets will involve substantial planning and allocation of significant company resources and certain risks, including risks related to financing, zoning, regulatory approvals, construction costs and delays. Our lack of operating experience in these new markets may adversely impact our ability to successfully develop new data center facilities in such markets.  In order for our prospective data center development projects in these new markets to be successful, we will be required to carefully select and rely on the experience of one or more general contractors and associated subcontractors during the data center construction process, some of which we may have little or no experience working with. Should a general contractor or significant subcontractor working on any such development project experience financial or other material problems during the construction process, we could experience significant delays, increased costs to complete the project and other issues that may negatively impact our expected financial returns. As we expand into new markets, Site selection in expansion markets is also a factor critical to our expansion plans, and there may not be available, or our lack of operating experience in a new market may make it difficult for us to successfully identify and acquire, suitable properties in these markets in locations that are attractive to our customers and that have access to multiple network providers and a significant supply of electrical power. These and other risks could result in delays to, or increased costs of, completing development projects in new markets or could prevent the completion of development projects in new markets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, expansion into new markets will subject us to risks, including unanticipated costs, associated with obtaining access to a sufficient amount of power from local utilities with whom we have little or no experience, including risks and costs related to the need, in some cases, to develop utility substations on our properties in order to accommodate our power needs; risks related to constraints on the amount of electricity that a particular locality’s power grid is capable of providing at any given time, and risks and costs associated with the negotiation of long-term power contracts with unfamiliar utility providers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully negotiate such contracts on acceptable terms or at all. Any inability to negotiate utility contracts on a timely basis or on acceptable financial terms or in volumes sufficient to supply the requisite 
21

power for our development properties would have a material adverse effect on our growth and results of operations and financial condition.
We generally commence development of a data center facility prior to having received any commitments from customers to lease any space in them - commonly known as developing “on speculation” - and we expect to develop data centers in new markets “on speculation” as well. Due to our lack of operating experience in our new markets, we may be unable to attract customers on a timely basis, or at all, to the properties that we have developed. Once development of a data center facility is complete, we incur certain operating expenses even if there are no customers occupying any space. Consequently, if any of our properties have significant vacancies for an extended period of time, we will incur operating expenses that will not be reimbursed by customers and our results of operations and business and financial condition will be affected adversely, the impact of which could be material.
If we are unable to successfully develop, lease up and operate data centers in new markets, our ability to implement our business strategy and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
As with the development of our other data centers, the development of data centers in new markets is subject to certain risks that could result in a delay in completion or the failure to complete the project, including, but not limited to, risks related to financing, zoning, environmental and other regulatory approvals, and construction costs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop a data center or that we will be able to lease up our data centers once they are developed. If we are unable to successfully develop a data center on the land that we own in Hillsboro, Oregon or the Greater Toronto Area or in any of the other planned expansion markets, our ability to implement our business strategy may be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the markets in which we operate internationally could harm our results of operations. 
We may experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate of the Canadian Dollar relative to the U.S. Dollar. To date, all of our revenues and costs have been denominated in U.S. dollars. With the development of our TOR1 data center facility in the Toronto, Ontario metropolitan area, we will be exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in the Canadian Dollar exchange rate in connection with TOR1-related operations. The majority of the construction costs and operating expenses related to TOR1 will be paid in Canadian Dollars, which could result in these costs and expenses being more than anticipated as a result of declines in the U.S. Dollar relative to the Canadian Dollar. Similarly, we expect that our TOR1 customers will pay rent to us in Canadian Dollars, which could result in these revenues being less than anticipated as a result of increases in the U.S. Dollar relative to the Canadian Dollar. In addition, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates will impact how our international results of operations translate into U.S. Dollars.
Despite using Canadian-denominated debt to hedge portions of our net investment in our Canadian-denominated assets, we likely will not be able to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. In addition, REIT compliance rules may restrict our ability to enter into derivative hedging transactions in the future. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to the Canadian Dollar, our consolidated financial position and results of operations may be negatively impacted as these Canadian Dollar amounts will translate into fewer U.S. Dollars. For additional information on foreign currency risk, refer to our discussion of foreign currency risk in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” included in Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Derivative transactions may limit our gains or result in material losses.
We may use derivatives to hedge our foreign currency or interest rate risks from time to time, although, as of December 31, 2016, we had no derivative transaction in place. Any derivative transactions into which we enter could expose us to certain risks, including:

• | losses on a hedge position reducing the cash available for distribution to stockholders and such losses exceeding the amount invested in such instruments;


• | counterparties to a hedging arrangement defaulting on their obligations;


• | paying certain fees, such as transaction or brokerage fees; and


• | incurring costs if we elect to terminate a hedging agreement early.

The REIT rules impose certain restrictions on our ability to utilize swaps and other types of derivatives to hedge our risks. As a result of these rules, we may have to limit our use of derivative hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous or implement those hedges through a taxable REIT subsidiary. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our taxable REIT subsidiary would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest or 
22

foreign currency rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in our taxable REIT subsidiary will generally not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried back or forward against past or future taxable income in the taxable REIT subsidiary. However, hedges may not be effective in eliminating all of the risks inherent in any particular position. Our profitability may be materially adversely affected during any period as a result of the use of such derivatives.
Our success is dependent on access to qualified personnel. Our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel, or the loss of any of our key personnel, including our executive officers or senior employees, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our success will continue on depend to access to qualified personnel. We must continue to identify, hire, train and retain IT professionals, technical engineers, operations employees, and sales, marketing, finance and senior management personnel who maintain relationships with our customers and who can provide the technical, strategic and marketing skills required for our company to grow. We compete with other companies, including many of our competitors, for the limited pool of talent in these fields. Also, each of our executive officers has an industry reputation that attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential customers and industry personnel. The loss of key employees could hinder our ability to continue to benefit from existing and potential customers. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to retain our current executive officers or key employees. The failure to recruit and retain necessary personnel, including, but not limited to, members of our executive team, could harm our business and our ability to grow our company, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.
If we fail to maintain proper overall business controls, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected or we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, including the accurate and timely reporting of our financial results. In addition, the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could require a restatement of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to, among other things, a decline in the market value of our common stock.
Our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. 
Although a REIT generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders, taxable income varies significantly from year-to-year, and also varies significantly from, and can be significantly less than, net income under GAAP.
Our Board of Directors determines on a quarterly basis the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our REIT taxable income, results of operations, cash flow, capital and liquidity requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures and any stock repurchase program. Consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate from period-to-period.
Risks Related to Our Debt and Preferred and Common Stock Financings
We depend on external sources of capital to fund our growth and refinance existing indebtedness, which capital may not be available to us at all or on terms favorable or acceptable to us.
The cash that we used for the development of data center facilities and the payment of dividends on our preferred and common stock exceeded the cash provided by our operating activities in each year from 2008 through 2016. Our operating activities are not expected to generate sufficient cash to provide the capital necessary for all of our capital requirements including the construction of the ACC9, CH3 and TOR1 data center facilities, and the third phase of the SC1 data center facility, the development of the land that we hold for future data center development, the expansion into new markets and the repayment of our existing indebtedness. In addition, as a REIT, DFT is required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) to distribute at least 90% of its “REIT taxable income,” excluding any net capital gain, to its stockholders annually. Consequently, we rely on third-party sources of capital to fund our development projects and refinance our existing indebtedness. Our access to capital depends, in part, on:

• | general business conditions;


• | financial market conditions;


• | the market's perception of our business prospects and growth potential;


• | our current debt levels;


• | our current and expected earnings and cash flow; and

23


• | the market price of our common stock.

There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing at all or on terms favorable or acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain capital from third parties, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity, which may include curtailing development activity or disposing of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms.
Fluctuations in interest rates could materially affect our financial results.
As of December 31, 2016, $412.2 million of our total consolidated indebtedness (approximately 33% of total consolidated indebtedness) was subject to variable interest rates. We also may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. Because a significant portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense. If the United States Federal Reserve increases short-term interest rates, this would have a significant upward impact on shorter-term interest rates, including the interest rates that our variable rate debt is based upon. Potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and therefore negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, and reduce our access to capital markets.
Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity.
The credit ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt and DFT’s preferred stock are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of our company. Our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur and preferred securities that we may issue. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. In the event our current credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would cause an increase in interest rates under our existing term loans and unsecured line of credit, and may trigger other additional payments or other negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage our debt maturities, our future growth, our financial condition, the market price of our common and preferred stock, and DFT's development and acquisition activity.
We have outstanding indebtedness and preferred stock, which requires that we generate significant cash flow to satisfy the payment and other obligations under the terms of our debt and these securities, and exposes us to the risk of default under the terms of our debt and these securities.
As of December 31, 2016, our total consolidated indebtedness was $1.26 billion, which exceeds the total of our cash on hand at December 31, 2016 and our annual cash flows from operating activities for 2016. Since December 31, 2016, we have incurred an additional $107.1 million of indebtedness, increasing our total indebtedness to $1.37 billion as of the date of this filing. As of December 31, 2016, we also had outstanding $201.3 million of Series C Preferred Stock. We may incur additional debt or issue additional preferred stock for various purposes, including, without limitation, to fund future acquisitions and development activities and operational needs.
The terms of our outstanding indebtedness, as of December 31, 2016, and preferred stock provide for significant interest and dividend payments in 2017, including:

• | $60.6 million of interest on our outstanding indebtedness, based on current interest rates; and


• | $13.3 million of preferred stock dividends.

Our ability to meet these and other ongoing payment obligations of our debt and preferred stock depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. Our ability to generate cash flow, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under our senior notes, our credit agreements and our outstanding preferred stock and to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service these obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets (which we may be limited in doing in light of the relatively illiquid nature of our properties), reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet these payment obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity.
Our outstanding indebtedness, and the limitations imposed on us by the agreements that govern our outstanding indebtedness, and the fixed charge obligations under our outstanding preferred stock, could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:
24


• | make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;


• | limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements, or to carry out other aspects of our business plan;


• | limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or impose refinancing terms that may be less favorable than the terms of the original indebtedness;


• | require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and preferred stock, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements, or adversely affect our ability to meet REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Code;


• | cause us to violate restrictive covenants in the documents that govern our indebtedness, which would entitle our lenders to accelerate our debt obligations;


• | cause us to default on our obligations, causing lenders or mortgagees to foreclose on properties that secure our loans and receive an assignment of our rents and leases;


• | force us to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on unfavorable terms or in violation of certain covenants to which we may be subject; and


• | limit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, thereby limiting our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully.

If any one of these events was to occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
The documents that govern our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in some business activities, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The documents that govern our outstanding indebtedness contain customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on DFT, the Operating Partnership and their respective subsidiaries. These covenants restrict, among other things, the ability of DFT, the Operating Partnership and their respective subsidiaries to:

• | incur debt and liens;


• | enter into sale and leaseback transactions;


• | make certain dividend payments, distributions and investments;


• | enter into transactions with affiliates;


• | enter into agreements limiting the Operating Partnership's ability to make certain transfers and other payments from subsidiaries;


• | sell assets; and


• | merge or consolidate.

In addition, covenants contained in the documents that govern our outstanding indebtedness require the Operating Partnership and/or its subsidiaries to meet certain financial performance tests.
These restrictive operational and financial covenants will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, and limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest, including the ability to make acquisitions or take advantage of other business opportunities that may arise, any of which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects, future operating results and financial condition.
Our failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our outstanding debt (which might also cause cross-defaults with respect to our other debt obligations). For a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Outstanding Indebtedness.”
The documents that govern our outstanding indebtedness require that we maintain certain financial ratios and, if we fail to do so, we would be in default under the applicable debt instrument, which in turn could trigger defaults under our other debt instruments, which could result in the maturities of all of our debt obligations being accelerated and would have a material adverse effect on us, including our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Each of our debt instruments requires that we maintain certain financial ratios. The credit agreement that is secured by our ACC3 data center facility provides that the total indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 60% of the value of the assets of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, determined based on the appraised value 
25

of stabilized data center properties, the amount of unrestricted cash and the book value of development properties and undeveloped land. Under this credit agreement, the administrative agent periodically has the right to have each of our stabilized data center properties appraised. If the total indebtedness of the Operating Partnership exceeds 60% of the applicable asset value, the indebtedness in question would have to be reduced to a level that resulted in compliance with this ratio.
The credit agreements that govern our unsecured term loan and unsecured revolving credit facility each require that we maintain financial ratios relating to the following matters: (i) unsecured debt not exceeding 60% of the value of unencumbered assets; (ii) net operating income generated from unencumbered properties divided by the amount of unsecured debt being not less than 12.5%; (iii) total indebtedness not exceeding 60% of gross asset value; (iv) fixed charge coverage ratio being not less than 1.70 to 1.00; and (v) tangible net worth being not less than $2.3 billion plus 75% of the sum of (x) net equity offering proceeds and (y) the value of equity interests issued in connection with a contribution of assets to the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries.
In addition, the indentures that govern our senior notes require, among other things, that the Operating Partnership and our subsidiaries that guaranty the notes maintain total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of their unsecured debt on a consolidated basis.
If we do not continue to satisfy these covenant ratios, we will be in default under the applicable debt instrument, which in turn would trigger defaults under our other debt instruments, which could result in the maturities of all of our debt obligations being accelerated. These events would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.
The terms of the agreements that govern our indebtedness limit our ability to sell the data center properties that have been pledged as collateral for our indebtedness, which could reduce our liquidity.
One of our income producing data center properties - ACC3 - serves as collateral under an existing credit agreement. This credit agreement limits our ability to sell this property. The indenture that governs our senior notes and the credit agreements that govern our unsecured term loan and unsecured revolving credit facility limit our ability to sell or transfer assets and, under certain circumstances, the indenture requires that we use any net cash proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness. Consequently, our ability to raise capital through the disposition of assets is limited.
Indebtedness secured by our properties exposes us to the possibility of foreclosure, which could result in the loss of the property that secures the indebtedness and any rents to which we would be entitled from leases on that property.
The obligations under one of our credit agreements, with an outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2016 of $111.3 million, is secured by our ACC3 data center facility. A default of any of the obligations under this credit agreement could result in foreclosure actions by our lenders and the loss of the property securing the indebtedness and an assignment to the lenders of our rents and leases related to any such property.
For tax purposes, a foreclosure of any such property would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the underlying indebtedness. If the outstanding balance of this debt exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds from the disposition of the property.
In the future, we may assume or incur additional indebtedness secured by one or more properties that we own or in connection with property acquisitions.
Disruptions in the financial markets may materially and adversely affect our ability to secure additional financing.
The U.S. stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the past, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially, led some lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases cease, to provide credit to businesses and has caused spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. Renewed uncertainty in these markets, or any downturn, could affect our ability to obtain debt financing, or to refinance our debt, at all or on terms favorable or acceptable to us. Such events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock. Our inability to secure additional financing may impede our ability to initiate new development projects. Disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on us, including our business, results of operations and our financial condition.
We may be unable to satisfy our debt obligations upon a change of control of us.
Under the documents that govern our indebtedness, if we experience a change of control, we could be required to repay the entire principal balance of our outstanding indebtedness. Under our senior notes indentures, if we experience a change of control, as defined in the indenture, we must offer to purchase the notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued 
26

interest. Under the credit agreements that govern our term loans and unsecured revolving credit facility, if we experience a change of control, as defined in the applicable credit agreement, we must repay the principal amount of any outstanding loans, plus accrued interest, and, in the case of our unsecured revolving credit facility, the obligation of the lenders to fund any additional loans would terminate. We might not have sufficient funds to repay the amounts due under the term loans or the unsecured revolving credit facility or pay the required price for the notes following a change of control. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition.
Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry
Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and with the real estate industry.
Real estate investments are subject to various risks and fluctuations and cycles in value and demand, many of which are beyond our control. Certain events and conditions may decrease our cash available for distribution, as well as the value of our properties. These events include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | inability to collect rent from customers;


• | vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms, including possible market pressures to offer customers rent abatements, customer improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options;


• | adverse changes in financial conditions of buyers, sellers and customers of properties, including data centers;


• | the attractiveness of our properties to customers;


• | competition from other real estate investors with significant resources and access to capital, including other real estate operating companies, publicly traded REITs and institutional investment funds;


• | reductions in the level of demand or increase in the supply for data center space;


• | inability to acquire land for new data center development;


• | inability to finance development on favorable terms;


• | fluctuations in interest rates, which could adversely affect our ability, or the ability of buyers and customers of properties, including data centers, to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;


• | increases in expenses that are not paid for by or cannot be passed on to our customers;


• | changes to, and enforcement of, laws, regulations and governmental policies, and the costs of compliance therewith;


• | civil unrest, acts of war, terrorist attacks and natural disasters, including earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes and floods, which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses; and


• | the relative illiquidity of real estate investments, especially the specialized real estate properties that we hold and seek to acquire and develop.

Illiquidity of real estate investments and the terms of certain of our leases could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio to raise cash in response to adverse changes in the performance of such properties may be limited and thus could materially adversely affect our financial condition.
In addition, data centers represent an illiquid part of the overall real estate market, due to the relatively small number of potential purchasers of such data centers - including other data center operators and large corporate users - and the relatively high cost per square foot to develop data centers, which limits a potential buyer's ability to purchase a data center property with the intention of redeveloping it for an alternative use, such as an office building, or may substantially reduce the price buyers are willing to pay for the property.
As the present or former owner or operator of real property, we could become subject to liability for environmental contamination, regardless of whether we caused such contamination, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Under various federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances that relate to the protection of the environment, a current or former owner, operator or customer of real property may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, wastes or petroleum products on, under, from or in such property. These costs could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. Previous owners of the sites where some of our data center facilities are located (CH1, CH2 and SC1), and the undeveloped land for our ACC8 and ACC11 facilities, used these sites for industrial or retail purposes. As a result, these properties may contain some level of environmental contamination (See “Business - Regulation - Environmental Matters”). In addition, many 
27

of our properties presently contain large underground fuel storage tanks for emergency power, which are critical to our operations. We likely would be liable for contamination that results from a release of fuel from any of these storage tanks. Moreover, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability, which liabilities may be material, or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the contaminated property or to borrow capital using the contaminated property as collateral for the loan.
As the owner of real property, we could become subject to liability for asbestos-containing building materials in the buildings on our property, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Some of our properties may contain asbestos-containing building materials. Environmental laws require that owners or operators of buildings with asbestos-containing building materials properly manage and maintain these materials, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. In addition, these laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.
Our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other adverse conditions, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation.
When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our customers, employees of our customers and others if property damage or health concerns arise.
We may incur significant costs complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar laws, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Under the ADA, all places of public accommodation must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. A number of additional federal, state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties. We have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance with the ADA. If one of our properties is not in compliance with the ADA, we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance. Additional federal, state and local laws may require modifications to our properties, or restrict our ability to renovate our properties. We cannot predict the ultimate amount of the cost of compliance with the ADA or other laws. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA and any other similar laws, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
We may incur significant costs complying with other regulations, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The properties in our portfolio are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we might incur governmental fines or private damage awards. In addition, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure
Conflicts of interest exist or could arise in the future with holders of units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or OP units, which may impede business decisions that could benefit DFT's stockholders.
Conflicts of interest exist or could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between DFT and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Operating Partnership or any of its partners, on the other. DFT's directors and officers have duties to DFT and its stockholders under applicable Maryland law. At the same time, DFT, as general partner, has fiduciary duties to the Operating Partnership and to its limited partners under Maryland law. DFT's duties as general partner to the Operating Partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of DFT's directors and officers to DFT and its stockholders. The partnership 
28

agreement of the Operating Partnership provides that as long as DFT is the general partner of the Operating Partnership, any conflict that cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either DFT's stockholders or the limited partners will be resolved in favor of DFT's stockholders.
Additionally, the partnership agreement expressly limits DFT's liability by providing that DFT and its officers, directors, agents and employees, will not be liable or accountable to the Operating Partnership for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived if DFT, or such officer, director, agent or employee acted in good faith. In addition, the Operating Partnership is required to indemnify DFT, and its officers, directors, employees, agents and designees to the extent permitted by applicable law from and against any and all claims arising from operations of the Operating Partnership, unless it is established that (1) the act or omission was committed in bad faith, was fraudulent or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (2) the indemnified party received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the indemnified person had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. The provisions of Maryland law that allow the fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict DFT's fiduciary duties that would be in effect were it not for the partnership agreement.
DFT is also subject to the following additional conflicts of interest with holders of OP units:
DFT may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of the employment agreement with Mr. du Pont because of DFT's dependence on him and conflicts of interest. Mr. du Pont entered into an employment agreement with DFT, including clauses prohibiting him from competing with DFT, subject to certain exceptions, in the data center market. This agreement was not negotiated on an arm's length basis. DFT may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, its rights under this employment agreement because of its desire to maintain its ongoing relationship with Mr. du Pont and because of conflicts of interest with him, including allowing him to devote significant time to non-data center projects outside of the Company, to engage in activities that may compete with DFT, or to engage in transactions with DFT without receiving the appropriate board approval.
Tax consequences upon sale or refinancing. Sales of properties, substantially all of our assets and our company, a merger or consolidation of our company, and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of OP units than on DFT's stockholders. The parties that contributed properties to the Operating Partnership may incur tax consequences upon the sale of these properties, substantially all of our assets or our company, a merger or consolidation of our company, and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the tax consequences to DFT and its stockholders. Consequently, these holders of OP units may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such transaction or repayment of debt. Although DFT has exclusive authority as general partner under the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, substantially all of our assets or our company, or enter into a merger or consolidation of our company, any such decision would require the approval of DFT's board of directors, and DFT's ability to take such actions, to the extent that they may reduce the liabilities of the Operating Partnership, may be limited pursuant to the tax protection agreements that DFT entered into upon completion of its initial public offering. Certain of DFT's directors and executive officers could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of its stockholders, including in a manner which could delay or prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.
Mr. du Pont has the right to hold a significant percentage of DFT's stock. DFT's charter generally authorizes its directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve DFT's qualification as a REIT and to limit any person (other than a qualified institutional investor) to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 3.3% of the outstanding shares of its common stock by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive and 3.3% of its outstanding capital stock by value. DFT's board of directors, however, has granted, and in the future may grant, exemptions from the ownership limits described above if such exemptions do not jeopardize its status as a REIT. In addition, DFT's charter provides that Mr. du Pont, certain of his affiliates, family members and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing, may own up to 20.0% of the outstanding shares of DFT's common stock by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, and 20.0% of DFT's outstanding capital stock by value. In addition, pursuant to Mr. du Pont’s employment agreement, if he holds at least 9.8% of our outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis, he will have a contractual right to be nominated to the board of directors. These exemptions and contractual rights could allow Mr. du Pont to exercise a substantial degree of control over DFT's affairs even if he is no longer an executive officer.
Mr. du Pont has significant influence over our affairs. As of December 31, 2016, Mr. du Pont owned an aggregate of approximately 0.2% of DFT's common stock and approximately 25.5% of the OP units (not including those units held by DFT), equal to approximately 4.0% of DFT's common stock, on a fully diluted basis. As a result, he could have influence over our affairs and could exercise such influence in a manner that is not in the best interests of DFT's other stockholders, including by 
29

attempting to delay, defer or prevent a change in control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interests of DFT's stockholders. If he exercises his redemption rights with respect to his OP units and DFT issues common stock in exchange thereof, his influence over our affairs would increase substantially.
DFT's charter and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change in control transaction, even if such a change in control may be in DFT's stockholders' interest, and as a result may depress our stock price.
DFT's charter contains a 3.3% ownership limit. DFT's charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes its directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to ensure DFT's qualification as a REIT and to limit any person (other than a qualified institutional investor or an excepted holder) to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 3.3% of the outstanding shares of its common stock by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, and 3.3% of its outstanding capital stock by value. This ownership limit may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for DFT's common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of its stockholders.
DFT could increase the number of authorized shares of stock and issue stock without stockholder approval. DFT's charter authorizes its board of directors, without stockholder approval, to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock or the number of authorized shares of stock of any class or series, to issue authorized but unissued shares of DFT's common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of its common stock or preferred stock and to set the preferences, rights and other terms of such classified or unclassified shares. DFT's board of directors could establish a series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of such series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for its common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of its stockholders.
Certain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control. Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such shares, including:

• | “business combination” provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an “interested stockholder” (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of our then outstanding voting shares) or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes special appraisal rights and special stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and


• | “control share” provisions that provide that “control shares” of our company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a “control share acquisition” (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of “control shares”) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.

DFT has opted out of these provisions of the MGCL, in the case of the business combination provisions of the MGCL by resolution of its board of directors, and in the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL by a provision in its bylaws. However, DFT's board of directors may by resolution elect to opt in to the business combination provisions of the MGCL and it may, by amendment to its bylaws (which such amendment could be adopted by its board of directors in its sole discretion), opt in to the control share provisions of the MGCL in the future.
The provisions of DFT's charter on removal of directors and the advance notice provisions of its bylaws could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for holders of DFT's common stock or otherwise be in their best interest. Likewise, if DFT's board of directors were to opt in to the business combination provisions of the MGCL, or if the provision in DFT's bylaws opting out of the control share acquisition provisions of the MGCL were rescinded, these provisions could have similar anti-takeover effects. Further, the partnership agreement provides that DFT may not engage in any merger, consolidation or other combination with or into another person, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any reclassification or any recapitalization or change in outstanding shares of our common stock, unless in connection with such transaction DFT obtains the consent of holders of at least 50% of the OP units of the Operating Partnership (not including OP units held by DFT) and/or certain other conditions are met.
Certain provisions in the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership may delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions of us. Provisions in the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership may delay or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions of us or changes in our control. These provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals 
30

involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or change of our control, although some stockholders might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. These provisions include, among others:

• | redemption rights of qualifying parties;


• | transfer restrictions on the OP units;


• | DFT's ability, as general partner, in some cases, to amend the partnership agreement without the consent of the limited partners; and


• | the right of the limited partners to consent to transfers of the general partnership interest and mergers under specified circumstances.

DFT's rights and the rights of its stockholders to take action against its directors and officers are limited.
Maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. As permitted by the MGCL, DFT's charter limits the liability of its directors and officers to DFT and its stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from:

• | actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or


• | a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated.

In addition, DFT's charter authorizes DFT to obligate our company, and DFT's bylaws require DFT, to indemnify its directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, DFT and its stockholders have more limited rights against its directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. Accordingly, in the event that actions taken in good faith by any of our directors or officers impede the performance of our company, stockholders' ability to recover damages from such director or officer will be limited.
Future offerings of debt or equity securities, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation and for the purpose of distributions, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes and classes of preferred stock or common stock. We will be able to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval, unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. As data center acquisition or development opportunities arise from time to time, we may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock to raise the capital necessary to finance these acquisitions or developments or may issue common stock or preferred stock or OP units, which are redeemable for, at our option, cash or our common stock on a one-to-one basis, to acquire such properties. Such issuances could result in dilution of stockholders' equity. Preferred stock and debt, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend or interest payments that could limit our ability to make a distribution to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering or acquisition will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest.
Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT
Failure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock.
We believe that we have qualified as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes and we intend to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT, but we cannot assure shareholders that we will qualify as a REIT. Requirements under the Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a REIT are limited. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the Code is greater in the case of a REIT that, like DFT, holds its assets through a partnership. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect DFT's ability to qualify as a REIT. In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, DFT must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of its assets, the sources of its income and the diversity of its stock ownership. Also, DFT must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its “REIT taxable income,” determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. Furthermore, 
31

any new laws, Treasury regulations, interpretations, or court decisions could change the federal income tax laws or the federal income tax consequences of DFT's qualification and taxation as a REIT. As a result, no assurance can be provided that DFT will continue to qualify as a REIT or that new legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the federal income tax laws with respect to, or the federal income tax consequences of, DFT's qualification and taxation as a REIT. 
If DFT were to lose its REIT status, the tax consequences could reduce its cash available for distribution to its stockholders substantially for each of the years involved because:

• | DFT would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;


• | DFT could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and increased state and local taxes; and


• | Unless DFT is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, DFT could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which it was disqualified.

The additional tax liability to us for the year or years in which DFT does not qualify as a REIT would reduce our net earnings available for investment, debt service or distribution to DFT's stockholders. Furthermore, if DFT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, non-U.S. stockholders that own more than 10% of any class of DFT's shares, who otherwise might not be subject to federal income tax on the sale of DFT's shares, could be subject to federal income tax with respect to any gain on a net basis similar to the taxation of a U.S. stockholder. In addition, if DFT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, DFT would not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to stockholders would be subject to tax as ordinary dividend income to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. As a result of all these factors, DFT's failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could materially adversely affect the value of DFT's stock.
Failure to qualify as a domestically-controlled REIT could subject DFT's non-U.S. stockholders to adverse federal income tax consequences.
DFT will be a domestically-controlled REIT if, at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of its shares of stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders. Because its shares of stock are publicly traded, DFT cannot guarantee that it will, in fact, be a domestically-controlled REIT. If DFT fails to qualify as a domestically-controlled REIT, its non-U.S. stockholders that otherwise would not be subject to federal income tax on the gain attributable to a sale of DFT's shares of stock would be subject to taxation upon such a sale if either (a) the shares of stock were not considered to be “regularly traded” under applicable Treasury regulations on an established securities market, such as the NYSE, or (b) the shares of stock were considered to be “regularly traded” on an established securities market and the selling non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually or constructively, more than 10% in value of the outstanding shares of common stock at any time during specified testing periods. If gain on the sale or exchange of DFT's shares of stock was subject to taxation for these reasons, the non-U.S. stockholder would be subject to federal income tax with respect to any gain on a net basis in a manner similar to the taxation of a taxable U.S. stockholder, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals, and corporate non-U.S. stockholders may be subject to an additional branch profits tax.
If the structural components of our properties were not treated as real property for purposes of the REIT qualification requirements, DFT would fail to qualify as a REIT.
A significant portion of the value of our properties is attributable to structural components related to the provision of electricity, heating ventilation and air conditioning, humidification regulation, security and fire protection, and telecommunication services. We have received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) holding, among other things, that our buildings, including the structural components, constitute real property for purposes of the REIT qualification requirements. We are entitled to rely upon that private letter ruling only to the extent that we did not misstate or omit a material fact in the ruling request we submitted to the IRS and that we operate in the future in accordance with the material facts described in that request. Moreover, the IRS, in its sole discretion, may revoke the private letter ruling. If our structural components are determined not to constitute real property for purposes of the REIT qualification requirements, including as a result of our being unable to rely upon the private letter ruling or the IRS revoking that ruling, DFT would fail to qualify as a REIT, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of DFT's stock.
32

If the Operating Partnership failed to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, DFT would fail to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.
We believe that the Operating Partnership is organized and operated in a manner so as to be treated as a partnership, and not an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation, for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, it is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including DFT, is allocated that partner's share of the Operating Partnership's income. No assurance can be provided, however, that the IRS will not challenge the Operating Partnership's status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, DFT would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, would cease to qualify as a REIT. Also, the failure of the Operating Partnership to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of its cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including DFT.
DFT will be subject to some taxes even if it qualifies as a REIT.
Even if DFT qualifies as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it is subject to some federal, state and local taxes on its income and property. For example, DFT is subject to federal income tax on certain types of income that it does not distribute. In addition, if assessed, DFT would incur a 100% excise tax on transactions with its taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, that are not conducted on an arm's length basis. A TRS is a corporation which is owned, directly or indirectly, by DFT and which, together with DFT, makes an election to be treated as our TRS. In addition, our TRS is subject to federal income tax as a corporation on its taxable income, if any, which consists of the revenues mainly derived from providing technical services, on a contract basis, to our customers. The after-tax net income of our TRS is available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed.
Moreover, if DFT has net income from “prohibited transactions,” that income will be subject to a 100% tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. The determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale.
We will have a reduced carryover tax basis on certain of our assets as a result of the formation transactions, which could reduce our depreciation deductions.
Some of our operating properties have a carryover tax basis that is lower than the fair market value of the property. This position could give rise to lower depreciation deductions on these assets that would have the effect of (1) increasing the distribution requirement imposed on us, which could materially adversely affect our ability to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, and (2) decreasing the extent to which our distributions are treated as tax-free “return of capital” distributions.
Our tax protection agreements could limit our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of certain properties.
In connection with our formation transactions and October 2007 initial public offering, we entered into tax protection agreements with a number of limited partners of the Operating Partnership, including Mr. du Pont and certain of our directors. The agreements provide that, if we dispose of any interest in ACC2, ACC3, ACC4, VA3, VA4 or CH1 in a taxable transaction through the year 2017, we will indemnify these partners for their tax liabilities (in varying amounts, depending on the year in which the disposition occurs) attributable to the built-in gain that exists with respect to such property interest as of the time of our October 2007 initial public offering (and tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reimbursement payment) if those tax liabilities exceed a certain amount. Consequently, although it otherwise may be in our best interest to sell one of these properties, these obligations may make it prohibitive for us to do so. In addition, any such sale must be approved by at least 75% of our disinterested directors. Additionally, the agreement contains various provisions to achieve minimum liability allocations to certain limited partners and indemnifies them for their tax liabilities resulting from any gain or income recognized due to breach of those provisions by the Operating Partnership.
Complying with the REIT requirements may cause us to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.
To qualify as a REIT, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts that we distribute to our shareholders and the ownership of our shares. To meet these tests, we may be required to take or forgo taking actions that we would otherwise consider advantageous. For instance, in order to satisfy the gross income or asset tests applicable to REITs under the Code, we may be required to forgo investments that we otherwise would make. Furthermore, we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio otherwise attractive investments. In addition, we may be required to make distributions to shareholders at disadvantageous times or when 
33

we do not have funds readily available for distribution. These actions could reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our shareholders. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our investment performance.
Changes in taxation of corporate dividends may adversely affect the value of our stock.
The maximum marginal rate of tax payable by domestic noncorporate taxpayers on dividends received from a regular “C” corporation under current federal law is generally lower than the marginal rates at which ordinary income is taxed. The reduced tax rate, however, does not apply to distributions paid to domestic noncorporate taxpayers by a REIT on its stock, subject to certain exceptions. The earnings of a REIT that are distributed to its stockholders generally remain subject to less federal income taxation than earnings of a non-REIT “C” corporation that are distributed to its stockholders net of corporate-level income tax. However, the lower rate of taxation on dividends paid by regular “C” corporations could cause domestic noncorporate investors to view the stock of regular “C” corporations as more attractive relative to the stock of a REIT, because the dividends from regular “C” corporations continue to be taxed at a lower rate while distributions from REITs (subject to certain exceptions) are generally taxed at the same rate as other ordinary income for domestic noncorporate taxpayers.
There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to REITs. 
The IRS, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, regulations and other guidance. Legislative and regulatory changes, including comprehensive tax reform, may be more likely in the 115th Congress, which convened in January 2017, because the Presidency and both Houses of Congress will be controlled by the same political party. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.
