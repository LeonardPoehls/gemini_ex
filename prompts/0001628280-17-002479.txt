ITEM 1. | Business

General
We focus on providing cleaner, lower carbon intensity products and services. We are North America's largest producer of advanced biofuels. We utilize a nationwide production, distribution and logistics system as part of an integrated value chain model designed to convert natural fats, oils and greases into advanced biofuels. During 2016, we sold 567 million gallons and 
1

had revenues of $2.0 billion. We are also engaged in research and development efforts focused on the conversion of diverse feedstocks into renewable chemicals.
We own and operate a network of 14 biorefineries. Twelve biorefineries are located in the United States and two in Germany, and 13 of which produce biodiesel or renewable hydrocarbon diesel and have an aggregate nameplate production capacity of 502 million gallons per year, or mmgy. We also operate one microbial fermentation facility in connection with our development of renewable chemicals and one feedstock processing facility. We believe our fully integrated approach, which includes acquiring feedstock, managing biorefinery facility construction and upgrades, operating biorefineries, and distributing through a network of terminals, positions us to serve the market for biomass-based diesel and other advanced biofuels along with other products and services. 
We are a lower-cost biomass-based diesel producer. We primarily produce our biomass-based diesel from a wide variety of lower cost feedstocks, including inedible corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat. We also produce biomass-based diesel from virgin vegetable oils, which are more widely available and tend to be higher in price. We believe our ability to process a wide variety of feedstocks provides us with a cost advantage over many biomass-based diesel producers, particularly those that rely primarily on higher cost virgin vegetable oils, such as soybean oil or canola oil.
We are in the process of developing renewable chemicals through our development-stage industrial biotechnology business, REG Life Sciences, which uses proprietary microbial fermentation processes to produce renewable chemicals, fuels and other products. Fatty acids are one of three product areas REG Life Sciences has focused on, along with esters and alcohols.
We sell petroleum-based heating oil and diesel fuel, which enables us to offer additional biofuel blends, while expanding our customer base. We sell heating oil and ultra-low sulfur diesel, or ULSD, at terminals throughout the northeastern U.S. as well as BioHeatÂ® blended fuel at one of our existing Northeastern terminal locations. We expanded our sales of additional biofuel blends to Midwest terminal locations and look to potentially expand to other areas across North America. 
We acquired a 75 mmgy nameplate capacity renewable hydrocarbon diesel biorefinery located in Geismar, Louisiana in June 2014. We began production at the Geismar facility in October 2014 after our completion of certain upgrades. The facility was idle from April 2015 to March 2016 while repairs were made related to the two separate fires that occurred at the facility in April and September 2015. Our Geismar facility has been running at high run rates since early October 2016.
We also expanded our business internationally by acquiring a majority interest in Petrotec AG ("Petrotec"), in December 2014. During 2015 and 2016, we acquired additional shares in Petrotec through cash tender offers and purchases on the open market. At December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 91% of Petrotec's outstanding shares. In January 2017, we completed the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in Petrotec and now own 100% of its outstanding shares. Petrotec is a fully-integrated company utilizing used cooking oil and other waste feedstocks to produce biomass-based diesel at its two biorefineries in Emden and Oeding, Germany.  Our production capacity in Europe is approximately 50 mmgy. 
In August 2015, we acquired our Grays Harbor facility, a 100 mmgy nameplate biodiesel plant and terminal at the Port of Grays Harbor, Washington. This acquisition expanded our production fleet to the west coast of the United States. The Grays Harbor location includes 18 million gallons of storage capacity and a terminal that can accommodate feedstock intake and fuel delivery on deep-water PANAMAX class vessels as well as possessing significant rail and truck transport capabilities. To date, the production facility's primary feedstock has been canola oil sourced nearby in the Pacific Northwest. 
In March 2016, we acquired our 20 mmgy nameplate biodiesel refinery located in DeForest, Wisconsin, REG Madison, LLC, which produces biodiesel from yellow grease, rendered animal fats, and inedible corn oil, in addition to refined vegetable oils using our patented technology currently in use at our Seneca, Illinois plant. The facility has both truck and rail capabilities.

In addition to the production facilities and fermentation facility listed above, we maintain a testing laboratory at our corporate headquarters in Ames, Iowa, which allows us to test various feedstocks for conversion into biomass-based diesel, as well as various manufacturing processes available in the production of biomass-based diesel. We also have a regional office in Tulsa, Oklahoma, focused on maintaining and developing advanced biofuel technologies and renewable chemicals. Our industrial biotechnology research and development activities, conducted in South San Francisco, are dedicated to the development of renewable chemicals, advanced biofuels and other products using our proprietary microbial fermentation technology. 
Our Feedstocks and Other Inputs
Our ability to use a wide range of feedstocks gives us the flexibility to respond to changes in feedstock pricing to maintain our feedstock cost advantage. We have the ability to change our processing techniques to accommodate different feedstocks and feedstock mixes. In 2016, approximately 72% of our total feedstock usage was lower cost inedible corn oil, used cooking oil or rendered animal fat feedstock and the remaining 28% was from refined vegetable oils, such as soybean oil or canola oil. 
We procure our feedstocks from numerous vendors in quantities ranging from truckload to railcar to water vessel to pipeline. There is no established futures market for lower cost feedstocks. Inedible corn oil is typically purchased in nearby forward positions of one to three months, and occasionally longer, on fixed priced contracts. We generally purchase used cooking oil and rendered animal fats on one to four week forward positions using fixed pricing or an indexed price compared to a published index such as USDA reports or recognized industry price reports such as The Jacobsen or Informa. Soybean and canola oils can be purchased on a spot or forward contract basis from a number of suppliers and pricing for these vegetable oils is compared to the broadly traded Soybean Oil Index of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).
From time to time, we work with developers of next generation feedstocks, such as algae and camelina, to assist them in bringing these new feedstocks to market. We have converted several of these feedstocks, as well as other second generation feedstocks, into high quality biomass-based diesel in our laboratory and production facilities. We believe we are well positioned to incorporate many new feedstocks into our production process as they become commercially available.
We procure methanol, chemical catalysts used in our production process such as sodium methylate and hydrochloric acid, under fixed-price contracts and formula-indexed contracts based upon competitive bidding. These procurement contracts typically last from three months to one year. The price of methanol is indexed to the monthly reported published price such as the JJ&A Methanol report or Southern Chemical (SSC) report.
Distribution
We have established a national distribution system to supply biomass-based diesel throughout the United States. Each of our biomass-based diesel facilities is equipped with an on-site rail loading system, a truck loading system, or both. Our Seneca biorefinery near the Illinois River has direct barge access supplying customers using the inland waterways system. Our Houston biorefinery has barge and deep-water ship loading capability. Our Grays Harbor biorefinery has deep-water capability for PANAMAX class vessels. We also manage some customersâ biomass-based diesel storage tanks and replenishment process. We lease 484 railcars for transportation and lease biomass-based diesel storage tanks in 49 terminals as of December 31, 2016. In general, the terminals where we lease our biomass-based diesel storage tanks are petroleum fuel terminals so that fuel distributors and other biomass-based diesel customers can create a biomass-based diesel blend at the terminal before further distribution. Terminal leases typically have one- to three-year terms and are generally renewable subject to certain terms and conditions. During 2016, we have sold our various products in 47 states, four provinces in Canada, Peru, as well as Europe.

Risk Management
The prices for feedstocks and biomass-based diesel can be volatile and are not always closely correlated. Lower cost feedstocks are particularly difficult to risk manage given that such feedstocks are not traded in any public futures market. To manage feedstock and biomass-based diesel price risks, we utilize forward contracting, hedging and other risk management strategies, including the use of futures, swaps, options and over-the-counter products.
In establishing our risk management strategies, we draw from our own in-house risk management expertise and we consult with industry experts. We utilize research conducted by outside firms to provide additional market information and risk management strategies. We believe combining these sources of knowledge, experience and expertise gives us a more sophisticated and global view of the fluctuating commodity markets for raw materials and energy, which we then can incorporate into our risk management strategies.
Seasonality
Biodiesel producers have experienced seasonal fluctuations in demand for biodiesel. Biodiesel demand has tended to be lower during winter in most states due to blending concentrations being reduced. To mitigate some of these seasonable fluctuations in demand, we have upgraded our Newton and Danville biorefineries to produce distilled biodiesel from lower cost feedstocks, thus allowing that product to have improved cold-weather performance. 
Renewable Identification Number, or RIN, prices may also be subject to seasonal fluctuations. The RIN is dated for the calendar year in which it is generated. Since 20% of an Obligated Party's annual Renewable Volume Obligation, or RVO, can be satisfied by prior year RINs, most RINs must come from biofuel produced or imported during the RVO year. As a result, RIN prices can be expected to increase as the calendar year progresses if the RIN market is undersupplied compared to that year's RVO and decrease if it is oversupplied. For further discussion and background on RINs, see "Government Programs Favoring Biomass-based Diesel Production and Use" below.
Competition
We face competition from producers and suppliers of petroleum-based diesel fuel, from other biomass-based diesel producers, marketers, traders and distributors. The size of the biomass-based diesel industry is small compared to the size of the petroleum-based diesel fuel industry and large petroleum companies have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitive differentiators are product quality, both biomass-based diesel and RIN quality, supply reliability and price. We also face competition in the biomass-based diesel RIN compliance market from producers of renewable hydrocarbon diesel and in the advanced biofuel RIN compliance market from producers of other advanced biofuels. In the United States and Canadian biomass-based diesel markets, we compete with large, multi-product companies that have greater resources than we do. Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill Incorporated, Louis Dreyfus Commodities Group and Ag Processing Inc. are major international agribusiness corporations and biodiesel producers with the financial sourcing and marketing resources to be formidable competitors in the biodiesel industry. These agribusiness competitors tend to make biodiesel from higher cost virgin vegetable oils such as soybean or canola oil, which they produce as part of their integrated agribusinesses. We are also in competition with producers of renewable hydrocarbon diesel, such as Neste Oil, which has approximately 882 million gallons of renewable hydrocarbon diesel production capacity in Asia and Europe and Diamond Green Diesel, LLC, the joint venture between Valero Energy Corp. and Darling International with approximately 160 million gallons of production capacity and plans to grow its capacity to 275 million gallons by end of 2017. Renewable hydrocarbon diesel can also satisfy the RFS2 biomass-based diesel requirement if the renewable hydrocarbon diesel meets the greenhouse gas reduction requirements and may satisfy Canadian renewable fuel requirements. Neste Oil has greater financial resources than we do. 
In the RFS2 advanced biofuel market, we also compete with other producers and importers of advanced biofuels, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol producers and producers of biogas used in transportation. We face increasing competition from imported biomass-based diesel and expect this to continue. In January 2015, the EPA announced the approval of a plan submitted by CARBIO, a consortium of Argentinean renewable fuel producers, which allows for Argentinian biodiesel made from soybean oil to generate RINs. Imported biomass-based diesel that does not qualify under RFS2, also competes in jurisdictions where there are biomass-based diesel blending requirements.
We also face competition from independent biodiesel producers. Most of these competitors own only one biodiesel plant and thus, do not enjoy the benefits of scale that we do. Many of these competitors own biodiesel plants that can process only higher cost virgin vegetable oils. Furthermore, in our marketing and distribution, we face competition from biomass-based diesel traders such as US Oil, NGL, Noble, Shell, Tenaska, Vitol and others. These trading companies may have greater financial resources than we do and are able to take significant biomass-based diesel positions in the marketplace. These competitors are often customers and/or suppliers of ours as well.
Segment and Geographic Information
5

We re-assess our reportable segments on an annual basis. Prior to 2015, our business was organized into two reportable segments - the Biomass-based Diesel segment and the Services segment. As a result of the increased activities surrounding our renewable chemicals business, in 2015 we began reporting a new segment, Renewable Chemicals, which was previously included in the Biomass-based Diesel segment. Financial and geographic information regarding our segments can be found in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Government Programs Favoring Biomass-Based Diesel Production and Use
The biomass-based diesel industry benefits from numerous federal and state government programs, the most important of which is RFS2.
Renewable Fuel Standard
On July 1, 2010, RFS2âs biomass-based diesel requirement became effective, requiring for the first time that a certain percentage of the diesel fuel consumed in the United States be made from renewable sources. The biomass-based diesel requirement can be satisfied by two primary fuels, biodiesel and renewable hydrocarbon diesel. RFS2 required the use of one billion gallons of biomass-based diesel in 2012, required 1.28 billion gallons in 2013 and at least one billion gallons each year thereafter, with such higher amounts to be determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, subject to the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, approval. On November 30, 2015, the EPA issued the final 2014 through 2016 RVO rules whereby the biomass-based diesel volumes were set at 1.63 billion, 1.73 billion, 1.90 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In November 2016, the EPA issued the final 2017 biomass-based diesel volume at 2 billion gallons and additionally set the 2018 target at 2.1 billion gallons.
The biomass-based diesel requirement is one of four separate renewable fuel requirements under RFS2. The RFS2 requirements are based on two primary categories and two subcategories. The two primary categories are conventional renewable fuel, which is primarily satisfied by corn ethanol, and advanced biofuel, which is defined as a biofuel that reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared to the petroleum-based fuel the biofuel is replacing. The advanced biofuel category has two subcategories, cellulosic biofuel, to be satisfied by newly developed cellulosic biofuels, such as ethanol made from woody biomass, and biomass-based diesel, which is satisfied by biodiesel and renewable hydrocarbon diesel, or RHD. RFS2âs total advanced biofuel requirement is larger than the combined cellulosic fuel and biomass-based diesel requirements, thus requiring the use of additional volumes of advanced biofuels.
The RFS2 requirement for advanced biofuels can be satisfied by any advanced biofuel, including biodiesel, renewable hydrocarbon diesel, biogas used in transportation, biobutanol, cellulosic ethanol or sugarcane-based ethanol, so long as it meets the 50% greenhouse gas reduction requirement. The advanced biofuel requirement was 2.88 billion gallons in 2015, 3.61 billion gallons in 2016, and 4.28 billion gallons in 2017.
The advanced biofuel RVO is expressed in terms of ethanol equivalent volumes, or EEV, which is based on the fuelâs renewable energy content compared to ethanol. Biodiesel has an EEV of 1.5 and RHD has an EEV of 1.5-1.7, compared to 1.0 for sugarcane-based ethanol. Accordingly, it requires less biomass-based diesel than sugarcane-based ethanol to meet the required volumes as each gallon of biomass-based diesel counts as more gallons for purposes of fulfilling the advanced biofuel RVO, providing an incentive for Obligated Parties to purchase biomass-based diesel to meet their advanced biofuel RVO.
The RFS2 volume requirements apply to petroleum refiners and petroleum fuel importers in the 48 contiguous states and Hawaii, who are defined as âObligated Partiesâ in the RFS2 regulations, and requires these Obligated Parties to incorporate into their petroleum-based fuel a certain percentage of renewable fuel or purchase credits in the form of RINs from those who do. An Obligated Partyâs RVO is based on the volume of petroleum-based fuel they produce or import. The largest United States petroleum refining companies, such as Valero, Phillips 66, ExxonMobil, British Petroleum, Chevron and Shell, represent the majority of the total RVO, with the remainder made up of smaller refiners and importers.
Renewable Identification Numbers
The EPA created the renewable identification number, or RIN, system to track renewable fuel production and compliance with the renewable fuel standard. EPA registered producers of renewable fuel may generate RINs for each gallon of renewable fuel they produce. In the case of biomass-based diesel, generally 1.5 to 1.7 biomass-based diesel RINs may be generated for each gallon of biomass-based diesel produced, based upon the fuel's renewable energy content. Renewable fuel, including biomass-based diesel, can then be sold with associated RINs attached. RINs may also be separated from the gallons of renewable fuel they represent and once separated they may be sold as a separate commodity. RINs are ultimately used by Obligated Parties to demonstrate compliance with the RFS2. Obligated Parties must obtain and retire the required number of RINs to satisfy their RVO during a particular compliance period. An Obligated Party can obtain RINs by buying renewable fuels with RINs attached, buying RINs that have been separated, or producing renewable fuels themselves. All RIN activity under RFS2 must be entered 
6

into the EPAâs moderated transaction system, which tracks RIN generation, transfer and retirement. RINs are retired when used for compliance with the RFS2 requirements.
The value of RINs is significant to the price of biomass-based diesel. In 2015, RIN prices as a percentage contribution to the average B100 spot price, as reported by OPIS fluctuated significantly throughout the year and range from a low of $0.58 per gallon, or 23%, in September to a high of $1.55 per gallon, or 53%, in January. In 2016, RIN prices as a percentage contribution to the average B100 spot price, as reported by OPIS fluctuated significantly throughout the year and range from a low of $1.05 per gallon, or 37%, in September to a high of $1.89 per gallon, or 54%, in January.
Biodiesel Tax Credit
The federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit, or BTC, when in effect, provides a $1.00 per gallon excise tax credit to the first blender of biomass-based diesel with at least 0.1% petroleum-based diesel fuel. The BTC can then be credited against such biodiesel federal excise tax liability or the blender can obtain a cash refund from the United States Treasury for the value of the credit. The BTC became effective January 1, 2005 and then lapsed January 1, 2010 before being reinstated retroactively on December 17, 2010. The BTC again lapsed as of December 31, 2011 and on January 2, 2013, it was again reinstated, retroactively for 2012 and through December 31, 2013. The BTC lapsed again on December 31, 2013 and was retroactively reinstated for 2014 on December 19, 2014. On December 18, 2015, the BTC was reinstated for 2015 and was in effect until December 31, 2016. The BTC is best thought of as an incentive shared across the entire value chain through routine, daily trading and negotiation.  The BTC lapsed again on January 1, 2017, but is generally expected to return even though timing and form of the incentive, if reinstated, are uncertain.  
California Low Carbon Fuel Standard Credits
The California Low Carbon Fuel Standard, or LCFS, regulation is a rule designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels used in California. The regulation quantifies lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by assigning a âcarbon intensityâ (CI) score to each transportation fuel based on that fuelâs lifecycle assessment. Each fuel provider (generally the fuelâs producer or importer, or âregulated partyâ) is required to ensure that the overall CI score for its fuel pool meets the annual carbon intensity target for a given year. A regulated partyâs fuel pool can include gasoline, diesel, and their blendstocks and substitutes. In other words, excess CI reductions from one type of fuel (e.g. diesel) can be used to offset insufficient reductions in another fuel (e.g. gasoline).
We get CI credits when we sell qualified biomass-based diesel into California. CI credits ranged from $56 per metric ton to $129 per metric ton in 2016. 
Other State Programs
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 40 states have implemented various programs that encourage the use of biomass-based diesel through blending requirements as well as various tax incentives. For example, Illinois offers an exemption from the generally applicable 6.25% sales tax on fuel for biomass-based diesel blends that incentivizes blending at 11% biomass-based diesel, or B11, through December 31, 2018. Illinoisâ program has made that state one of the largest biomass-based diesel markets in the country. Since 2006, Iowa has had in place a retailerâs incentive for blended fuel which has been modified over time. For 2013 through 2017, retailers earn $0.045 per gallon of B5. Iowa also has a biomass-based diesel production incentive that provides $0.02 per gallon of production capped after the first 25 million gallons per production plant. Iowa recently enacted an increase in its excise tax on fuel, which is three cents per gallon less for B11 or higher blends than the diesel fuel tax. In Texas, the biomass-based diesel portion of biomass-based diesel blends are exempt from state excise tax, which results in a $0.20 per gallon incentive for B100.
Currently, Minnesota law requires a B5 biodiesel blend throughout the entire year. In 2014, the law required the state to increase blends to a B10 blend in the summer months. Oregon has implemented a B5 biodiesel blend requirement. New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Washington have all adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends beginning at B2 (and B5 in New Mexico) with incremental increases, provided certain feedstock or production minimums are met. Several northeast states, including Connecticut and Vermont, have adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends in home heating oil. In October 2016, the City of New York has adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends at a 5% rate for heating oil starting on October 1, 2017 and the blend level then moves to 10% in 2025, 15% in 2030 and 20% in 2034. In addition, Oregon and Washington State have been in the process of developing and implementing their own low carbon fuel programs. Oregon is currently engaged in the rulemaking process. 
Although we believe that state requirements for the use of biofuels increase demand for our biomass-based diesel within such states, they may not increase overall demand in excess of RFS2 requirements. Rather, existing demand for our biofuel from 
7

Obligated Parties in connection with federal requirements may shift to states that have use requirements or tax incentive programs.
Environmental Matters
Our manufacturing facilities, like other fuel and chemical production facilities, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground; the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; ecological and natural resources; and the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the public. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with numerous environmental permits to construct and operate each facility. They can require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to human health and the environment. A violation of these laws, regulations or permit conditions could result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and or facility shutdowns. We do not currently have any environmental proceedings either pending or threatened against our facilities that would materially affect our business or financial condition. Furthermore, we do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements as presently in effect.
History

Research and development
We devote considerable resources to our research and development programs. Our biomass-based diesel research and development programs have been primarily targeted towards improving the quality and efficiency of the biomass-based diesel production process and developing applications for co-products. Our development stage industrial biotechnology business conducts research and development involving the production of renewable chemicals, additional advanced biofuels and other products from our proprietary microbial fermentation process. In January 2016, ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company and REG Life Sciences commenced a joint development collaboration to develop technology to produce biodiesel by fermenting renewable cellulosic sugars from sources such as agricultural waste. In October 2016, the Company delivered its first commercial product, a specialty fatty acid. REG developed, produced and delivered approximately one metric ton of the renewable, multi-functional chemical to Aroma Chemical Services International, a leading specialty manufacturer and supplier of flavor and fragrance ingredients. Fatty acids are one of three product areas REG Life Sciences has focused on, along with esters and alcohols.
We expect our research and development expense to decrease in future periods as the business unit generates collaboration revenue. In November 2016, we commenced a strategic review of the life sciences business. We incurred research and development expense of $18.2 million, $16.9 million, and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
