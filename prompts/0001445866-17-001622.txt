Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceedings
 The Company and our Chapter 11 Subsidiaries received bankruptcy court confirmation of the dismissal on June 15, 2016, and subsequently emerged from bankruptcy. The DIP funding, discussed above, allowed the Company to survive the time during bankruptcy and at the end of the bankruptcy turned over any remaining funds to the attorneys and the trust. The only funds available for the future administrative costs were prepaid insurance funds from which we received a refund on June 08, 2016 of $44,926 and on August 22, 2016 received $4,135. The Company upon emergence resorted to selling equity for cash so as to proceed on reviving the Company. Currently we have no continuing commitment from any party to provide necessary additional working capital, or if one

becomes available, there is no certainty that its terms will be favorable or acceptable to the Company to continue its current business plan. 
 Competitive Business Conditions 
 Many companies are engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and mining of mineral properties. We are at a disadvantage with respect to those competitors whose technical staff and financial resources exceed our own. Although the Company survived the bankruptcy with no assets or cash, we decided to start increasing stock value by using equity funding to acquire claims and restart our business. 
Government Regulations and Permits
 In connection with mining, milling and exploration activities, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including laws and regulations relating to protection of air and water quality, hazardous waste management and mine reclamation as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species. 
 Reclamation
We generally will be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts would be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. As soon as we have a mining operation, we will be required to arrange and pledge certificates of deposits for reclamation with the state regulatory agencies. At this time no reclamation cost are calculated or carried forward. 
 Government Regulation
Our mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States, and the State of New Mexico, which govern mining, milling, prospecting, development, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, and waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. There are no current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. 
 Environmental Regulation
All future projects are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. Our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we will operate could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects. 
 Employees
 As of June 30, 2016, we had two employees. In addition, we use consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of our project evaluation, business plan, due diligence and corporate governance. 
Office Facilities
