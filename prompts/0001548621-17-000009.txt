Item 1.    Business. 
General 
As used in this report, NPC Restaurant Holdings, LLC is referred to herein as “Holdings.” Holdings and its subsidiaries are referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our.” Holdings’ wholly-owned subsidiary, NPC International, Inc. is referred to as “NPC.” NPC’s wholly-owned subsidiary, NPC Quality Burgers, Inc., is referred to herein as “NPCQB.”
NPC was founded in 1962 and is the largest franchisee of any restaurant concept in the United States (U.S.), based on unit count, according to the 2016 “Top 200 Restaurant Franchisees” by the Restaurant Finance Monitor and is the seventh largest restaurant unit operator, based on unit count, in the U.S. NPC is a Kansas corporation incorporated in 1974 under the name Southeast Pizza Huts, Inc. In 1984, its name was changed to National Pizza Company, and it was subsequently renamed NPC International, Inc. on July 12, 1994. 
Our Pizza Hut operations. We are the largest Pizza Hut franchisee and as of December 27, 2016 we operated 1,226 Pizza Hut units in 27 states with significant presence in the Midwest, South and Southeast. As of December 27, 2016, our Pizza Hut operations represented approximately 20% of both the domestic Pizza Hut restaurant system and the domestic Pizza Hut franchised restaurant system as measured by number of units, excluding licensed units which operate with a limited menu and no delivery. 
Our Wendy’s operations. As of December 27, 2016 we operated 184 Wendy’s units in 5 states.We expect to continue to expand our Wendy’s operations through opportunistic acquisitions of restaurants in additional markets and through organic growth with development of new restaurants that meet our investment objectives. All of our Wendy’s restaurants are owned and operated by NPCQB and are primarily located in and around the Salt Lake City, Greensboro-Winston Salem, Raleigh-Durham and Kansas City metropolitan areas.
Overview 
Our Pizza Hut restaurants are diversely located, ranging from metro to “small-towns” which have populations of 20,000 or less. Approximately 30% of our restaurants are located in small-towns. Our size and scale provides significant operating efficiencies and geographic and market diversity within certain regions of the country. Additionally, we are an operationally driven company that is focused on running efficient restaurants while providing high levels of customer service and quality food at attractive values. 
Our Pizza Hut restaurants are open seven days a week and serve both lunch and dinner. Pizza Hut restaurants generally provide carry-out and delivery, and are the only national pizza chain to offer full table service. We operate our Pizza Hut restaurants through three different formats to cater to the needs of our customers in each respective market. Delivery units, or “Delcos,” are typically located in strip centers and provide delivery and carry-out. Red Roof units, or “RRs,” are traditional free-standing, dine-in restaurants which offer on-location dining room service as well as carry-out service, and are principally located in small-towns. Restaurant-Based Delivery units, or “RBDs,” conduct delivery, dine-in, and carry-out operations from the same location. In 
3

response to evolving consumer needs and preferences and the restaurant marketplace, we are migrating most of our dine-in restaurants to the Delco format over the next seven to ten years.
Our Wendy’s restaurants are open seven days a week and serve both lunch and dinner with certain locations serving breakfast. Our Wendy’s units are generally free-standing restaurants and include a pick-up window in addition to a dining room with counter service.

(1) | In computing these averages, total net product sales for the fiscal periods were divided by “equivalent units” which represents the number of units open at the beginning of a given period, adjusted for units opened, closed, acquired or sold during the period on a weighted average basis. Equivalent units were 1,234 for fiscal 2016 and 1,262 in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014.


(2) | In computing these averages, total net product sales for these fiscal periods were divided by equivalent units for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 of 161, 142 and 116, respectively. 

Digital ordering is becoming increasingly important to our Pizza Hut customers, with approximately 44% of our Pizza Hut delivery and carry-out sales processed digitally for fiscal 2016 compared to approximately 41% in fiscal 2015 and 34% in fiscal 2014. In the future, we expect to see continued growth in digital ordering. Our digital orders are processed by a third-party vendor.
We operate two call centers that primarily process overflow delivery and carry-out orders for approximately 1,000 of our Pizza Hut units. In addition, these call centers process orders in certain metro markets that are placed via a specific dedicated Pizza Hut phone number that serves select markets. Approximately 10% of our Pizza Hut delivery and carry-out sales were processed by our customer service representatives in these call centers during both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. 
We treat our Pizza Hut operations and Wendy’s operations as separate operating segments, and we aggregate the operating segments into one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.
Pizza Hut, Inc. 
PHI is the world’s largest pizza quick service restaurant, or “QSR,” company. The Pizza Hut brand had over 7,600 restaurants and delivery units in the United States and over 8,700 international units in more than 100 other countries and territories, including licensed units as of fiscal 2016. Since the first Pizza Hut restaurant was opened in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas, the Pizza Hut brand has become one of the most recognized brands in the restaurant industry.

PHI is owned and operated by Yum!. Yum! has over 43,500 units (including licensed units) in more than 135 countries and territories. In addition to Pizza Hut, Yum! also owns the restaurant brands Taco Bell and KFC. Yum! has global scale capabilities in marketing, advertising, purchasing and research and development, and invests significant time working with the franchise community on all aspects of the business, ranging from new products to new equipment to new management techniques. 
Wendy’s
Wendy’s is the world’s third largest quick-service restaurant company in the hamburger sandwich segment. The Wendy's system included approximately 6,500 franchise and Company-operated restaurants in the United States and 30 countries and U.S. territories worldwide as of fiscal 2016.
The Wendy’s Company is the parent company of its 100% owned subsidiary holding company Wendy’s Restaurants, LLC. Wendy’s Restaurants, LLC is the parent company of Wendy’s International, LLC. Wendy’s International, LLC is the indirect parent company of Quality Is Our Recipe, LLC (“Wendy’s”), which is the owner and franchisor of the Wendy’s® restaurant system in the United States.
Our Products 
Pizza Hut
Pizza Hut restaurants generally provide carry-out and/or delivery, full table service and a menu featuring pizza, pasta, chicken wings, salads, soft drinks and, in some restaurants, sandwiches and beer. Pizza sales account for approximately 74% of our net product sales. Sales of alcoholic beverages are less than 1% of our net product sales.
All product ingredients are of a high quality and are prepared in accordance with proprietary formulas established by PHI. We offer a variety of pizzas in multiple sizes with a variety of crust styles and different toppings. With the exception of food served at the lunch buffet, food products are prepared at the time of order. We also offer the WingStreet product line that includes bone-in and bone-out fried chicken wings. 
New product innovations are vital to the continued success of any restaurant and PHI maintains a research and development department which develops new products and recipes, tests new procedures and equipment and approves suppliers for Pizza Hut products. All new products are developed by PHI and franchisees are prohibited from offering any other products in their restaurants unless approved by PHI. 
Wendy’s
Wendy’s restaurants offer an extensive menu specializing in hamburger and chicken sandwiches, which are prepared to order with the customer’s choice of condiments. The Wendy’s menu also includes chicken nuggets, chili, french fries, baked potatoes, freshly prepared salads, soft drinks, Frosty® desserts, kids’ meals and other limited time offered products. Hamburger and chicken sandwiches accounted for approximately 45% of our Wendy’s net product sales.
Business Growth Strategy 
An important part of our business growth strategy is to deliver upon the fundamentals of restaurant operational excellence and customer service in our existing markets in order to grow our market share year over year. We intend to augment this basic strategy with (i) opportunistic acquisitions of Wendy’s restaurants, (ii) relocating, remodeling or rebuilding existing assets to better serve our customers, (iii) the development of new Pizza Hut Delco locations and Wendy’s units within our existing territories as justified by the number of currently unserviced trade areas and other relevant demographics and (iv) other acquisition opportunities in the restaurant industry.
Franchise Agreements 
Pizza Hut
On January 1, 2003, we began operating under new franchise agreements with PHI, pursuant to two types of agreements: territory franchise agreements (“TFA’s”) and location franchise agreements (“LFA’s”). TFA’s govern the franchise relationship between PHI and us with respect to a specific geographical territory, while LFA’s govern the franchise relationship between PHI and us with respect to specified restaurants. Additionally, these agreements require us to be a member of the International Pizza Hut Franchise Holder’s Association (“IPHFHA”), an independent association of substantially all Pizza Hut franchisees. 
We operate approximately half of our units under LFA’s, with the remaining units operating under TFA’s. 
5

Territory franchise agreements. Our TFA’s provide us with the exclusive right to develop and operate Pizza Hut restaurants and delivery units within a defined geographic territory, such as a county. We also have the right to develop additional Pizza Hut restaurants and delivery units within our franchise territory. If we fail to develop a franchise territory or provide adequate delivery service as required under our franchise agreements, PHI would have the right to operate or franchise Pizza Hut restaurants in that area; however, this has not occurred to date. As of December 27, 2016, we had no commitments for future development under any TFA. Pursuant to our TFA’s, we are required to pay a royalty rate of 4.0% of RBD and RR sales and 4.5% of Delco sales, as defined in the franchise agreements. Effective January 1, 2020, for approximately 28% of our Delco’s which currently operate under our existing TFA’s, the royalty rates are scheduled to increase from 4.50% to 4.75% and, effective January 1, 2030, these rates will increase to 5.0%. 
Location franchise agreements. Our LFA’s provide us with the right to operate a Pizza Hut restaurant at a specific location. Pursuant to our LFA’s, we are required to pay a royalty rate of 4.0% to 6.5% of sales, which varies by concept, as defined in the franchise agreements. For dine-in restaurants or “Dine-ins,” which are typically free-standing restaurants which offer on-location dining room service and include both RR and RBD units, PHI may not develop or franchise a new Dine-in in a geographical circle centered on the restaurant containing 15,000 households and with a radius of at least one mile and no more than ten miles. For Delcos, as long as we provide adequate delivery service to our delivery area, PHI may not provide or license delivery service to any point within the delivery area. If PHI identifies an opportunity to open a new restaurant, within a Site Specific Market (no Territorial franchisees and no PHI-owned units), and we operate the closest Pizza Hut restaurant, PHI must first offer the new opening opportunity to us. 
Other terms of franchise agreements. The TFA’s are effective until December 31, 2032 and contain perpetual 20-year renewal terms subject to certain criteria. The LFA’s are also effective until December 31, 2032 at which time we may renew them at our option for a 20-year term. Pursuant to our franchise agreements, PHI must approve our opening of any new restaurant and the closing of any of our existing restaurants. In addition, the franchise agreements contain restrictions on our ability to raise equity capital and require approval to effect a change of control. PHI has a right of first refusal to acquire existing Pizza Hut restaurants which we may seek to acquire. The franchise agreements also govern the operation of their respective franchises with respect to issues such as restaurant upkeep, advertising, purchase of equipment, the use of Pizza Hut trademarks and trade secrets, training and assistance, advertising, the purchase of supplies, books and records and employee relations. If we fail to comply with PHI’s standards of operations, PHI has various rights, including the right to terminate the applicable franchise agreement, redefine the franchise territory or terminate our right to establish additional restaurants in a territory. The franchise agreements may also be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company. At no time during our history has PHI sought to terminate any of our franchise agreements, redefine our territories or otherwise limit our franchise rights. 
Franchise agreement asset upgrade requirements. The 2003 TFA and LFA franchise agreements allow PHI to require a remodel on up to 15% of our assets annually beginning in 2016. On April 12, 2016, we entered into an Amended Franchise Agreement with Pizza Hut, Inc. which sets forth the terms of the Asset Partner Plan. The Asset Partner Plan governs our future Pizza Hut asset upgrade requirements, including remodel scope and timing of such actions, and supersedes the previous agreements relating to such upgrade requirements. The scope of the remodel requirements under the Asset Partner Plan vary based upon (i) the asset type, (ii) the date of the last asset action and (iii) in some cases population density. The Asset Partner Plan requires each qualifying franchisee in the system to remodel or rebuild 10% of its asset base annually through 2025; thereafter executing a minor remodel ten years after completing a major remodel and a major remodel seven years after completing a minor remodel on a continual cycle moving forward. We are relocating most of our Dine-in assets to the more cost efficient Delco format in lieu of the Dine-in remodel option to ensure a more contemporary store base that better meets the needs of consumers in the markets we serve. Additionally, the Delco format requires significantly less annual maintenance costs and generally has higher margins. All assets constructed before 1980 will be required to be sunset no later than 2036. In the event we do not follow the Asset Partner Plan or determine at a later time not to participate in the plan, PHI could require that we remodel or rebuild up to 15% of our assets annually in accordance with our franchise agreements. We expect to meet our 2016 obligations under the APP.
Going Forward Franchise Agreements. PHI franchise agreements governing acquisitions completed after 2003 are referred to by PHI as Going Forward Franchise Agreements (“GFFA’s”). The various agreements are all LFA’s, expire on December 31, 2032 and contain a 20-year renewal term subject to certain criteria. 
The 2006 LFA was executed in conjunction with our acquisition in October 2006 of 39 units from PHI in and around Nashville. 
Between December 2008 and February 2009, the Company acquired 294 units under the 2008 LFA which was amended effective with the acquisition of the units primarily as follows:

• | Kansas City. This agreement for 51 units was amended to be substantially similar (including royalty rates) to the 2003 TFA. 

6


• | Florida, Georgia, Iowa, and St. Louis. These agreements were amended to be substantially similar to the 2006 LFA executed in the Nashville acquisition for the 138 units acquired in Florida, Georgia, and Iowa as a part of the December 9, 2008 acquisition and for the 50 units acquired in St. Louis as a part of the February 17, 2009 acquisition. 


• | Denver. Two agreements for 55 units were executed as part of the January 20, 2009 acquisition. For 25 units in the market, an agreement was amended to be substantially similar to the 2006 LFA executed in the Nashville acquisition. We are required to pay a royalty rate of 6.0% of sales for all asset types during the original term of the agreement. The agreement for the remaining 30 units was amended to be substantially similar to the 2003 TFA, paying a royalty rate between 4.0%-4.6% of sales for all asset types. 

The 2012 LFA was executed in conjunction with our acquisition in February 2012 of 36 units from PHI in and around Jacksonville, Florida. We are required to pay a royalty rate of 6.0% of sales for all asset types during the original term of the agreement. 
Estimated costs to complete the asset upgrade requirements noted above under the Asset Partner Plan are included in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and the Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements table included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
WingStreet agreement. Effective December 25, 2007, the Company entered into a new agreement (the “WingStreet agreement”) with PHI that terminated its prior WingStreet franchise agreement addendum, which the Company had operated under since December 16, 2005. This agreement identifies the WingStreet concept as a Pizza Hut product line or menu extension that is to be incorporated under the Company’s existing franchise agreements with PHI. The royalty rate paid on WingStreet sales is the same as Pizza Hut product sales. The WingStreet agreement provides that the maximum royalty fee to be charged to a Delco unit that incorporates the WingStreet product line should not exceed 6.25% of sales, as defined in the franchise agreements. This rate was a reduction from the existing royalty rate of 6.5% that was being paid on certain units operating under our LFA’s. 
Development Incentives. For fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2014, PHI offered development incentives totaling $80,000 per new unit developed (“Development Incentives”), subject to certain threshold criteria. Additionally, PHI offered development incentives totaling $10,000 per unit converted to the WingStreet platform for fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2015 (“WingStreet Incentives”). These incentives were recorded as a reduction to other restaurant operating expenses in the year the qualifying asset was opened or the conversion completed.
Our blended average royalty rate for Pizza Hut units (excluding Development Incentives and WingStreet Incentives) as a percentage of total sales was 4.9% for fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016. 
Wendy’s
On July 22, 2013, we began operating under franchise agreements with Wendy’s that are for specific locations. Each franchise agreement begins at the date of the acquisition or new store opening and continues for the length of the underlying lease or 20 years, whichever is shorter. Each agreement also has one 10 year renewal, subject to certain conditions. The royalty rate we are required to pay is 4.0% of gross sales, as defined in the franchise agreements, subject to certain incentives. Our blended average royalty rate for Wendy’s units as a percentage of total sales was 3.8% for fiscal 2016 and 3.9% for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. 
Other Terms of Franchise Agreements. Pursuant to our Wendy’s franchise agreements, Wendy’s must approve our opening of any new restaurant and the closing of any of our existing restaurants. For acquisitions of Wendy’s restaurants owned by other franchisees, Wendy’s has a right of first refusal to acquire the existing units. 
The agreements govern the operation of Wendy's respective franchises with respect to such issues as restaurant maintenance, advertising, purchase of supplies, food specifications and standards, inspections and use of Wendy’s proprietary marks and trade secrets as well as timely completion of Image Activation (“IA”) activities, (defined as a reimage or refresh). If we fail to substantially comply with the standards or procedures set forth in the franchise agreement, Wendy’s may terminate the franchise agreement. The franchise agreements may also be terminated upon other events, including our bankruptcy or insolvency. At no time during our history has Wendy’s sought to terminate any of our franchise agreements or otherwise limit our franchise rights.
Franchise agreement asset development and upgrade requirements. Our franchise agreements require us to perform facility upgrades to all of our restaurants. Estimated costs to complete the asset upgrade requirements are included in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and the Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements table included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion 
7

and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We were in full compliance with the upgrade requirements defined in the franchise agreements as of December 27, 2016.
The franchise agreement requirements relating to each acquisition of Wendy’s restaurants by NPCQB are as follows:

• | Kansas City. In connection with the acquisition, NPCQB agreed to complete 12 IA’s on existing restaurants by December 31, 2018. NPCQB also entered into a development agreement with Wendy’s whereby NPCQB has the right to develop five units to be opened by December 31, 2018. NPCQB had the option to close up to four specified restaurants by December 31, 2016, of which one was closed.


• | Salt Lake City. NPCQB agreed to complete 15 IA’s by December 31, 2018. NPCQB entered into a development agreement with Wendy’s, whereby NPCQB has the right to develop five units to be opened by December 31, 2018, of which two units have been opened as of December 27, 2016. Additionally, in connection with the acquisition, NPCQB has the option to close up to seven specified restaurants by December 31, 2017, of which NPCQB has closed three units as of December 27, 2016. 


• | Greensboro-Winston Salem. In connection with the acquisition in July 2014, NPCQB also agreed to complete 21 IA’s by December 31, 2021. NPCQB also has the option to close up to 12 specified restaurants by June 30, 2019 of which two units have been closed as of December 27, 2016. 


• | Raleigh. NPCQB agreed to complete nine IA’s and 15 additional restaurants in its other existing markets by December 31, 2020. NPCQB also entered into a development agreement with Wendy’s, whereby NPCQB has the right to develop nine units to be opened by December 31, 2021. 

Based on the requirements of the Wendy’s franchise agreements noted above, we were required to complete 22 IA’s at December 27, 2016 of which we have completed 33. Including the benefit of acquired IA stores and new stores developed, approximately 47% of our Wendy’s restaurants had been image activated as of December 27, 2016.  This pace is well ahead of the 60% image activation by 2020 requirement established by Wendy’s.  
Promotion and Advertising 
Pizza Hut
We spend on average 6% of net product sales from our Pizza Hut units on local and national Pizza Hut advertising activities. IPHFHA requires its members to pay dues, which are spent primarily for national advertising and promotion. Dues are 2.5% of gross sales, as defined in the franchise agreements from our Pizza Hut units. AdCom, a joint advertising committee, consisting of representatives from PHI and IPHFHA, directs the national advertising campaign. PHI is not a member of IPHFHA, but has agreed to make contributions with respect to those restaurants it owns on a per-restaurant basis to AdCom at the same rate as its franchisees. 
In addition, each Pizza Hut restaurant is required pursuant to franchise agreements to contribute dues of 1.75% of gross sales, as defined in the franchise agreements, to advertising cooperatives (“advertising co-op’s”). The advertising co-op’s control the advertising within designated marketing areas (“DMA’s”). All advertisements must be approved by PHI. 
Effective in 2015 and continuing through 2017, the advertising co-ops have agreed to transfer amounts equal to 1.75% of member gross sales from local advertising to AdCom for national advertising, bringing the total national advertising budget to 4.25%. 
Additionally, effective in 2012 and continuing through 2017, the IPHFHA established a digital technology fund (“DigiCo”) whereby members remit $0.10 per online order to the DigiCo.  The contributions are used to develop digital technology for the benefit of the Pizza Hut System. The digital marketing fund is administered by the DigiCo board which consists of three members from PHI and two members of the franchise community.  
The remainder of our total advertising expenditures were utilized within our discretion for local print marketing, including coupon distribution as well as telephone directory advertising, digital marketing, point of purchase materials, local store marketing and sponsorships. 
Wendy’s
We spend on average 4% of total net sales from our Wendy’s units on local and national Wendy’s advertising activities. We are required under our franchise agreements to contribute to the national advertising fund and for local and regional advertising 
8

programs governed by the Wendy’s Unit Franchise Agreement. Beginning in 2014, the rate is 3.50% of total net sales for national advertising and 0.50% for local and regional advertising. 
Supplies and Distribution
Pizza Hut
We purchase substantially all equipment, supplies and food products required in the operation of our Pizza Hut restaurants from suppliers who have been quality assurance approved and audited by PHI. Purchasing is substantially provided by Restaurant Supply Chain Solutions, LLC (“RSCS”), a cooperative set up to act as a central procurement service for the operators of Yum! franchises. 
We rely upon one distributor to provide most of our food and other supplies. Under our direction, our distributor will purchase all products under terms negotiated by RSCS or another cooperative designated by us. If the product is not available through an RSCS agreement, then our distributor may purchase from another Yum! approved source. Our restaurants take delivery of food supplies one to two times a week. 
Wendy’s
Wendy’s entered into a purchasing co-op relationship agreement with its franchisees to establish Quality Supply Chain Co-op, Inc. (“QSCC”). QSCC manages, for the Wendy’s system in the United States and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, operating supplies and equipment under national contracts with pricing based upon total system volume. All QSCC members (including the Wendy’s Company) pay sourcing fees to third party vendors on products which are sourced through the QSCC. 
We rely upon two primary distributors to provide most of our food and other supplies for our Wendy’s restaurants. All products must be purchased by a Wendy’s approved source. Our restaurants take delivery of food and supplies two to three times a week.
Information Technology 
We have developed a proprietary web-based business intelligence software tool that provides critical operating data on a timely basis to our restaurant teams to assist them in operating efficiently while meeting the needs of customers. Product sales and most expenses are captured through our back office system and transferred directly to our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system for accurate and timely reporting. Our back office system provides support for inventory, payroll, accounts payable, cash management, and management reporting functions. All corporate computer systems, including laptops, restaurant computers, call centers, and administrative support systems are connected using a wide-area network. This network supports an internal web site, or “Portal,” for daily administrative functions, allowing us to eliminate paperwork from many functions and accelerate response time. 
Pizza Hut
Our Pizza Hut restaurants utilize a proprietary point-of-sale, or “POS,” cash register system. The POS system provides effective communication between the kitchen and the server, allowing employees to serve customers in a quick and consistent manner while maintaining a high level of control. The system also helps dispatch and monitor delivery activities in the store. The POS system is fully integrated with order entry systems in our call centers, as well as Pizza Hut’s digital provider. In our Delco and RBD units, the POS system includes a kitchen management system, which automatically displays recipes, preparation and cooking instructions for all food items. 
Wendy’s
Our Wendy’s restaurants have an Aloha POS cash register system. The POS system provides effective communication between the kitchen and the server, allowing employees to serve customers in a quick and consistent manner while maintaining a high level of control. In all units, the POS system includes a kitchen monitor system, which automatically displays customer orders allowing cooks to prepare orders in the order they were received.  
Product sales and inventory are captured through the back office system and transferred to our ERP system for accurate and timely reporting. Management and support personnel have access to our proprietary business intelligence software which provides extensive time critical management data. 
Competition 
9

The restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location, convenience, food quality and presentation, and is affected by changes in local and national economic conditions, taste and eating habits of the public and population and traffic patterns. We compete with a variety of restaurants offering moderately priced food to the public, including other large, national QSRs. We also compete with supermarkets and convenience stores and other food outlets as described below. There is also active competition for competent employees and for the type of real estate sites suitable for our restaurants.
Pizza Hut
Within the QSR pizza segment, we compete directly with national chains and numerous regional chains and locally-owned restaurants which offer similar pizza, pasta and sandwich products. We do not compete with other operators in the Pizza Hut system. More broadly, we also compete in the food purchase industry against supermarkets and convenience stores that sell fresh and/or frozen pizzas and others that offer “take-and-bake” pizza products. In addition to more established competitors, we also face competition from new competitors and concepts such as fast casual pizza concepts. We believe that other companies can easily enter our market segment, which could result in the market becoming saturated, thereby adversely affecting our revenues and profits. Limited product variability within the pizza segment can make differentiation among competitors difficult. Thus, companies in the pizza segment continuously promote and market new product introductions, price discounts and bundled deals, and rely heavily on effective marketing and advertising to drive sales. The price charged for each menu item may vary from market to market (and within markets) depending on competitive pricing and the local cost structure.
Wendy’s
Our Wendy’s restaurants face competition from other food service operations within the same geographical area. Wendy’s restaurants compete with other restaurant companies and food outlets, primarily through the quality, variety, convenience, price, and value perception of food products offered. We compete directly with national chains and numerous regional chains and locally-owned restaurants which offer similar hamburger and sandwich products. The location of units, quality and speed of service, attractiveness of facilities, effectiveness of marketing and new product development by Wendy’s and its competitors are also important factors. The price charged for each menu item may vary from market to market (and within markets) depending on competitive pricing and the local cost structure. Additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases come from operators outside the restaurant industry. A number of major grocery chains offer fresh deli sandwiches and fully prepared food and meals to go as part of their deli sections. Some of these chains also have in-store cafes with service counters and tables where consumers can order and consume a full menu of items prepared especially for that portion of the operation. Additionally, convenience stores and retail outlets at gas stations frequently offer sandwiches and other foods.
Intellectual Property 
The trade name “Pizza Hut,” and all other trademarks, service marks, symbols, slogans, emblems, logos and design used in the Pizza Hut system are owned by PHI. The “WingStreet” name is a trademark of WingStreet, LLC. The trade name “Wendy’s” and all other trade names, trademarks, service marks, symbols, slogans, emblems, logos and designs used in the Wendy’s system are owned by affiliates of Wendy’s. All of the foregoing are of material importance to our business and are licensed to us under our franchise agreements for use with respect to the operation and promotion of our restaurants. 
Government Regulation 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals. 
A small portion of our net product sales are attributable to the sale of beer. A license is required for each site that sells alcoholic beverages (in most cases, with renewal on an annual basis) and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time.
Regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages relate to many aspects of restaurant operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. 
We are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as employment and pay practices, overtime, tip credits and working conditions. The bulk of our employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to the federal and state minimum wages. We are also subject to federal and state child labor laws, which, among other things, prohibit the use of certain hazardous equipment by employees 18 years of age or younger. We have not, to date, been materially adversely affected by such laws.

We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy and consumer credit, protection and fraud. We are also subject to laws relating to nutritional content, nutritional labeling, product safety and menu labeling. Additionally, we are subject to federal and state environmental regulations.
We are subject to federal and state laws regarding health care, including legislation that in some cases requires employers to either provide health care coverage to their full-time employees, pay a penalty or pay into a fund that would provide coverage for them. 
We are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or “ADA.” The ADA is a federal law which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommodation, communications and activities of government. In part, the ADA requires that public accommodations, or entities licensed to do business with the public, such as restaurants, are accessible to those with disabilities. 
Seasonality 
Our Pizza Hut business is moderately seasonal in nature with net product sales typically being higher in the first half of the fiscal year. Our Wendy’s business is also moderately seasonal in nature with net product sales typically being higher in the spring and summer months. As a result of these seasonal fluctuations, our operating results may vary between fiscal quarters. Further, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 
Working Capital Practices 
Our working capital was a deficit of $68.7 million as of December 27, 2016. Like many other restaurant companies, we are able to operate and generally do operate with a working capital deficit because (i) restaurant revenues are received primarily in cash or by credit card with a low level of accounts receivable; (ii) rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories; and (iii) cash from sales is usually received before related liabilities for food, supplies and payroll become due. Because we are able to operate with a working capital deficit, we have historically utilized excess cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility for debt reduction, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and to provide liquidity for our working capital needs. Although not required, we currently pay the next day for certain of our supply purchases in order to take advantage of a prompt-payment discount from our primary distributors. If we were to utilize the 30 day term of trade credit for these distributors, it would increase our cash position by approximately $31.0 million; however this would not impact our working capital.
