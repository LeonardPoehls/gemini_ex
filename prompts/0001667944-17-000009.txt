Forward‑Looking Statements
This Form 10‑K contains forward‑looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “seek,” “expect” and words of similar meaning. These forward‑looking statements include, but are not limited to:

• | Statements of our goals, intentions and expectations;


• | Statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies;

These forward‑looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of our management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward‑looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change.
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward‑looking statements:

• | General economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected;


• | Competition among depository and other financial institutions;


• | Inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields or reduce the fair value of financial instruments;


• | Our success in continuing to emphasize agricultural and commercial loans;

• | Changes in our organization, compensation and benefit plans;


• | Our ability to retain key employees;


• | Changes in the level of government support for housing finance;

• | Significant increases in our loan losses


• | Weaknesses in internal control; and


• | Changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own.

Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward‑looking statements.
WCF Bancorp, Inc.
WCF Bancorp, Inc., an Iowa corporation (the Company), was organized in March 2016. Upon completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion of WCF Financial MHC (the MHC) in July 2016, the Company became the registered savings and loan holding company of WCF Financial Bank (the Bank) and succeeded to all of the business and operations of Webster City Federal Bancorp (the Old Bancorp), a federal corporation, and each of Webster City Federal Bancorp and the MHC ceased to exist. Since the completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion, the Company has not engaged in any significant business activity other than owning the common stock of WCF Financial Bank and making a loan to Bank's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, the Company has engaged in no material operations to date. Our executive office is located at 401 Fair Meadow Drive, Webster City, Iowa, and our telephone number at that address is (515) 832-3071.
WCF Financial Bank
WCF Financial Bank is an Iowa-based community bank that was chartered and began operations in 1934, and has operated in Webster City, Iowa continuously since this date. In January 2014 we completed our acquisition of Independence Federal Bank for Savings. We operate our business through our main office in Webster City, Iowa, and one full-service branch in Independence, Iowa. We believe our locations are strategically positioned within the State of Iowa along Highway 20, covering central and eastern portions of the state.
We are engaged primarily in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in real estate loans secured by one-to-four-family residences. To a lesser extent we also originate consumer loans and non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans. On a limited basis, we have also originated commercial real estate loans, but have deemphasized the origination, and intend to continue to deemphasize the origination of this type of lending. Our primary lending area is broader than our primary deposit market area and includes north central and northeastern Iowa. We also invest in securities. Our revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and securities, and from loan origination and servicing fees. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the FHLB).
As a federal savings bank, WCF Financial Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC).

Market Area
We conduct our operations from our two offices located in Webster City, Iowa and Independence, Iowa. Webster City is the county seat for Hamilton County, Iowa, and Independence is the county seat of Buchanan County, Iowa. We consider Hamilton County and Buchanan County, Iowa, and the surrounding contiguous counties, to be our primary market area. 
Hamilton County is located approximately 60 miles north, and Buchanan County is approximately 125 miles northeast, of Des Moines, Iowa. Both counties consist primarily of small towns and rural areas. The total populations for Hamilton and Buchanan County, according to the Unites States Census Bureau in 2015, were approximately 15,000 and 21,000, respectively. According to SNL Financial, the population in Buchanan County has increased between the years 2010 to 2016, with a population growth rate of 0.80%, while the population in Hamilton County has decreased between the years 2010 to 2016, with a negative population growth rate of (4.82)%. The average median household income for 2016 for Hamilton County was $45,576, while the average median income for 2016 for Buchanan County was $62,984. By contrast, the national level of median household income for 2016 was $55,551. By 2021, the projected increases in household income are expected to be 0.72% for Hamilton County and 11.52% for Buchanan County. By 2021, the projected national level of increase in median household income is expected to be 7.77%.
The economy of our market area is heavily dependent on farming and agriculture. The major employers in our market area include the Van Diest Supply Company and the Van Diest Medical Center, Webster City Community School District, John Deere and the government of Webster City.
Competition
We face intense competition in our market areas both in making loans and attracting deposits. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds and insurance companies. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. 
Lending Activities
Our primary lending activity is the origination of one-to-four family residential real estate loans. To a lesser extent, we also originate consumer loans and non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans (which we sometimes refer to as one-to-four family investment property loans). On a very limited basis, we have originated commercial real estate and land loans. However, in recent years we have significantly reduced the emphasis on these types of loans and we do not intend to emphasize these types of loans in the future.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. We make loans according to written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and value of the property that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, we review the borrower’s employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. We require “full documentation” on all of our loan applications.
Our policies and loan approval limits are established by the board of directors. For one-to-four family residential real estate loans, our loan committee, which is comprised of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Senior Vice President, Chief Lending Officer and another loan officer, has loan authority of up to $250,000. All one-to-four family residential real estate loans above $250,000 require the approval of our board of directors. For consumer loans, our loan officers have loan authority of up to $25,000. All consumer loans above $25,000 require the approval of the loan committee. All loans not requiring board approval are ratified at the next regularly scheduled board meeting.
We require appraisals of all real property securing one-to-four family residential real estate loans and non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans. All appraisers are state-licensed or state-certified appraisers, and are approved by the board of directors annually.
One-to-Four Family Residential Real Estate Loans. Our primary lending consists of originating owner occupied, one-to-four family residential real estate loans, substantially all of which are secured by properties located in our market area. At December 31, 2016, $47.3 million, or 76.9% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans. We offer these loans with fixed-rate maturities of up to 30 years as well as adjustable rates. In recent years, in the historically low interest rate environment, nearly all of our one-to-four family residential real estate loan originations have had fixed-rates of interest. The average loan balance of our one-to-four family residential real estate loans at December 31, 2016 was $53,000. 
One-to-four family residential real estate loans are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate one-to-four family residential real estate loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which is generally $417,000 for single-family homes. We maintain in our portfolio all of the loans that we originate, except we currently sell most fixed-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans with maturities of greater than 20 years.
Our adjustable-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans generally consist of loans with initial interest rates fixed for one, three, five or seven years, and annual adjustments thereafter are indexed based on changes in the Monthly Federal Cost of Funds Index. Our adjustable-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans generally have an interest rate adjustment limit of 200 basis points per adjustment, with a maximum lifetime interest rate adjustment limit of 600 basis points. In the current 
8

low interest rate environment, we have originated a significant dollar amount of adjustable-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans.
Generally, we originate one-to-four family residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 80%, and will, on occasion, originate loans with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 90% with private mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not originate a significant amount of one-to-four family residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%. All borrowers are required to obtain an abstract of title and a title opinion. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance.
We do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on one-to-four family residential properties (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer “subprime loans” (loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation).
Non-owner occupied One-to-four family Residential Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2016, $3.7 million, or 6.1%, of our total loan portfolio, consisted of non-owner occupied, or “investment,” one-to-four family residential real estate loans, all of which were secured by properties located in our market area. At December 31, 2016, our non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans had an average balance of $37,000. 
We originate fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans secured by non-owner occupied one-to-four family properties. These loans may have a term of up to 20 years. In recent years, in the historically low interest rate environment, nearly all of our non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential loan originations have fixed-rates of interest. We generally lend up to 75% of the property’s appraised value. Appraised values are determined by an outside independent appraiser. In deciding to originate a loan secured by a non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential property, we review the creditworthiness of the borrower, the expected cash flow from the property securing the loan, the cash flow requirements of the borrower and the value of the property securing the loan. We require an abstract of title, a title opinion, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property.
Non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential loans, however, entail greater credit risks compared to the owner occupied one-to-four family residential mortgage loans we originate. The payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property.
Commercial Real Estate Loans. On a very limited basis, we have offered commercial real estate loans. In recent years we have significantly reduced the origination of these types of loans, and we do not intend to emphasize the origination of these types of loans in the future. At December 31, 2016, $3.6 million, or 6.0% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial real estate loans, which are generally secured by retail, industrial, service or other commercial properties and loans secured by raw land. At December 31, 2016, our commercial real estate loans had an average balance of $75,000 and the latest maturity -+was January 2047. 
We have offered fixed-rate and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans. In recent years, in the historically low interest rate environment, nearly all of our commercial real estate loan originations have 
9

had adjustable-rates of interest. These loans generally have terms of up to 20 years. We generally lend up to 75% of the property’s appraised value. Appraised values are determined by an outside independent appraiser. In evaluating the property securing the loan, we review the creditworthiness of the borrower, the expected cash flow from the property securing the loan, the cash flow requirements of the borrower, the value and condition of the property securing the loan and the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we emphasize the ratio of the property’s projected net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum ratio of 1.15 times), computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses we deem appropriate. We require an abstract of title, a title opinion, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property.
Commercial real estate loans afford us the opportunity to earn higher yields than those obtainable on one-to-four family residential real estate lending. Nevertheless, commercial real estate lending may involve greater risk than one-to-four family residential real estate loans because the loans generally have larger principal balances and repayment of these loans is dependent on the successful operation or management of the commercial property securing the loan. The success of the loan may also be affected by many factors outside the control of the borrower. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than residential properties. Land loans pose additional risks because the property generally does not produce income and may be relatively illiquid.
Consumer Loans. We offer a variety of consumer loans including new and used automobile loans, home improvement and home equity loans, recreational vehicle loans, and loans secured by certificates of deposits. At December 31, 2016, consumer loans totaled $6.6 million, or 11.0% of our loan portfolio, of which $4.3 million, or 65.2%, were automobile loans. At this date, $414,000 of our consumer loans were unsecured.
Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. We intend to continue to emphasize and grow our portfolio of consumer loans in the future.
Consumer loans generally have greater risk compared to longer-term loans secured by improved, owner occupied real estate, particularly consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
We also offer home equity loans secured by a first or second mortgage on residential property. Our home equity loans are made with fixed or adjustable rates, and with combined loan-to-value ratios up to 90% on an owner occupied principal residence or 100% with equity protection program insurance.
Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales and Servicing. Lending activities are conducted by our loan personnel operating at our offices. All loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our standard policies and procedures. Our ability to originate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for such loans and competition from other lenders, which is affected by market interest rates as well as anticipated future market interest rates. Our loan origination and sales activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment, which typically results in decreased loan demand. Our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel, existing customers, referrals from realtors, residential home builders, automobile dealers and walk-in business.
10

In recent years we have not purchased loans, and we do not intend to purchase loans in the near future. Pursuant to our acquisition of Independence Bank in January 2014, we acquired $10.5 million in loans, substantially all of which were secured by properties located in Buchanan County, Iowa.
Substantially all of the one-to-four family residential real estate loans that we originate meet the underwriting guidelines established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In recent years, we have sold our conforming, fixed-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans that have terms of greater than 20 years, on a servicing-released basis.

Non-Performing and Problem Assets
Delinquency Procedures. When a borrower fails to make a required monthly loan payment, a late notice is generated, generally on the 15th day after the payment due date, stating the payment and late charges due. A follow-up notice is sent every 15 days thereafter. On a case-by-case basis, we will also include follow-up phone calls. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time future payments are not reasonably assured or the loan is 90 days delinquent, unless the credit is well secured. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Our President and Chief Executive Officer determines on a case-by-case basis further actions. If the loan is reinstated, foreclosure proceedings will be discontinued and the borrower will be permitted to continue to make payments. The loan will remain on nonaccrual status until a timely repayment history of six months has been established.
11

When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed real estate held for sale until it is sold. The real estate is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition less estimated costs to sell which establishes a new cost basis. Any write-down resulting from the acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Estimated fair value is based on a new appraisal or an in-house evaluation which is obtained as soon as practicable, typically at the start of the foreclosure proceeding. Subsequent decreases in the value of the property are charged to operations. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized as long as the total cost basis of the property does not exceed estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.
Delinquent Loans. The following table sets forth our loan delinquencies by type and amount of type at the dates indicated.

Non-Performing Assets. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time future payments are not reasonably assured or the loan is 90 days delinquent, unless the credit is well secured. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans is applied against principal. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectibility of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. Restructured loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the revised contractual terms for a reasonable period of time (typically six months) and the ultimate collectibility of the total contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured.
The following table sets forth information regarding our non-performing assets at the dates indicated. We had no troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) at the dates indicated.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was immaterial, and the amount of interest we recorded on these loans was $0.
At December 31, 2016, nonaccrual loans consisted of four one-to-four family residential real estate loans totaling $291,778, nine non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate totaling $314,379, one commercial real estate loan totaling $297,538, and three consumer loans totaling $8,554.
At December 31, 2016, we had $1.3 million in loans that were not currently classified as nonaccrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings, but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with existing loan repayment terms and that could result in disclosure as nonaccrual, 90 days past due or troubled debt restructurings.
Troubled Debt Restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings are defined under ASC 310-40 to include loans for which either a portion of interest or principal has been forgiven, or for loans modified at interest rates or on terms materially less favorable than current market rates. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no loans that were classified as a troubled debt restructuring.
Foreclosed Real Estate Held for Sale. At December 31, 2016, we had $58,000 in foreclosed real estate held for sale, consisting of one residential real estate property.
Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as “substandard”, “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral 
13

pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention/watch” by our management.
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required to charge-off the amount of such assets. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional loss allowances.
In connection with the filing of our periodic reports and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the “watch list” initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing as agreed, or because of delinquency status, or if the loan possesses weaknesses although currently performing. Management reviews the status of each loan on our watch list with the Loan Committee and then with the full board of directors at the next regularly scheduled board meeting. If the asset quality of a loan deteriorates, the classification is changed to “special mention/watch,” “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status and classified “substandard.”
Assets that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification, but which possess potential weaknesses that deserve our close attention, are required to be designated as special mention/watch. As of December 31, 2016, we had $1.6 million of assets designated as special mention/watch.
We regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of our review of our assets at December 31, 2016, substandard assets consisted of loans of $1.1 million. There were no doubtful or loss assets at December 31, 2016.
As of December 31, 2016, our largest substandard loan classification had a principal balance of approximately $298,000 and was secured by raw land. Management believes this loan is adequately collateralized.

Allowance for Loan Losses
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses. Our allowance for loan losses is the amount considered necessary to reflect probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on at least a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.
Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements: (1) specific allowances for impaired loans, and (2) a general valuation allowance for non-impaired loans. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio.
This analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment.
Specific Allowances on Impaired Loans. We establish a specific allowance when non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate and commercial loans are determined to be impaired. Loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. Factors in identifying a specific problem loan include: (1) the strength of the customer’s personal or business cash flows; (2) the availability of other sources of repayment; (3) the amount due or past due; (4) the type and value of collateral; (5) the strength of our collateral position; (6) the estimated cost to sell the collateral; and (7) the borrower’s effort to cure the delinquency. In addition, for loans secured by real estate, we consider the extent of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral for the mortgage.
General Valuation Allowance on Non-impaired Loans. We establish a general allowance for non-impaired loans to recognize the probable losses associated with lending activities. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience for the last three years, adjusted for qualitative factors that could impact the allowance for loan losses. These qualitative factors may include risk selection and underwriting standards, and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; level of experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff experience; quality of the loan review system; nature, trends in volume of the portfolio and terms of loans; volume and severity of past due loans; value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans; credit concentrations and levels of such concentrations; external factors (i.e. competition, legal and regulatory) on level of estimated credit losses; and national, regional and local economic trends and conditions. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current real estate environment.
15

In addition, as an integral part of their examination process, the OCC with respect to WCF Financial Bank, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City with respect to WCF Bancorp, Inc. will periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations.
The allowance for loan losses decreased $18,000, or 3.6%, to $487,000 at December 31, 2016 from $505,000 at December 31, 2015. In addition, the allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable decreased to 0.80% at December 31, 2016 from 0.88% at December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans decreased to 41.87% at December 31, 2016 from 64.01% at December 31, 2015. To the best of our knowledge, we have provided for all losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Investment Activities
General. Our investment policy is established by the board of directors. Our investment policy dictates that investment decisions will be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity and pledging requirements, our interest rate risk and our potential long term earnings. The Investment Committee of the board of directors is responsible for overseeing our investment program and evaluating on an ongoing basis our investment policy and objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer has the authority to purchase securities within specific guidelines established by the investment policy. All transactions are reviewed by the board of directors at its regular meetings. U.S. GAAP requires that securities be categorized as “held to maturity,” “trading securities” or “available-for-sale,” based on management’s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security. U.S. GAAP allows debt securities to be classified as “held to maturity” and reported in financial statements at amortized cost only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Securities that might be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the security’s prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, or other similar factors cannot be classified as “held to maturity.”
At December 31, 2016, all of our securities were classified as available-for-sale.
Our investment policy does not permit hedging activities, such as futures, options or swap transactions, gains trading or short sales. Additionally, securities deemed unacceptable for our portfolio include any security whose interest rate is tied to a foreign currency exchange rate.
The following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our securities portfolio (excluding Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines and Bankers’ Bank common stock) at the dates indicated. At the dates indicated, all of our investment securities were held as available-for-sale.

Sources of Funds
General. Deposits traditionally have been our primary source of funds for our lending activities and, as applicable, other investments. We also borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines to supplement cash flow needs, and at December 31, 2016 we had $5.5 million of FHLB advances outstanding. We also have an available line of credit in the amount of $2.5 million at Bankers’ Bank, of which there was no amount outstanding at December 31, 2016. Our additional sources of funds are scheduled loan repayments, loan prepayments, retained earnings and the proceeds of loan and securities sales.
Deposits. We accept deposits primarily from individuals who reside in and businesses located in our market area. We rely on our competitive pricing and products, convenient location and quality customer service to attract and retain deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of statement savings accounts, money market accounts, NOW accounts and certificates of deposits.
Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market interest rates, liquidity requirements and our deposit growth goals. Historically we have not relied on brokered deposits and at December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any brokered deposits.

Supervision and Regulation
General
As a federal savings bank, WCF Financial Bank is subject to examination and regulation by the OCC, and is also subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which WCF Financial Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders. WCF Financial Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.
Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as WCF Financial Bank or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches.
In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network.
As a savings and loan holding company, WCF Bancorp, Inc. is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and will be subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board. WCF Bancorp, Inc. is also be subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of WCF Bancorp, Inc. and WCF Financial Bank.
Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to WCF Financial Bank and WCF Bancorp, Inc. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on WCF Financial Bank and WCF Bancorp, Inc.
Federal Banking Regulation
Business Activities. A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, WCF Financial Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. WCF Financial Bank may also establish subsidiaries that may engage 
21

in certain activities not otherwise permissible for WCF Financial Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage.
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio, a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 5.125%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.625%, and a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.625%. These capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets on January 1, 2019. 
At December 31, 2016, WCF Financial Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.
Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2016, WCF Financial Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings association, WCF Financial Bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test. Under the QTL test, WCF Financial Bank must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association’s business.

WCF Financial Bank also may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This test generally requires a savings association to have at least 75% of its deposits held by the public and earn at least 25% of its income from loans and U.S. government obligations. Alternatively, a savings association can satisfy this test by maintaining at least 60% of its assets in cash, real estate loans and U.S. Government or state obligations.
A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2016, WCF Financial Bank satisfied the QTL test. 
Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings association’s capital account. A federal savings association must file an application with the OCC for approval of a capital distribution if:

• | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings association’s net income for that year to date plus the savings association’s retained net income for the preceding two years;


• | the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;


• | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or


• | the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings, generally due to an unsatisfactory CAMELS rating or being subject to a cease and desist order or formal written agreement that requires action to improve the institution’s financial condition.

Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as WCF Financial Bank, must still file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.
A notice or application related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if:

• | the federal savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution;


• | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or


• | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.

In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings association also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form.
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the OCC is required to assess the federal savings association’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in 
23

denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to publicly disclose their rating. WCF Financial Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination.
Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings association’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as WCF Financial Bank. WCF Bancorp, Inc. is an affiliate of WCF Financial Bank because of its control of WCF Financial Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.
WCF Financial Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:

• | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and


• | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of WCF Financial Bank’s capital

In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by WCF Financial Bank’s board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.
Enforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, shareholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings association. Formal enforcement action by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances.
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, 
24

interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, among other things, recent amendments made by the Dodd-Frank Act permit banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state.
Prompt Corrective Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
The applicable OCC regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. Under the amended regulations, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a tangible capital ratio of 5.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a tangible capital ratio of 4.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 5.125% or greater, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.625% or greater, and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.625% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 5.125% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.625%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.625%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a tangible capital ratio of less than 3.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, or a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. An undercapitalized bank’s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the Federal Reserve Board to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, 
25

requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.
At December 31, 2016, WCF Financial Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized.”
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such as WCF Financial Bank. Deposit accounts in WCF Financial Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.
Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution’s risk category and certain specified risk adjustments. Institutions deemed to be less risky pay lower rates while institutions deemed riskier pay higher rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 2 1/2 to 45 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC’s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s deposits.
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC, which has exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2%.
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of WCF Financial Bank. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.70 basis points of total assets less tangible capital.
Privacy Regulations. Federal regulations generally require that WCF Financial Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, WCF Financial Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to “optout” of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. WCF Financial Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations.
26

USA Patriot Act. WCF Financial Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act contains provisions intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies and imposes affirmative obligations on financial institutions, such as enhanced recordkeeping and customer identification requirements.
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Federal savings associations are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Other Regulations
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by WCF Financial Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and


• | Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal and state laws.

The deposit operations of WCF Financial Bank also are subject to, among others, the:

• | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;


• | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.

Federal Reserve System
The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating $103.6 million or less (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3.0% and the amounts greater than $103.6 million require a 10.0% reserve (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board between 8.0% and 14.0%).
27

The first $14.5 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. WCF Financial Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
WCF Financial Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. WCF Financial Bank was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2016. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. WCF Financial Bank reviews for impairment, based on the ultimate recoverability, the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines stock. As of December 31, 2016, no impairment has been recognized.
Holding Company Regulation
WCF Bancorp, Inc. is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over WCF Bancorp, Inc. and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to WCF Financial Bank.
As a savings and loan holding company, WCF Bancorp, Inc.’s activities are limited to those activities permissible by law for financial holding companies or multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. Such activities include lending and other activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, insurance and underwriting equity securities. Multiple savings and loan holding companies are authorized to engage in activities specified by federal regulation, including activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act.
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository institution not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider such things as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on and the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. A savings and loan holding company may not acquire a savings institution in another state and hold the target institution as a separate subsidiary unless it is a supervisory acquisition under Section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state companies.
Savings and loan holding companies historically have not been subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Board to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for all depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. However, legislation was enacted in December 2014 that required the Federal Reserve Board to amend its “Small Bank Holding Company” exemption from consolidated holding company capital requirements to generally extend its applicability to bank and savings and loan holding companies of up to $1 billion in assets. Regulations implementing this amendment were effective May 15, 2015. Consequently, savings and loan holding companies of under $1 billion in consolidated assets remain exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the Federal Reserve determines otherwise in particular cases. 
28

The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the “source of strength” policy that require holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of WCF Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Federal Securities Laws
WCF Bancorp, Inc. common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. WCF Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.
Change in Control Regulations
Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company such as WCF Bancorp, Inc. unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a savings and loan holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with WCF Bancorp, Inc., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires 
29

such control becomes a “savings and loan holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.
TAXATION
WCF Bancorp, Inc. and WCF Financial Bank are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to WCF Bancorp, Inc. or WCF Financial Bank.
WCF Bancorp, Inc. is currently open to audit under statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2016. Neither the federal tax return nor the state tax return has been audited for the last five years.
Federal Taxation
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, WCF Bancorp, Inc. and WCF Financial Bank currently report their income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a tax year ending December 31 for filing their federal income tax returns.
Bad Debt Reserves. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), WCF Financial Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at our taxable income. As a result of the 1996 Act, WCF Financial Bank has elected to use the experience method in computing its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal tax return. Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve). At December 31, 2016, WCF Financial Bank had no reserves subject to recapture in excess of its base year reserves.
Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if WCF Financial Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. Federal legislation has eliminated these thrift-related recapture rules. At December 31, 2016, our total federal pre-1988 base year reserve was approximately $2.1 million. However, under current law, pre-1988 base year reserves remain subject to recapture if WCF Financial Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its stock, pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or ceases to maintain a bank charter.
Alternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, which we refer to as “alternative minimum taxable income.” The AMT is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain AMT payments may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2016, WCF Bancorp, Inc. had $35,000 of AMT payments available to carry forward to future periods.
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A company may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2016, WCF Bancorp, Inc. had $370,000 in net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes.
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. WCF Bancorp, Inc. may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from WCF Financial Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 80% in the case of dividends received from a corporation in which a corporate recipient owns at least 20% of its stock, and corporations that own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 70% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf.
30

State Taxation
WCF Bancorp, Inc. files an Iowa corporation tax return, and the Bank files an Iowa franchise income tax return. The Iowa corporate income tax rate ranges from 6% to 12% depending upon Iowa taxable income. Interest from federal securities is not taxable for purposes of the Iowa corporate income tax.
Iowa imposes a financial institution franchise tax, in lieu of the corporate income tax, on the Iowa franchise taxable income of financial institutions at the rate of 5%. Iowa franchise taxable income is generally similar to federal taxable income except that interest from state and municipal obligations is taxable, and no deduction is allowed for state franchise taxes. The net operating loss carryforward rules are similar to the federal rules. However, Iowa no longer allows carrybacks of net operating losses for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2009.
