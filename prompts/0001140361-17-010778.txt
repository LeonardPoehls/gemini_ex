Most of our technology specialists work from their homes rather than in brick-and-mortar facilities. We are compensated for our services on a per-incident, per-subscription or labor rate basis.
 
Our Support.com Cloud offering is a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solution for companies to optimize support interactions with their customers using their own or third party support personnel. The solution enables companies to quickly resolve complex technology issues for their customers, boosting support agent productivity, providing ease of use for customer self-service, and dramatically improving the customer experience.
 
We also offer end-user software products including tools and apps designed to address some of the most common technology issues, including computer and mobile device maintenance, optimization and security.
 
We market our technology support services primarily through partners, who resell the services to their customers or include them in their service offerings. Our Support.com Cloud offering is marketed directly, primarily through our sales team as well as through partners. We market our end-user software products directly, principally online, and through partners. Our sales and marketing efforts are primarily focused in North America.
 
Industry Background
 
Technology has become an essential feature of the modern home and office. Products such as personal computers, printers, tablets, smartphones, digital cameras, connected entertainment systems, home automation and other smart home appliances have become ubiquitous. Each year, these products become more feature-rich, offering many new capabilities. Consumers and SMBs now depend on such technology for “must-have” information, communication and entertainment as well as for tasks and activities of our daily lives.
 
Technology has also become increasingly connected, with networks now commonplace in the home as well as the office, and with the “Internet of Things” adding a diverse array of sensors that monitor, track and automate the physical world.  At the same time, technology has become increasingly mobile, with anytime/anywhere access to voice, data, video and applications becoming commonplace.
 
For consumers and SMBs, the complexity of the technology environment creates challenges in obtaining the benefits of the connected home and office. For customer support organizations it results in more difficult problems to solve, including the need to support third-party products in addition to their own offerings. The proliferation of smartphones (77% of American adults own a smartphone, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center study) and connected devices (the average US broadband home today has eight connected devices, according to a 2016 Parks Associates report compels customer support organizations to fundamentally transform how interactive support is delivered. An Accenture survey finds that 64% of consumers encounter challenges using “intelligent devices”, such as wearables, connected home systems, and connected vehicle products. According to the Accenture study, the biggest challenges facing consumers are that the “intelligent devices” are too complicated to use, difficult to set-up, and do not work as advertised.  These trends in number of devices, connected nature of these devices, and the related complex ecosystem requires that customer support organizations use modern tools and analytics to fundamentally transform how interactive support is delivered.
 
Technology support is becoming increasingly critical to the overall customer experience, not just for technology products, but also for other products and services that depend on technology to deliver the brand value.  According to recent Forrester Research findings, customer experience leaders outperform the competition in the market, “confirming that customer experience correlates to revenue growth.” As a result, technology support solutions have begun to address the parts of the customer experience that are mediated by technology.

Our Technology Support Service Programs
 
Support.com® technology support services are distributed through partners, using the partner’s brand or in referral programs using the Support.com® brand.  Partners include retailers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), software providers, broadband providers, Internet services providers and warranty providers.  The services programs include one-time services (“incidents”), subscriptions, and bundled components of broader offerings.  Our programs are based on the following core services:
 
Connected Home and IoT Services.  For connected home technology and automation systems, we offer a complete range of services to help customers set up, configure and use new systems, including helping consumers personalize system settings to meet specific lifestyle needs.
 
Technical Support Services.  We offer a variety of troubleshooting, installation, set-up and enablement services for computers, peripherals and mobile devices and their connectivity. We identify, diagnose and repair technical problems, including issues associated with viruses, spyware, and other forms of malware, connectivity issues, and issues with software applications.

We deliver our services using specialists who work from their homes rather than in brick and mortar facilities. These technology specialists are recruited, tested, hired and trained on a virtual basis using proprietary methods and remote technology. We also utilize contract labor in our service programs. We strive to continually enhance service delivery through evolution of our labor model, process improvement using Six Sigma methodologies and enhancement of our internal service delivery management tools.

Our Support.com Cloud offering includes the following cloud applications:
 
 
1. | Agent Support – our flagship application for automated guidance for customer support agents leading to more productive and engaged support teams, a more consistent support experience and higher customer satisfaction.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Self-Support – a newly released application for contextual self-service support for end-consumers either via the web or mobile apps leading to lower customer effort, a better customer experience and higher customer retention and loyalty.

Key features of our Support.com Cloud offering include:
 
Smart Guidance. Patent-pending Guided Paths® codify the organization’s best practices and ensures that agents and customers get the right guidance at the right time to help resolve customer problems. Guided Paths go beyond knowledge articles and decision trees to gather contextual information and pertinent device data and to automate time-consuming, multi-step activities in ways that lead to effective and consistent problem resolution and satisfied customers.
Blended Support Capability. A context engine tracks and analyzes information about what the end-customer is trying to achieve and about what activities they have already taken to help themselves. This context is maintained across support channels – for instance, if the customer escalates from self-service to assisted support - and leads to a seamless blended support experience and reduced customer effort, overcoming one of the most frequent customer complaints about customer support experiences.
Remote Support Tools. A set of advanced tools including remote access, screen co-browsing, on-screen assistance, and SeeSupport - remote video support using the customer’s smart phone as a camera - is available to support representatives enabling them to quickly and effectively troubleshoot technical problems.
Data and Analytics.  Our cloud-based data architecture brings “Big Data” benefits to technology support, delivering business insights from rich data captured during service delivery and enabling organizations to track program performance and identify potential issues and inefficiencies.
 
Web-based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).  Open APIs enable integration with other contact center applications (such as ticketing systems, CRM platforms or knowledge bases) so that our Support.com Cloud applications can be fully integrated into the agent-customer interaction. The open API’s allow for data transfer and sharing between applications.
 
Our End-User Software Products
 
Our end-user software products are designed to maintain, optimize and secure computers and mobile devices. Certain software products are licensed on a perpetual basis while others are offered on a subscription basis.
 
Our principal software products include products designed for malware protection and removal (SUPERAntiSpyware®), PC, smartphone and tablet maintenance and optimization (Cosmos®), and PC registry cleaning and repair (ARO®).
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Technology Support Services.   We sell our services principally through partners. Our partners include leading communication providers, retailers, and technology companies.
 
Our partnerships typically begin with a pilot phase and can take several weeks to more than a year to progress to a broader roll-out. We typically wholesale services to our partners on a per-incident, per-subscription or labor rate basis and our partners resell the services to consumers and SMBs at prices our partners determine or bundle them with other services.  In these partnerships, the services are generally sold under the partner’s brand.  In certain cases, in addition to service delivery we sell the services on our partner’s behalf and receive commissions.
 
We acquire partners through our business development organization, and we support partners through our account management organization.

Support.com Cloud Offering.  We license Support.com Cloud applications separately from support services provided by our technology specialists.  In such an arrangement, customers receive the right to use our cloud-based software in their own technology support organization, using a SaaS model under which customers pay us on a per-user or a per-session basis during the term of the arrangement. We also provide implementation services to customers, typically covering integration of our software with other customer’s systems. We charge for these services on a time-and-materials basis or as part of a fixed-fee package.
 
We acquire Support.com Cloud customers through our direct sales channel, which uses a variety of Internet-based lead generation strategies, thought leadership initiatives and industry presence marketing to drive demand.  We also acquire customers through our partner channels.
 
End-User Software Products.  We license our end-user software products directly to customers and through partners. To date, a majority of our end-user software revenue has come through direct sales to customers. Online advertising allows customers to click through to our software offerings where they can order and download our products on demand. In addition to fully featured software products available for a license fee, a substantial percentage of our end-user software revenue arises from customers who download free trial versions of our software or free versions of our software with limited functionality before making a purchase decision.
Research and Development
 
Technology is at the core of our business model and a direct source of revenue and growth, and as a result our recent investment in research and development is critical. Our Support.com cloud-based software creates a competitive advantage for us as we seek to be both the premier provider of turnkey support programs and a leading best-of-breed software supplier for technology support organizations.  We maintain dedicated research and development teams in Redwood City, California, Bangalore, India, and Eugene, Oregon. Research and development expense was $5.6 million in 2016, $7.0 million in 2015, and $5.1 million in 2014.
 
We have developed, maintain, and continue to improve proprietary, market-leading, cloud-based technologies that are essential to our business. We focus our investment in research and development across the following major areas: SaaS solutions for support interaction optimization; endpoint applications and other extensions to gather data to assist support interactions and allow remote support when necessary; business analytics and reporting; open application interfaces; and internal service delivery management tools.
 
Our SaaS technology includes patent-pending Guided Paths automated workflows, remote control of customer devices, automated device and systems data collection, and business analytics.
 
The service delivery management tools used by our agents for technology support services include our own Support.com cloud-based software capabilities and other contact center applications such as customer relationship management (“CRM”), ticketing, ordering, methods of payment, and telephony, which are all integrated into highly effective and efficient application for our technology specialists.
 
For business analytics and reporting, we build and maintain a data warehouse that securely aggregates and restructures data from all of our applications to create a comprehensive view of the service delivery lifecycle, as well as data about the disposition of support interactions.  This rich data set provides visibility into sales conversion effectiveness, service delivery efficiency, service level performance, subscription utilization, partner program performance and many other aspects of running and optimizing our business.  Our partners also receive reports and analytic information from the warehouse for their programs on a regular basis via secure data feeds, or they can access reports via an online reporting portal.
 
Open application interfaces of our Support.com Cloud enable integration with CRM, ticketing systems, and other contact center applications.
 
For end-user software, we build and enhance the products described under “Our End-User Software Products”.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own the registered trademarks SUPPORT.COM, GUIDED PATHS, PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS, BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS and NEXUS in the United States for specified support services and software, and we have registrations and common law rights for several related trademarks in the U.S. and certain other countries. We own the domain name support.com and other domain names. We have exclusive rights to our proprietary services technology, and our end user software products. We also have non-exclusive rights to distribute certain other software products.

We own three U.S. patents related to our business and have a number of pending patent applications covering certain advanced technology. Our issued patents include U.S. Patent No. 8,020,190 (“Enhanced Browser Security”), U.S. Patent No. 6,754,707 (“Secure Computer Support System”) and U.S. Patent No. 6,167,358 (“System and Method for Remotely Monitoring a Plurality of Computer-Based Systems”). We do not know if our current patent applications or any future patent application will result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. Also, we do not know whether any patents we have or may receive will be challenged or invalidated. It is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as they do in the United States, and our competitors may develop technology that competes with ours but nevertheless does not infringe our intellectual property rights.
 
We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark and contractual protection to establish and protect our proprietary rights that are not protected by patents. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants involved in product development. We generally require our employees, customers and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we will disclose any sensitive aspects of our business. Also, we generally require employees and contractors to agree to assign and surrender to us any proprietary information, inventions or other intellectual property they generate while working for us in the scope of employment. These precautions, and our efforts to register and protect our intellectual property, may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property.
 
Competition
 
We are active in markets that are highly competitive and subject to rapid change. Although we do not believe there is one principal competitor for all aspects of our offerings, we do compete with a number of other vendors.
 
With respect to partnerships for our technology support services, our competitors include privately-held companies focused on premium technology services, providers of electronics warranties, emerging IoT technology support providers, global business process outsourcing providers or contact centers focused on technical support and other companies who offer technical support through partners. We believe the principal competitive factors in our services market include: breadth and depth of service offerings; quality of the customer experience; proprietary technology; time to market; pricing; account management; vendor reputation; scale; and financial resources.
 
With respect to licenses of our Support.com Cloud offering, our competitors include companies focused on service desk, knowledge management, remote support and IT process automation. We believe the principal competitive factors in the Support Interaction Optimization (“SIO”) space include breadth and depth of functionality; ease of implementation; performance; scalability; pricing; vendor reputation; financial resources; and customer support.  We believe that our Support.com Cloud offering can compete favorably because it provides an integrated end-to-end solution for SIO that stands out in terms of coverage of all the different areas of functionality required by customers.
 
In the market for our end-user software products, we face direct competition from software vendors, application providers, operating system providers, network equipment manufacturers, and other original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that may provide similar solutions and function in their products, and from individuals and groups who offer “free” and open source utilities online.
 
The competitors in our markets for services and software can have some or all of the following competitive advantages: longer operating histories, greater economies of scale, greater financial resources, greater engineering and technical resources, greater sales and marketing resources, stronger strategic alliances and distribution channels, larger user bases, products with different functions and feature sets and greater brand recognition than we have. We expect new competitors to continue to enter the markets in which we operate.
 
For additional information related to competition, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
We are not aware at this time of any material effects that compliance with Federal, State and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, may have on our business. Our assessment could change if and when any new regulations of such sort are enacted or adopted.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,525 employees, of whom 1,396 were work-from-home agents and 129 were corporate employees. In addition to our work-from-home employees, we also use contract labor.  None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
