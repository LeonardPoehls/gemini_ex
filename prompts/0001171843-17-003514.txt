Item 1. Business
 
Founded in 1974, HMS is a leading provider of cost containment solutions in the U.S. healthcare marketplace. We use innovative technology, extensive data services and powerful analytics, to deliver coordination of benefits, payment integrity and health management and engagement solutions to help healthcare payers improve performance and outcomes. We provide coordination of benefits services to government and commercial healthcare payers and sponsors to ensure that the responsible party pays healthcare claims. Our payment integrity services ensure healthcare claims billed are accurate and appropriate; and our care management technology helps risk-bearing organizations manage the care delivered to their members. Together these various services help customers recover amounts from liable third parties; prevent future improper payments; reduce fraud, waste and abuse; better manage the care that members receive; and ensure regulatory compliance.
 
HMS began its operations as Health Management Systems, Inc., which became our wholly owned subsidiary in March 2003 when we assumed its business in connection with the adoption of a holding company structure. Since then HMS has grown both organically and through targeted acquisitions of businesses that helped expand our product suite, including IntegriGuard, LLC (2009), HealthDataInsights, Inc.(“HDI”) (2011), Essette, Inc. (2016), Eliza Holding Corp. (2017) and others.


We were originally incorporated in the State of New York in October 2002 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in July 2013. Our principal executive offices are located 5615 High Point Drive, Irving, Texas 75038 and our telephone number is (214) 453-3000.
 
We operate as one business segment with a single management team that reports to the Chief Executive Officer.
 
Our Solutions
 
Our coordination of benefits services draw principally upon proprietary information management and data mining techniques designed to ensure that the correct party pays a healthcare claim. Our payment integrity services are designed to ensure that healthcare billings and/or payments are accurate and appropriate. As a result of these services, customers received billions of dollars in cash recoveries in 2016, and saved billions more through the prevention of erroneous payments. In addition, our care management solutions help risk-bearing organizations manage the care delivered to their members with a focus on improving outcomes and patient engagement.

Our services are applicable to federal, state and commercial health plans and prevent and address errors across the payment continuum, from an individual’s enrollment in a program before any medical service is rendered, to pre-payment review of a claim by a payer, through recovery where discovery of an improper payment is made via audit. Our services address a wide spectrum of payment errors, from eligibility and coordination of benefits errors, to the identification and investigation of potential fraud, and extend to most claim types. Our services also assist customers in managing quality, risk, cost and compliance across all lines of business.
 

In general, our range of services includes the following:
 

§ | Coordination of benefits services
--+----------------------------------


We provide cost avoidance services, which include providing validated insurance coverage information that is used by government-sponsored payers to coordinate benefits properly for future claims. With validated insurance information, Medicaid payers can avoid unnecessary costs by ensuring that they pay only after all other benefits available have been exhausted, thereby complying with federal regulations that require Medicaid to be the payer of last resort. Nevertheless, due to a variety of factors, some Medicaid claims are paid even when there is a known responsible third party. Our government-sponsored program customers rely on us to identify those claims that were paid in error and recover these payments from the liable third party. Further, we also provide services to assist customers in identifying other third-party insurance and recovering medical expenses where a member is involved in a casualty or tort incident. Lastly, for Medicaid agencies exclusively, we provide estate recovery services to identify and recover Medicaid expenditures from the estates of deceased Medicaid members in accordance with state policies. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our coordination of benefits services represented 72.3%, 71.2% and 70.5% of our total revenue, respectively.



§ | Payment integrity services
--+---------------------------


Our payment integrity services are applicable to all markets that HMS serves, including the federal and state governments, commercial health plans and other at-risk entities. Our solutions are designed to verify that medical services are utilized, billed and paid appropriately. Our services combine data analytics, clinical expertise and proprietary technology to identify improper payments on both a pre-payment and post-payment basis; identify and recover overpayments/underpayments; detect and prevent fraud, waste and abuse; and identify process improvements. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our payment integrity services represented 24.3%, 24.5% and 24.5% of our total revenue, respectively.

§ | Care management and member analytics technologies
--+--------------------------------------------------

 We offer a web-based care management platform which helps risk-bearing healthcare organizations identify, engage, and manage at-risk patient populations to improve outcomes while managing costs.
 
Customers
 
For each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 no one individual Company customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue.
 
The composition of our 10 largest customers changes periodically. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our 10 largest customers represented 40.6%, 44.0% and 40.1% of our total revenue, respectively. The current terms of our agreements with these customers have expiration dates ranging between 2017 and 2020. Several of our contracts, including those with some of our largest customers, may be terminated for convenience. The early termination of a contract with one of our significant customers may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


We provide products and services under contracts (or sub-contracts) that contain various revenue structures, including contingent revenue and fixed-fee arrangements. Most of our contracts have terms ranging from three to five years, including renewal terms at the option of the customer. In many instances, we provide our services pursuant to agreements that are subject to periodic reprocurements. Because we provide our services pursuant to agreements that are open to competition from various businesses in the U.S. healthcare insurance benefit cost containment marketplace, we cannot provide assurance that our contracts, including those with our largest customers, will not be terminated for convenience, awarded to other parties, or renewed. Additionally, we cannot provide assurance that our contracts, if renewed, will have the same fee structures or otherwise be on satisfactory terms.
 
Industry Trends and Opportunities
 
U.S. healthcare expenditures continue to escalate and consume a large proportion of our GDP, presenting challenges for payers who wish to contain and reduce costs while also promoting quality healthcare outcomes. These aims are the same across all at-risk entities, including commercial health plans and government healthcare programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare.
 
Within the commercial market, health plans sell policies directly to individuals (on the open market or via health insurance exchanges), contract with employers to underwrite their employees’ care, or contract with self-insured employers to oversee benefit administration to their employees. This market also includes a growing number of risk bearing provider-sponsored plans that operate and market health plan benefits. According to CMS NHE projections, private health insurance covered 195 million individuals in 2016 at a cost of $1.09 trillion.
 
Several commercial health plans also offer government-sponsored lines of business, including partnering with Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP to oversee care delivery for beneficiaries enrolled in those programs. Government managed care grew out of pressures to contain the growth of state and federal program spending and to address general concerns about healthcare access. Commercial health plan-related partnerships with government programs include the following:
 

§ | Within the Medicaid program, 38 states and the District of Columbia presently contract with managed care organizations to provide care to some or all of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition, many states have expanded the use of managed care organizations to new regions or to serve beneficiaries with more complex conditions. Of the 32 states and the District of Columbia that opted to expand Medicaid eligibility levels pursuant to the ACA, all except 5 use Medicaid managed care organizations. The majority of new lives that have entered the Medicaid program as a result of the ACA are enrolled in managed care plans. It is unclear at this time how, if at all, efforts in Congress to “repeal and replace” the ACA could affect any of the state expansions or future growth of Medicaid lives and expenditures.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Similarly, managed care health plans also continue to assume risk for Medicare lives, with the Kaiser Family Foundation estimating that in 2016, nearly one-third of all Medicare recipients were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.

HMS also continues to serve government-sponsored agencies’ legacy fee-for-service programs at the state and federal level. These plans are generally reliant on and susceptible to the government appropriations process that determines their budget and governs the number of beneficiaries they serve.
 
According to the CMS NHE projections, Medicare programs in 2016 covered approximately 56 million people at a cost of approximately $681 billion and Medicaid/CHIP covered approximately 77 million people, costing approximately $593 billion. Altogether, it is projected that the government programs we serve covered approximately 130 million people at a total cost of approximately $1.3 trillion in 2016. Based on the CMS NHE Projections, Medicare spending is projected to grow 5.8% in 2017 over 2016, and CMS projects Medicaid enrollment will grow by 1.7% in 2017 over 2016. Total Medicaid spending is projected to increase at a rate of 4.8% in 2017 over 2016. 
 
As commercial and government health plans continue to focus on strategies to contain costs across their different lines of business, we will continue to focus on serving them and meeting their evolving needs. Regardless of the program, coordinating benefits among a growing number of healthcare payers and ensuring that claims are paid appropriately represents an enormous challenge for our customers and an ongoing opportunity for us.
 
Regulatory Environment
 
The market for cost containment solutions is large and growing, driven by increasing healthcare costs and payment complexities. For 2017, Medicare and Medicaid are projected to pay approximately 45.9% of the nation’s healthcare expenditures and serve over 130 million beneficiaries. Many of these beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care plans, which have the responsibility for both patient care and claim adjudications. Since 1985, we have provided state Medicaid agencies with services to identify third parties with primary liability for Medicaid claims, and since 2005, we have provided similar services to Medicaid managed care plans.
 
In 2006, Congress enacted the DRA and created the Medicaid Integrity Program under the Social Security Act to increase the government’s capacity to prevent, detect and address fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program. Later that year, Congress passed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which established the Medicare RAC program. HDI was awarded one of the first contracts under the program. In October 2016, CMS made a new round of awards and we again were awarded a region.
 
These measures, at both the federal and state level, have strengthened our ability to identify and recover erroneous payments on behalf of our customers.
 
The ACA was signed into law in 2010. It included many provisions impacting healthcare delivery and payment programs, including employer-sponsored health coverage, expansion of the Medicaid program, health insurance exchanges with premium subsidies, and payment integrity efforts. Following the 2016 Presidential and Congressional elections, some or all of the ACA provisions may be revised or repealed, although the scope and timing of such Congressional efforts are yet to be defined. Options that have been discussed include issuing block grants or establishing per capita caps for state Medicaid populations, and looking at program design alternatives for future enrollment criteria. We will monitor ACA-related changes as they develop and assess their potential impact, as well as any opportunities they may present for our customers and for us.
 
Competition
 
The U.S. healthcare insurance benefit cost containment marketplace is a dynamic industry with a range of businesses currently able to offer cost containment services, both directly or indirectly (through sub-contracting), to some or all of the various healthcare payers. In addition, with improvements in technology and the growth in healthcare spending, new businesses are incentivized to enter this marketplace. Many healthcare payers also have the ability to perform some or all of these cost containment services themselves and choose to exercise that option. Competition is therefore robust as customers have many alternatives available to them in their effort to contain healthcare costs.

We compete based on a variety of factors, including our ability to perform a wide range of coordination of benefits and payment integrity related functions; proven results to maximize recoveries and cost avoidance; our in-depth government healthcare program experience; clinical staff expertise; extensive insurance eligibility database; proprietary systems and processes; existing relationships with various customer and other industry shareholders; and our ability to provide customers with actionable intelligence to improve outcomes and patient engagement.
 
Within our core coordination of benefits services, we compete primarily with large business outsourcing and technology firms, claims processors and PBMs, clearinghouses, healthcare consulting firms, smaller regional vendors and other TPL service providers. In addition, we frequently work with customers who may elect to perform some or all of their recovery and cost avoidance functions in-house. The competitive environment for payment integrity services includes some of the same companies that provide coordination of benefits services. Within the care management and risk analytics sector, we compete primarily with vendors who provide these and other population health management technology services. Companies with whom we compete across our product offerings include:
 

§ | ChangeHealthcare | § | Experian Health | § | Verscend Technologies
--+------------------+---+----------------------------+---+----------------------
§ | Cotiviti | § | IBM/Truven | § | CaseNet 
§ | HP | § | LexisNexis | § | MedHok 
§ | Optum, Inc. | § | Performant Financial Corp. | § | Trizetto 
§ | Xerox | § | SCIO Health Analytics | § | ZeOmega 

Business Strategy
 
We believe that the steadily increasing enrollment and rising expenditures for Medicare and Medicaid, with most new enrollees entering managed care plans; an aging U.S. population with an increasing concentration of individuals with high cost chronic conditions; and the overall complexity of the healthcare claims payment system in the U.S. all combine to create substantial growth opportunities for the suite of cost containment solutions which we offer. We also believe that these factors similarly present growth opportunities for our care management solutions. We expect to grow our business over the course of 2017 and beyond, both organically and inorganically, by leveraging existing key assets (e.g., our data, analytics and in-house expertise, and distribution channel) and pursuing a number of strategic objectives or initiatives, including:

§ | Expanding the scope of our relationship with existing customers – by selling additional products and services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Adding new customers – by marketing to commercial health plans, including Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage plans, at-risk group and individual health lines of business and ASO; government healthcare payers, including Medicaid agencies, state employee health benefit plans and CHIP; at-risk provider organizations and ACOs; and commercial employers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Introducing new “homegrown” products and services – through internal development initiatives designed to enhance or expand our existing suite of cost containment products. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Utilizing big data – to create a more nimble operating environment and to identify new revenue opportunities within our current service delivery models. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Promoting automation and innovation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services – by continuing to implement new technology and process improvements designed to increase recovery yields and increase customer satisfaction. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Building out our new health management and member engagement technology platform – by establishing a broad foundation of technology and service solutions to help customers better manage quality, cost and compliance across all lines of business. Our first step in this strategy was the acquisition of Essette Inc., a care management platform, in September 2016. More recently, we acquired Eliza Holding Corp., which provides comprehensive and personalized outreach and health engagement solutions, in April 2017.

§ | Continuing opportunistic growth via acquisition – by selectively seeking assets to complement our core cost-containment expertise; build care management and care coordination adjacencies to complement the Essette and Eliza acquisitions; and expand our data analytics capabilities. Our focus is on acquisitions that have long-term growth potential; target high-growth areas; are accretive to earnings; and fill a strategic need in our business portfolio as we seek to provide increasingly comprehensive solutions to our customers.

Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,315 employees, of which 2,287 were full-time. Of our total employees, 253 support SG&A activities.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others are important to our business and competitive position. We establish and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property through a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade secrets, including know-how, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, security measures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual rights. As a result of acquiring Eliza Holding Corp. on April 17, 2017, we now own a patent portfolio comprised of approximately 55 domestic and international patents and patent applications. We do not believe that any one individual technology is essential to our business.
