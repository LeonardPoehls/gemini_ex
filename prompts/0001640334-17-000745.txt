Forward-Looking Statements
 
Certain statements contained in this report, including statements regarding our business, financial condition, our intent, belief or current expectations, primarily with respect to the future operating performance of the Company and other statements contained herein regarding matters that are not historical facts, are "forward-looking" statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by those that are not historical in nature, particularly those that use terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “contemplates,” “estimates,” “believes,” “plans,” “projected,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these similar terms. Future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, future press releases and future oral or written statements made by us or with our approval, which are not statements of historical fact, may contain forward-looking statements. Because such statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

The consideration paid for the Shares, which represented 84.7% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company on a fully-diluted basis, was $325,000. The source of the cash consideration for the Shares was the personal funds of Mrs. Cui. In connection with the transaction, Mr. Nedrygaylo released the Company from all debts owed to him.

Juanzi Cui, who took control of the Company as described above, intended that the Company open a line of health food stores or stores-in-stores within the Asian communities in the United States. Given our limited resources and the fact that we have never generated any revenues from the sale of our products, we are no longer focused on operating a business and have abandoned our initial business plan. Although our sole officer and director intends to have the Company open a line of health food stores or stores-in-stores within the Asian communities in the United States, we might just identify and negotiate with another company for the business combination or merger of that entity with and into our company. We would seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in one or more business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of a publicly held corporation. At this time, we have no plan, proposal, agreement, understanding or arrangement to acquire or merge with any specific business or company, and the Company has not identified any specific business or company for investigation and evaluation. No member of management or promoter of the Company has had any material discussions with any other company with respect to any acquisition of that company.
 
We will not restrict our search for another target company to any specific business, industry or geographical location, and the Company may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature. We are subject to the reporting required by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), we also qualify as a “shell company,” because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements.
 
A business combination with a target company normally will involve the transfer to the target company of the majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, and the substitution by the target company of its own management and board of directors. No assurances can be given that we will be able to enter into a business combination, or, if we do enter into such a business combination, no assurances can be given as to the terms of a business combination, or as to the nature of the target company.
 
Competition
 
The Company is an insignificant participant among firms which engage in business combinations with development stage enterprises. There are many established management and financial consulting companies and venture capital firms which have significantly greater financial and personnel resources, technical expertise and experience than the Company. In view of the Company's limited financial resources and management availability, the Company will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis the Company's competitors.
Regulation and Taxation
 
The Investment Company Act of 1940 defines an "investment company" as an issuer which is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading of securities. While the Company does not intend to engage in such activities, the Company could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in the event the Company obtains or continues to hold a minority interest in a number of development stage enterprises. The Company could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs if required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Accordingly, management will continue to review the Company's activities from time to time with a view toward reducing the likelihood the Company could be classified as an "investment company."
 
The Company intends to structure a merger or acquisition in such manner as to minimize Federal and state tax consequences to the Company and to any target company.
