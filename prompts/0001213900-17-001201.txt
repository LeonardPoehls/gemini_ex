Item 1.     Business
 
Guangdong Gewang was founded in June 2010 in Guangzhou City, with registered capital of RMB 10 million (US$1,561,000). Guangdong Gewang is engaged in the sale of selenium supplements within the PRC. It is a standing member of the Chinese Selenium Supplements Association.
 
Guangdong Gewang initiated its business by cooperating with the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of Shandong Province (the Academy) in the development of formulas for three selenium supplements: a selenium capsule, a capsule combining selenium with glossy ganoderma (a therapeutic mushroom), and a selenium powder. The Academy has given Guangdong Gewang an exclusive license to manufacture and market the three products. As a result of our relationship with the Academy, Guangdong Gewang has required no investment in research and development within the past three years other than payments directly to the Academy.
 
The Academy also assisted Guangdong Gewang in identifying manufacturing companies possessing the advanced nanometer processing technology and production processes needed to produce the products. Guangdong Gewang now outsources the manufacturing of the products, then sells them under the trademarked brand “Jindanli”. We currently have three separate trademarks in China on aspects of the Jindanli brand, which expire in 2022, 2023 and 2025, at which time Guangdong Gewang can apply for renewal. The Jindanli brand is important to our efforts to distinguish our products from other manufacturers.
 
Guangdong Gewang entered into a Licensing Agreement and a License Agreement Supplement Agreement (together, the “Licensing Agreements”) with the Academy which have been in effect since December 30, 2015. The Licensing Agreements have a term of five years and allow Guangdong Gewang the exclusive right to use the Academy-developed selenium formulas in its trademarked Jindanli branded products. The selenium formulas belong to the Academy but Guangdong Gewang has a license to use the formulas as it sees fit, including by contracting with third-party manufacturers to produce the products. The formulas are trade secrets, and Guangdong Gewang is contractually obligated to ensure the confidentiality of the formulas pursuant to the Licensing Agreements. The Academy must notify Guangdong Gewang of any improvements or upgrades to the selenium formulas, whereupon Guangdong Gewang has the option to choose to use the new formulas in its products. The Licensing Agreements require Guangdong Gewang to pay an annual fee of 600,000 RMB ($87,000).

In September 2016 Guangdong Gewang entered into an additional agreement with the Academy, under which the Academy granted Guangdong Gewang an exclusive right of first refusal to use any research related to advanced selenium enrichment techniques and technology developed by the Academy relating to selenium research techniques. The agreement calls for annual payments of 4,000,000 RMB ($580,000) payable quarterly. Additional payments will be required for use of any techniques or technology developed by the Academy.
 
Initially, for the convenience of management, Guangdong Gewang marketed exclusively on a wholesale basis to chain stores that retail health care products. Early in 2014, as the Registrant developed the necessary infrastructure, Guangdong Gewang commenced direct marketing to consumers from its executive “home office.” Subsequently we have opened three more physical stores dedicated to the sale of the three Jindanli products.
 
In March 2016, Guangdong Gewang entered into cooperation agreements with 6 selenium enriched food product manufacturers for Guangdong Gewang to distribute their selenium enriched food products to chain stores and to sell these products in Guangdong Gewang’s retail stores. Guangdong Gewang pays promotion fees to chain stores to ensure optimal product placement and widespread distribution of these products. Guangdong Gewang has worked with the Academy to ensure that each of these selenium enriched food product manufacturers meets its standards. Guangdong Gewang has also begun to sell these selenium enriched food products in its flagship retail store alongside its Jindanli branded selenium products. The wholesale and retail sales of selenium enriched food products has broadened Guangdong Gewang’s reach in China and helped to further expand the Registrant’s market share in selenium products beyond selenium supplements.
 
Selenium
 
Background on Selenium
 
Selenium is one of the “essential” nutrients for humans, meaning that our bodies cannot produce it, and so we have to get it from our diet. Selenium deficiency can cause health problems including Keshan’s disease, and the World Health Organization has found that between 50 and 250 micrograms of selenium constitute a healthy daily intake.
 
Selenium was discovered as an element in 1817 by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who determined the atomic weights of many elements and developed a system of chemical symbols. It was first thought to be a toxin, but scientists determined that selenium was an essential mineral in the 1950s. By the 1960s doctors began researching selenium’s possible tumor fighting properties in animals, according to the American Cancer Society.
 
Scientists now know selenium is necessary in the body’s production of selenoproteins, a family of proteins that contain selenium in the form of an amino acid. So far, 25 different selenoproteins in the body have been isolated, but only half of their functions have been identified. Selenium is one of several nutrients known to have antioxidant properties, meaning selenium plays a part in chemical reactions that stop free radicals from damaging cells and DNA. Free radicals are unstable molecules from environmental toxins, or from byproducts of the human body’s metabolism. In 1973, a paper published by JT Rotruk et al. showed that selenium is the basic component of erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), an enzyme that removes harmful substances produced by cell respiration. Further research into the antioxidant functions of selenium have shown that six other enzymes (glycine reductase, formate dehydrogenase, nicotinic acid hydroxylase, sulfur dehydrogenase and xanthine solution enzyme) are activated only in the presence of selenium.

Human and animal research has found selenoproteins are involved in embryo development, thyroid hormone metabolism, antioxidant defense, sperm production, muscle function and the immune system’s response to vaccinations. Antioxidant supplements, including selenium, are often touted to help prevent heart disease, cancer and vision loss.
 
According to the Chinese Selenium Supplements Association, selenium is purported to help people with asthma, and reduce the risk of rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease. Selenium levels drop with age, so some have claimed selenium can slow the aging process, cognitive decline and dementia. Low selenium levels are also implicated in depression, male infertility, weak immune systems and thyroid problems.
 
Plants grown in soil containing selenium convert it into a form that is usable by humans or animals. Soil around the world varies in its selenium concentration. The higher the concentration of selenium is in soil, the higher the concentration of selenium is in crops. Soil in Nebraska, South and North Dakota, for example, is especially rich in selenium, and people living in these areas typically have the highest dietary intake of selenium in the United States.
 
Soil in some areas of China and Russia is naturally low in selenium. Selenium deficiencies in the Keshan region in northeast China were severe enough to spur a form of heart disease called cardiomyopathy, now called Keshan’s disease. Chinese government programs to supplement people’s diets with selenium in the 1970s greatly reduced cases of Keshan disease, according to the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Dietary Supplements. Low selenium levels in China, Tibet and Siberia may also play a role in a type of osteoarthritis called Kashin-Beck disease.
 
Seventy-two percent (72%) of the land in China is selenium-poor. In the area from the three provinces in Northeast China to the Yunnan Guizhou plateau, two-thirds of the arable land is recognized as having a selenium deficiency, where the selenium content of the principal crops is less than 0.05ppm.
 
Selenium Toxicity
 
The human body only needs a trace amount of selenium, so it is possible to overdose with selenium supplements. For example, in 2008, a liquid dietary supplement that was 200 times more concentrated than advertised led to selenium poisoning in more than 200 people in the U.S. The most common effects were diarrhea, fatigue, hair loss, joint pain, brittle nails and nausea. A third of the people affected continued to experience symptoms 90 days after taking the mislabeled supplements.
 
Taking too much selenium over time can lead to selenosis, which can cause hair loss, nail loss, nausea, irritability, fatigue and some nerve damage. Other symptoms of chronic selenium overdose are a metallic taste in the mouth, and a garlic scent on the breath. A selenium overdose can cause skin lesions and nervous system abnormalities. In severe cases, selenium toxicity can cause tremors, kidney failure, cardiac failure, respiratory distress or even death.
 
The Institute of Medicine’s Food and Nutrition Board caps the safe daily intake of selenium at 45 micrograms for infants, 60 to 90 micrograms in toddlers, 150 to 280 micrograms in prepubescent children and 400 micrograms in adults.
 
Selenium may increase the risk of bleeding if it is combined with blood thinners such as clopidogrel (Plavix), coumadin, heparin or aspirin, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. Animal studies show selenium supplements may also extend the effects of sedatives. Antioxidant supplements that included selenium have been shown to interfere with cholesterol-lowering treatments.
 
For these reasons, our marketing program combines both information about the need for adequate selenium intake with advice and warnings about the risk of excess ingestion of selenium.

The Opportunity in China
 
We believe that the importance of selenium to human health and the fact of selenium deficiency in large parts of China create a vast market potential for development. Selenium has been studied extensively in China. These efforts have resulted in confirming that selenium is an important element for human health and that there are areas within China that are significantly deficient in the soil and water. In the past decade, Chinese government policy has helped to enhance the potential of the selenium market.
 
Since 2008, the government has assisted Ankang City in developing selenium-rich products as a pillar industry. Government officials reviewed the experience of selenium supplements at home and abroad, and solicited the opinions of experts on selenium supplement research. Based on that review, the government developed the first provincial “selenium content standards” for Shaanxi Province, completed a census of selenium-rich resources in Ankang prefecture, drew an atlas of soil rich in selenium, established a selenium-rich food label system, selenium research and development institutions, cultivated selenium-rich food enterprises, organized a food industry association, and established a sound selenium-rich food industry development framework and system. These activities evidence the government’s support of the selenium industry.
 
The selenium industry is still in its infancy. It is currently fragmented with no dominant players. According to the Chinese Selenium Supplements Association, over three hundred, mostly small, enterprises are engaged in producing selenium products. Production costs are high because the products have not yet achieved economic scale. In addition, because the industry is new, the quality of selenium-rich health products is uneven, in part due to the lack of a nationwide standard for selenium products in China. In spite of these challenges, the selenium industry as a whole grew to 26.6 billion RMB (US$4.6 billion) in 2015 with a historical annual growth rate of 9.3% to 13.1%, and we believe the industry will experience rapid growth in the future.
 
Our Products
 
Through a partnership with the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of Shangdong Province, a highly regarded research institute in China, we have licensed the exclusive right to contract for the manufacture and marketing of products using three selenium formulas developed and owned by the Academy. In compensation for the license, we pay the Academy a fee of 50,000 RMB ($8,104) per month.
 
Currently Guangong Gewang distributes 89 distinct products which include processed foods such as selenium enriched porridge, ready to eat foods such as selenium-enriched peanuts and ingredients such as selenium enriched flower. Guangong Gewang is actively engaged in marketing healthy selenium rich foods including Selenium-Rich Maize Residue, Selenium-Rich Brown Rice. Selenium Enriched Black Beans, Selenium-Enriched Buckwheat Kernel and Selenium-Enriched Ormosia. These foods compliment the Registrant’s Jindanli branded products by raising awareness of the need for selenium in the diets of our target consumer market.
 
We currently offer the following products for sale under the brand “Jindanli”:
 

● | Selenium Capsules. 12% of our sales in fiscal year 2016 were sales of our selenium capsules. The selenium capsules are sold in a box of 300 capsules, with a recommended dosage of one capsule twice daily. A box of selenium capsules (i.e. a five month supply) retails for 1,380 RMB ($215) with a wholesale price of 650 RMB ($101).

● | Selenium - Glossy Ganoderma Capsules. 8% of our sales in fiscal year 2016 were sales of our selenium - glossy ganoderma capsules. Glossy ganoderma is an edible fungus, known as the “magical oriental mushroom” in traditional Chinese medicine. Glossy ganoderma is believed to boost energy, control blood pressure, and strengthen the immune system. Guangdong Gewang offers glossy ganoderma combined with selenium because the anti-oxidant effects of the selenium help prevent oxidation of the glossy ganoderma spore powder, thereby maximizing the effectiveness of the glossy ganoderma. A box of 300 selenium - glossy ganoderma capsules (i.e. a five month supply) retails for 1,380 RMB ($215) with a wholesale price of 650 RMB ($101). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Organic Selenium Powder. 6% of our sales in fiscal year 2016 were sales of our selenium powder. We offer the selenium powder in a box of 90 bags, with a recommended dosage of one or two bags daily. A box (i.e. a 1½ to three month supply) retails for 1,380 RMB ($215) with a wholesale price of 650 RMB ($101). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The only significant raw material needed for our selenium capsules and selenium powder is selenium. Selenium is readily available, as it has numerous industrial uses. For our selenium - glossy ganoderma capsules, we also need glossy ganoderma. Historically, the reisha mushroom, which is the source of glossy ganoderma, was rare in the wild. Recently, however, farmers have been successful in domesticating the reisha mushroom, which has resulted in an abundance of the reisha mushroom and of its derivative glossy ganoderma. As a result, sourcing our raw materials has not been a matter of concern, nor are we subject to significant effects from changes in the prices of our raw materials.
 
Our Manufacturing
 
Currently, we outsource our manufacturing to three production companies:
 

● | Yantai Yisheng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which produces our selenium capsules; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Taian Zhishengtang Ganoderma Lucidum Co., Ltd., which produces our selenium - glossy ganoderma capsules; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Beijing Technology Development Company of CAAS, which produces our organic selenium powder. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The inventory held by Guangdong Gewang consists only of inventory in our retail stores. Generally, upon receipt of an order from our customer, we place a corresponding order with the appropriate manufacturer. Guangdong Gewang and our colleagues at the Academy strictly supervise the production process, and we inspect and accept the finished product. When the products are ready for shipment, either our logistics team or the manufacturer (depending on our agreement with the manufacturer) engages a delivery service to pick up the product from the manufacturer’s site and deliver it to the customer.
 
We have signed with each manufacturer, as well as with the Academy, a Product Manufacture and Purchase Agreement. Each agreement has a five year term, and mandates that the products be manufactured to our specification, with the manufacturer bearing responsibility for any product defects. The agreement gives Guangdong Gewang the authority to supervise the manufacturing process. We have also signed with each manufacturer a Non-Disclosure Agreement, which requires the manufacturer to protect the product formula and trade secrets, and prevents the manufacturer from entering into any venture in competition with us.

Our Marketing
 
Selenium deficiency is harmful to all humans. It is of particular concern, however, to the elderly and to lactating women. As we deliver information to the populations of areas with selenium-poor soil, those two groups are our target market. Nevertheless, our staff is committed to raising awareness of selenium issues throughout China, particularly in the eastern regions with large populations and selenium-poor soil. Our marketing staff makes personal appearances throughout our prime markets, both to raise awareness of the problem of selenium deficiency and to educate consumers about the proper use of selenium supplements and the risks of excess selenium ingestion. Additionally, we plan to develop a media advertising program in the future.
 
At present, Guangdong Gewang has distribution agreements with sixteen major wholesale customers, including eight well-established customers that retail health care products and eight distributors that sell selenium-enriched food in China. Each wholesale customer is assigned an exclusive market and barred by contract from selling in other markets. The sixteen wholesale customers, their designated markets and the expiration of the respective contracts are:

Our distribution agreements fix the payment terms, which vary among customers. In each distribution agreement, Guangdong Gewang warrants that the products will conform to all the requirements set forth in the New National Pharmacopeia of the National Food and Drug Supervision and Management Bureau, and that all products will have a remaining viable period of no less than 12 months when delivered.
 
Our distribution agreements with the wholesale customers do not prevent them from selling competitor’s selenium products. Rather we assure ourselves of their loyalty by providing focused advertising of our brand in the chain stores’ markets, thereby making sale of the Jindanli products an attractive, low-effort proposition for our wholesale customers.

Our Competition
 
There are a limited number of name brands of selenium supplements in China, as the industry is in its early development period. In the markets where we do face competition, we emphasize the high quality of the Jindanli products such as the following:

● | The Jindanli Selenium Capsule is designed using carageenan capsules to offer rapid absorption and high quality, yielding a product useful for all persons in need of added selenium in their diet. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Jindanli Selenium - Glossy Ganoderma Capsules offer an attractive combination of contemporary biotechnology with traditional healing. We source pure ganoderma spore powder from Mount Taishan wood, combine it with Jindanli selenium and package it in a carageenan capsule. 
● | The Jindanli Organic Selenium Powder provides the benefits of selenium to infants and the infirm, for whom swallowing capsules is difficult. 



While the industry has grown significantly, we believe the market is still in its early stages which is why we believe the market is fragmented and lacking a nationally recognized brand of selenium supplements.
 
Due to the fragmented market comprised of small players, many potential customers’ initial experiences with selenium supplements are with what we believe to be inferior products, many of which make unsupportable health claims. According to the Chinese Selenium Supplements Association, this has led to a lack of confidence in the selenium supplements among the Chinese people. Therefore, our marketing strategy must include education and strong prudent promotion, coupled with publicity to build confidence in the industry and our brands.
 
We believe that the quality of our products, along with our association with top quality manufacturers and chain stores, will enable us to compete effectively and gain market share, as the selenium supplement industry grows.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Through our wholesale and retail operations, we are currently selling selenium products in Guangdong Province, Fujian Province, Zhejiang Province, Anhui Province, Hunan Province, Shanxi Province, Hubei Province and the cities of Tianjin, Shanghai and Shenzhen. We also have current plans to expand our sales through a combination of retail stores and wholesale chain stores to Jiangsu Province, Jiangxi Province, Chongqing Province and Sichuan Province. We have begun our efforts to establish a nationwide reach through the wholesale and retail operations carried on at our home office, and our immediate plan is to bring intense marketing to regions where the need for selenium supplements is most pronounced, by locating dedicated corporate stores in these key markets. The stores will feature the Jindanli products, allowing us, by our pronounced presence, to bring attention to the issue of selenium deficiency, attract new customers, and provide customers with the information about the proper use of selenium supplements. The stores will also function as promoters of the Jindanli brand, and we believe this will enable us to build our brand as a high quality choice and become a dominant player in the market.
 
We currently have four stores, strategically located near our large chain customers. We opened our first store, in Chancheng, in September 2014, and opened two more stores, in Xiamen and Changsha, during fiscal year 2015. In June 2016, we opened our flagship store in Guangzhou. Also in June 2016, our Chancheng store moved to Foshan, our Xianmen store moved to Longyan and our Changshai store moved to Zhuzhou. Our goal is to open up to 26 new stores in the fiscal year 2017. Each store requires an investment of 300,000 to 400,000 RMB ($47,000 to $62,000) along with working capital of 100,000 to 200,000 RMB ($16,000 to $31,000).

The stores do not carry any products that compete against the Jindanli brand products. However, the stores do carry other quality selenium products and related health food and other products allowing us to bring attention to the issue of selenium deficiency, attract new customers, provide them the information about the proper use of selenium supplements and offering a full array of quality selenium products and other health food and related products to allow customers to increase their understanding of selenium and one location for their health food and related products. The stores will also function as a training center for the employees of our large chain customers to support our education and marketing strategy throughout their respective stores with a focus on the Jindanli brand, allowing us to fill the void in the selenium industry that lacks any well-known brand.
 
Corporate Structure
 
China Gewang Biotechnology, Inc., our U.S. parent company (the “Registrant” or the “U.S. Company”) was incorporated on May 29, 2009 in the State of Nevada under the name Rich Star Development Corporation. On January 8, 2015 the U.S. Company’s corporate name was changed to “China Gewang Biotechnology, Inc.” The name change was effected as an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes Section 92A.200.
 
The U.S. Company was originally formed for the purpose of sourcing and distributing food products, paper products, janitorial products, restaurant utensils and equipment to the food service industry in the PRC. Due to lack of financing, the U.S. Company never initiated operations. On December 1, 2014, control of the U.S. Company was transferred by its management and its primary shareholders to Mr. Shili Zhang. Mr. Zhang immediately abandoned the U.S. Company’s prior business plan and set about causing the U.S. Company to acquire control of Guangdong Gewang.
 
Organization and Acquisition of Biotechnology International and Guangdong Gewang
 
The corporate structure of the U.S. Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates was developed through the following steps:
 

● | In June 2010 three individuals (Shili Zhang, Yun Zeng, Wei Xu) organized Guangdong Gewang as a limited liability company in China under the name “Guangzhou Qinxiyuan Food Co., Ltd.” The registered equity was allocated among the founders thus: Shili Zhang - 54%, Yun Zeng - 28%, Wei Xu - 18%. On December 27, 2011, the limited liability company changed its name to Guangzhou Qinxiyuan Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Subsequently on July 17, 2013, the name was changed to Guangdong Gewang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Since the time of its organization, Guangdong Gewang has been engaged in the wholesale marketing of selenium supplements. Since January 2014 it has also engaged in retail marketing of selenium supplements. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On June 3, 2014, Bing Hua Wu, a resident of the PRC, organized Hong Kong Gewang in Hong Kong. Bing Hua Wu organized Hong Kong Gewang at the behest of Shili Zhang, as the first step in Mr. Zhang’s plan to place Guangdong Gewang under foreign control. The registered capital of Hong Kong Gewang was 10,000 Hong Kong Dollars. Mr. Zhang established Hong Kong Gewang to take advantage of tax advantages offered by the government of China to WFOEs whose equity-owners are Hong Kong residents. On August 29, 2014, Bing Hua Wu transferred the capital stock of Hong Kong Gewang to Shili Zhang, who in turn transferred it to Bin Wang on October 17, 2014. On January 20, 2015, Bin Wang transferred the shares to Gao Yishi Yang, a resident of Beijing.

● | On March 10, 2015, Hong Kong Gewang received a Certificate of Approval from the local government of the PRC approving the establishment of Gewang Selenium as a WFOE wholly owned by Hong Kong Gewang. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On March 17, 2015, Shili Zhang organized Biotechnology International under the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 in the British Virgin Islands. Mr. Zhang was appointed Director of Biotechnology International, and held 25% of the outstanding shares. The remaining 50,000 shares were purchased for US$1.00 each by nineteen of Mr. Zhang’s business associates, none of whom acquired more than 4.9% of the outstanding shares. Mr. Zhang organized a British Virgin Islands holding company because the tax policies as well as the flexible corporation laws of the British Virgin Islands are advantageous to residents of the PRC requiring an offshore holding company.

● | On April 2, 2015, Gao Yishi Yang transferred to Biotechnology International all of the outstanding shares of Hong Kong Gewang in exchange for 10,000 Hong Kong Dollars. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On April 6, 2015, Gewang Selenium, Guangdong Gewang and the equity owners in Guangdong Gewang entered into the Variable Interest Entity Agreements (the “VIE Agreements”), as a result of which Guangdong Gewang became a controlled affiliate (variable interest entity) of Gewang Selenium. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On April 20, 2015, the U.S. Company acquired all of the capital stock of Biotechnology International through the Share Exchange with the shareholders of Biotechnology International. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On July 13, 2016, the U.S. Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Gewang Selenium, exercised its option to purchase all of the registered equity of Guangdong Gewang. The purchase price paid for the equity was RMB10,000 (approximately $1,500). The equity was purchased from Shili Zhang, Yun Zeng and Wei Xu. Shili Zhang was the U.S. Company's CEO until April 8, 2016 and is the father of Mengdi Zhang, who owned 12.7% of the U.S. Company’s outstanding common stock at the time of the sale on July 13, 2016. The other two sellers were not affiliated with the U.S. Company. Upon application to the provincial government for registration of the transfer of equity, the U.S. Company was informed that Gewang Selenium would not be permitted to own 100% of Guangdong Gewang. Therefore the parties modified the exercise of the option to provide that Gewang Selenium would purchase 98% of the registered equity of Guangdong Gewang. The remaining 2% of the registered equity was then sold by Yun Zeng to Haiping Wu for a price of RMB200,000 (approximately $30,000), which equaled 2% of the registered equity of Guangdong Gewang. The acquisition, as modified, was then approved by the provincial government on August 8, 2016. Prior to the acquisition, Gewang Selenium controlled Guangdong Gewang through a series of contractual agreements, which made Guangdong Gewang a variable interest entity, the effect of which was to cause the balance sheet and operating results of Guangdong Gewang to be consolidated with those of Gewang Selenium in the U.S. Company's financial statements. As a result of the acquisition by Gewang Selenium of registered ownership of Guangdong Gewang, the balance sheet and operating results of Guangdong Gewang will hereafter continue to be consolidated with those of Gewang Selenium as its majority owned subsidiary and the VIE Agreements are no longer in effect. The previous non-controlling interest has been reclassified to additional paid-in-capital.

Acquisition of Tianmei Australia and Guangdong Tianmei
 

● | On April 28, 2016, the Registrant's wholly-owned subsidiary, Biotechnology International, entered into an investment agreement with Guangdong Tianmei. The investment agreement provided that Biotechnology International would pay US$1,000,000 to acquire a 30% interest in an Australian corporation to be formed, which would indirectly own all of the equity in Guangdong Tianmei. On May 6, 2016, Biotechnology International participated in the organization of Tianmei Beverage Group Corporation Limited ("Tianmei Australia").
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On May 16, 2016, Tianmei Australia purchased all of the outstanding shares of Tianmei BVI. The purchase price paid by Tianmei Australia was US$50,000. The seller was not affiliated with the Registrant or its subsidiaries.

General Regulation of Businesses
 
We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable labor and safety laws and regulations in the PRC, including the PRC Labor Contract Law, the PRC Production Safety Law, the PRC Regulation for Insurance for Labor Injury, the PRC Unemployment Insurance Law, the PRC Provisional Insurance Measures for Maternity of Employees, PRC Interim Provisions on Registration of Social Insurance, PRC Interim Regulation on the Collection and Payment of Social Insurance Premiums and other related regulations, rules and provisions issued by the relevant governmental authorities from time to time.
 
According to the PRC Labor Contract Law, we are required to enter into labor contracts with our employees. We are required to pay no less than local minimum wages to our employees. We are also required to provide employees with labor safety and sanitation conditions meeting PRC government laws and regulations and carry out regular health examinations of our employees engaged in hazardous occupations.
 
Foreign Currency Exchange
 
The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in China is the Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended (2008). Under these Rules, the RMB is freely convertible for current account items, such as trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan or investment in securities outside China unless the prior approval of, and/or registration with, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the People’s Republic of China, or SAFE, or its local counterparts (as the case may be) is obtained.
 
Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, in China may purchase foreign currency without the approval of SAFE for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. They may also retain foreign exchange (subject to a cap approved by SAFE) to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. In addition, if a foreign company acquires a subsidiary in China, the acquired company will also become an FIE. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of FIEs to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In addition, foreign exchange transactions for direct investment, loans and investment in securities outside China are still subject to limitations and require approvals from, and/or registration with, SAFE.
 
Dividend Distributions
 
Under applicable PRC regulations, FIEs in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a FIE in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year as as general reserve until the cumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.
 
The Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementing rules generally provide that a 10% withholding tax applies to China-sourced income derived by non-resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes unless the jurisdiction of incorporation of such enterprises’ shareholder has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. Gewang Selenium is considered a FIE and is directly held by our subsidiary in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Gewang. According to a 2006 tax treaty between the Mainland and Hong Kong, dividends payable by an FIE in China to a company in Hong Kong that directly holds at least 25% of the equity interest in the FIE will be subject to a withholding tax of no more than 5%. We expect that such 5% withholding tax will apply to dividends paid to Hong Kong Gewang by Gewang Selenium, but this treatment will depend on our status as a non-resident enterprise.
