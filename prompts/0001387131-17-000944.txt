Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
We are an international Independent Power Producer (“IPP”) that is active in the global clean energy production and waste-to-energy markets. We aspire to become a key player in these rapidly growing markets by developing or acquiring projects with clean energy technologies, including but not limited to waste-to-energy facilities that generate clean energy, such as electricity, natural gas, heat, soil amendment and other by-products. These markets provide tremendous opportunity, insofar as we believe there is a virtually endless supply of waste and organic material that can be used to generate power and valuable by-products. In particular, the disposal of organic material to landfills in most parts of the world is a costly problem with environmentally-damaging consequences. We seek to offer a cost-effective, environmentally-safe alternative.
 
We are currently developing, constructing or operating, as applicable, fourteen (14) projects related to our strategy of acquisition, development or operations of waste-to-energy facilities, which includes developing projects for which we have entered into nonbinding letters of intent to acquire additional biogas facilities in Italy and to develop and construct waste-to-energy facilities in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Israel. We continue to evaluate a pipeline of similar projects in the pre-development phase in the above listed countries and we are also evaluating projects in other countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland, Canada and Mexico.
 We are currently developing, constructing or operating, as indicated below, the following projects:

Our strategy is to continue to expand in the future, including through acquisition of additional projects. From time to time we enter into nonbinding letters of intent for projects that we are evaluating. However, until the negotiations are finalized and the parties have executed a definitive agreement, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any development or acquisition transaction, on the terms in the applicable letter of intent or at all, or any other similar arrangements. Furthermore, any such transactions that we do enter into would be subject to the uncertainties regarding our existing projects described in the “Risk Factors” section. 
 
Our United States Projects
 
On October 19, 2012, we entered into definitive project agreements in respect of both the North Carolina and Rhode Island sites with Orbit Energy, Inc. (“Orbit”), pursuant to which we would be entitled to full ownership of each of the entities that owns the rights to implement the respective projects (Orbit Energy Charlotte, LLC in the case of the North Carolina project (“OEC”) and Orbit Energy Rhode Island, LLC in the case of the Rhode Island project (“OERI”)), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
Our North Carolina Project
 
The Amended OEC Purchase Agreement  
 On November 19, 2014, we signed an amended and restated purchase agreement with Orbit for the North Carolina project (the “Amended OEC Purchase Agreement”). Subject to the terms of the Amended OEC Purchase Agreement, Orbit transferred full ownership of OEC to us in exchange for our agreeing to pay Orbit a development fee of $900,000, reimbursement of $17,764 of Orbit’s expenses, and an amount equal to 30% of the distributable cash flow from the North Carolina project after the project achieves a post-recoupment 30% internal rate of return computed on the basis of any and all benefits from tax credits, depreciation and other incentives of any nature. We also agreed to use high solid anaerobic digester units designed by Orbit (the “HSAD Units”) and to retain Orbit to implement and operate the HSAD Units for an annual management fee of $187,500 (the “OEC Management Fee”), subject to certain conditions. The Amended OEC Purchase Agreement provided that we had until December 15, 2014 to pay Orbit the development fee and reimbursement amount, which was extended to January 15, 2015 upon payment by us to Orbit of $75,000. We did not subsequently pay Orbit the development fee and reimbursement amount and, pursuant to the terms of the Amended OEC Purchase Agreement, ownership of OEC reverted back to Orbit on January 15, 2015.
Concord Energy Partners, LLC  
 On January 30, 2015, (i) the Company, Concord Energy Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Concord”) and York Renewable Energy Partners LLC (“York”) entered into a development and indemnification agreement (the “Concord Development and Indemnification Agreement”), pursuant to which in 2015 York funded Concord’s payment to us of $1,250,000 in development fees, and Concord issued us 250 Series B units of Concord (“Concord Series B Units”) and issued 750 Series A units of Concord (“Concord Series A Units”) to York, and (ii) we and York entered into an amended and restated limited liability company operating agreement (the “Concord LLC Agreement”) to establish the Concord Series A Units and Concord Series B Units and admit us and York as 25% and 75% members of Concord, respectively. Pursuant to the foregoing agreements, York also agreed to pay us two equal installments of $587,500 upon (a) mechanical completion of the North Carolina project and (b) commercial operation of the North Carolina project. We have received payment of the first installment.
 
Pursuant to the Concord LLC Agreement, our right to receive distributions from Concord are subject to certain priorities in favor of York, as follows: 


(a) | The unpaid rate of return, equal to nine percent (9%) per annum and compounded annually, of unrecovered capital contributions outstanding, will be paid to York; 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | The unpaid and unrecovered capital contributions outstanding will be paid to York; 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | The amount of any excess profits from “feedstock tipping fees” shall be distributed with twenty percent (20%) going to York, and eighty percent (80%) going to us; 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | The amount of any excess profits from “thermal energy” shall be distributed equally between us and York; and 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(e) | Any amount remaining will be distributed pro-rata to us and York in proportion to York and our respective ownership of Concord. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, our right to receive distributions upon a liquidation event of Concord are subject to certain priorities in favor of York, as follows:  
 
(a) | The unpaid rate of return, equal to nine percent (9%) per annum and compounded annually, of unrecovered capital contributions outstanding, will be paid to York; 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | The unpaid and unrecovered capital contributions outstanding will be paid to York; and 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | Any amount remaining will be distributed pro-rata to us and York in proportion to York and our respective ownership of Concord. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pursuant to the Concord LLC Agreement, Concord is managed by a board of managers initially consisting of three managers (the “Concord Board”). So long as York owns more than 50% of the membership interests of Concord, York is entitled to appoint two of the Concord Board’s three managers. So long as we own no less than 50% of the membership interests of Concord that we acquired pursuant to the Concord Development and Indemnification Agreement, we are entitled to appoint one manager of the Concord Board. In the event that the Concord Board determines in good faith that additional equity capital is needed by Concord and is in the best interests of the North Carolina project, the Concord Board may determine the amount of additional capital needed and issue new units to raise the necessary funds. In this case, if we do not exercise our pre-emptive right with respect to such units, our percentage interest in Concord would be reduced accordingly. The Concord LLC Agreement also contains certain restrictions on our right to transfer our membership interests in Concord to third parties.
 
The New OEC Purchase Agreement 

On January 30, 2015, we entered into the Orbit Energy Charlotte, LLC Membership Interest Purchase Agreement by and among the Company, Orbit, Concord, and OEC (the “New OEC Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which (i) Concord purchased all of Orbit’s right, title and interest in and to the membership interests of OEC (the “OEC Interests”), (ii) Orbit abandoned all economic and ownership interest in the OEC Interests in favor of Concord, (iii) Orbit ceased to be a member of OEC and (iv) Concord was admitted as the sole member of OEC.
 
Under the Amended OEC Purchase Agreement and the New OEC Purchase Agreement, we had agreed to pay to Orbit the costs of evaluating and incorporating into the North Carolina project Orbit’s high solids anaerobic digestion technology and two HSAD Units designed by Orbit. Orbit was unable to design and install this technology into the North Carolina project, and we never paid or became obligated to pay any costs pursuant thereto. Instead, digesters designed and provided by Auspark LLC, the project’s engineering, procurement, construction and technology provider, have been incorporated into the North Carolina project.
 
The New OEC Purchase Agreement also carries forward from the Amended OEC Purchase Agreement our obligation to pay Orbit an amount equal to thirty percent (30%) of the North Carolina project’s distributable cash flow after we and the other equity investors in the North Carolina project fully recoup their respective investments in the North Carolina project (such investments to be calculated solely as amounts expended in and for the construction of the North Carolina project) and the North Carolina project achieves a thirty percent (30%) internal rate of return. The calculation of the project’s internal rate of return would take into account and be computed on the basis of any and all benefits from tax credits, depreciation and other incentives of any nature, as well as the OEC Management Fee.
 
On January 23, 2017, the Company and Orbit entered into an agreement to reduce certain of the Company’s obligations to Orbit under the Amended OEC Purchase Agreement and the New OEC Purchase Agreement, as set forth above (please refer to the above descriptions).
 
The Operations of the North Carolina project
OEC and Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (“Duke Energy”) are parties to an Amended and Restated Renewable Energy Purchase Agreement, dated October 12, 2012 and amended on April 25, 2013, January 31, 2014, January 20, 2015 and September 30, 2016 (as amended, the “Duke PPA”), pursuant to which OEC has agreed to sell, and Duke has agreed to purchase, the energy output of OEC’s facility, subject to the terms and conditions of the Duke PPA. Among other things, the Duke PPA required OEC to commence commercial operations by December 31, 2015 or, if not operational within 60 days of such date, pay Duke Energy $500,000 of liquidated damages, which would then extend the deadline for commercial operation to March 30, 2016. Since the commercial operations had not been commenced within 60 days of December 31, 2015, OEC was required to pay $500,000 of liquidated damages to Duke Energy pursuant to the Duke PPA during the first quarter of 2016, and York contributed these funds to OEC. The deadline for commercial operation was thereafter extended to November 23, 2016 by amendment to the Duke PPA. The Duke PPA is effective until August 21, 2030. The loss of Duke Energy as a customer of OEC could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
OEC is projected to require about 424 tons of organic feedstock on a daily basis and is working with organic waste suppliers to arrange supplies of feedstock. As of today, we have all definitive agreements signed to supply all feedstock needed for operation of the North Carolina project.
 
On November 18, 2016, the North Carolina project connected to the grid, commenced commercial operations and started to provide output to Duke Energy pursuant to the Duke PPA. The North Carolina facility is currently in the mechanical completion and ramp-up phase of the project. Commencement of the commercial operations includes the gradual intake of waste from the facility’s feedstock suppliers, increasing the parasitic load to the digesters, completing the waste-water-treatment resources and completing all other mechanical features needed for the facility to operate at full capacity. The Company estimates that the North Carolina project will be fully completed by the end of the second quarter of 2017.
 
As of December 31, 2016 equity earnings in the amount of $5,960,946 and Revenue from Services in the amount of $587,500 in 2016 with respect of the North Carolina project.

Our Rhode Island Project
 
The Amended OEC Purchase Agreement  
 On January 7, 2015, we signed an amended and restated purchase agreement with Orbit for the Rhode Island project (the “Amended OERI Purchase Agreement”). Subject to the terms of the Amended OERI Purchase Agreement, Orbit transferred full ownership of OERI to us in exchange for our agreeing to pay Orbit a development fee of $300,000, reimbursement of $86,432 of Orbit’s expenses, and an amount equal to 30% of the distributable cash flow from the Rhode Island project after the project achieves a post-recoupment 30% internal rate of return computed on the basis of any and all benefits from tax credits, depreciation and other incentives of any nature. We also agreed to use HSAD Units designed by Orbit and to retain Orbit to implement and operate the HSAD Units for an annual management fee of $187,500 (the “OERI Management Fee”), subject to certain conditions. The Amended OERI Purchase Agreement provided that we had until January 22, 2015 to pay Orbit the development fee and reimbursement amount, which was extended to February 28, 2015 in exchange for payment by us to Orbit of $31,000. We did not subsequently pay Orbit the development fee and reimbursement amount and, pursuant to the terms of the Amended OERI Purchase Agreement, ownership of OERI reverted back to Orbit.
Rhode Island Energy Partners, LLC  
 On April 8, 2015, (i) the Company, Rhode Island Energy Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Rhode Island”) and York entered into a development and indemnification agreement (the “Rhode Island Development and Indemnification Agreement”), pursuant to which Rhode Island paid us development fees of $1,541,900, issued us 2,275 Series B units of Rhode Island (“Rhode Island Series B Units), and issued 7,725 Series A units of Rhode Island (“Rhode Island Series A Units”) to York, and (ii) we and York entered into an amended and restated limited liability company operating agreement (the “Rhode Island LLC Agreement”) to establish the Rhode Island Series A Units and Rhode Island Series B Units and admit us and York as 22.75% and 77.25% members of Rhode Island, respectively. Pursuant to the foregoing agreements, York also agreed to fund Concord’s payment to us of us three equal installments of $562,500 upon (a) signing of the Rhode Island Development and Indemnification Agreement, (b) the later of (x) the date of mechanical completion of the Rhode Island project and (y) the date on which an executed interconnection agreement between OERI and National Grid, including receipt of any regulatory approvals from the Rhode Island Public Utility Commission, is delivered by OERI, and (c) commercial operation of the Rhode Island project. To date, York has made payment of the first $562,500 installment.
 
Pursuant to the Rhode Island LLC Agreement, our right to receive distributions from OERI are subject to certain priorities in favor of York, as follows:  
 
(a) | The amount of any excess profits from “feedstock tipping fees” shall be distributed with twenty percent (20%) going to York, and eighty percent (80%) going to us;

----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | Any amount remaining will be distributed pro-rata to us and York in proportion to York and our respective ownership in Rhode Island. 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Pursuant to the Rhode Island LLC Agreement, Rhode Island is managed by a board of managers initially consisting of three managers (the “Rhode Island Board”). So long as York owns more than 50% of the membership interests of Rhode Island, York is entitled to appoint two of the Rhode Island Board’s three managers. So long as we own no less than 50% of the membership interests of Rhode Island that we acquired pursuant to the Concord Development and Indemnification Agreement, we are entitled to appoint one manager of the Rhode Island Board. In the event that the Rhode Island Board determines in good faith that additional equity capital is needed by Rhode Island and is in the best interests of the Rhode Island project, the Rhode Island Board may determine the amount of additional capital needed and issue new units to raise the necessary funds.

The New OERI Purchase Agreement  
 On April 8, 2015, we entered into the Orbit Energy Rhode Island, LLC Membership Interest Purchase Agreement by and among the Company, Orbit, Rhode Island and OERI (the “New OERI Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which (i) Rhode Island purchased all of Orbit’s right, title and interest in and to the membership interests of OERI (the “OERI Interests”), (ii) Orbit abandoned all economic and ownership interest in the OERI Interests in favor of Rhode Island, (iii) Orbit ceased to me a member of OERI and (iv) Rhode Island was admitted as the sole member of OERI.
 
Under the Amended OERI Purchase Agreement and the New OERI Purchase Agreement, we had agreed to pay to Orbit the costs of evaluating and incorporating into the Rhode Island project Orbit’s high solids anaerobic digestion technology and two HSAD Units designed by Orbit. Orbit was unable to design and install this technology into the Rhode Island project, and we never paid or became obligated to pay any costs pursuant thereto. Instead, digesters designed and provided by Auspark LLC, the project’s engineering, procurement, construction and technology provider, have been incorporated into the Rhode Island project.
 
The New OERI Purchase Agreement also carries forward from the Amended OERI Purchase Agreement our obligation to pay Orbit an amount equal to thirty percent (30%) of the Rhode Island project’s distributable cash flow after we and the other equity investors in the Rhode Island project fully recoup our respective investments in the Rhode Island project (such investments to be calculated solely as amounts expended in and for the construction of the Rhode Island project) and the Rhode Island project achieves a thirty percent (30%) internal rate of return. The calculation of the project’s internal rate of return would take into account and be computed on the basis of any and all benefits from tax credits, depreciation and other incentives of any nature, as well as the OERI Management Fee.
 
On January 23, 2017, the Company and Orbit entered into an agreement to reduce certain of the Company’s obligations to Orbit under the Amended OERI Purchase Agreement and the New OERI Purchase Agreement, as set forth above (please refer to the above descriptions).
 
The Operations of the Rhode Island project  
 OERI and The Narragansett Electric Company d/b/a National Grid (“National Grid”) are parties to a Power Purchase Agreement, dated May 26, 2011 and amended on April 11, 2013, December 9, 2013, January 9, 2015 and May 27, 2016 (as amended, the “National Grid PPA”), pursuant to which OERI has agreed to sell, and National Grid has agreed to purchase, the energy output of OERI’s facility, subject to the terms and conditions of the National Grid PPA. Among other things, the National Grid PPA required OERI to commence commercial operations by December 31, 2015, which could be extended up to six months by OERI upon deposit of $22,500 of collateral. Since commercial operations were not commenced by December 31, 2015, OERI paid an additional “Development Period Security” of $22,500 pursuant to the National Grid PPA, such funds having been contributed to OERI by York. On May 27 2016, National Grid agreed to modify the date to commence commercial operations to June 30, 2017. As an incentive and evidence of good faith to achieve commercial operation, OERI posted additional collateral in the amount of $22,500, such funds having been contributed to OERI by York. The National Grid PPA is effective for 15 years from the date commercial operations are commenced, which may be extended by 6 years at the option of National Grid. The loss of National Grid as a customer of OERI could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
OERI has obtained all the required permits, except for the operating permit, to achieve commercial operation. Although no assurances can be given, we expect the Rhode Island project to commence commercial operations on or before the modified date to commence commercial operations, or June 30, 2017.
 
OERI and Renewable Organics Management LLC are parties to an Organic Waste Delivery Agreement, dated October 13, 2016, in respect of 80,000 tons per year of organic feedstock. This agreement has a five-year term, subject to renewal, and begins upon commencement of operations, at which time feedstock will be supplied to the Rhode Island project. OERI is projected to require 80,000 tons per year of organic feedstock on a daily basis, so the quantity represented by this agreement is expected to satisfy 100% of facility’s feedstock requirements for operations.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we have recorded deferred revenue Deferred revenues from nonconsolidated affiliates in the amount of $5,658,169 with respect to our project in the Rhode Island project (which will be recorded as revenue upon the commencement of its commercial operations.

Our Italy Projects
 
The Acquisition of Our Italy Projects 
On May 14, 2015, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Italy Projects Agreement”) with Volteo Energie S.p.A., Agriholding S.r.l., and Overland S.r.l. (each, a “Seller” and collectively, the “Sellers”) through our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Bluesphere Italy S.r.l. (we subsequently changed the name of Bluesphere Italy S.r.l to Bluesphere Pavia S.r.l (“Blue Sphere Pavia”), which is the name we use herein). Pursuant to the Italy Projects Agreement, we agreed to purchase one hundred percent (100%) of the share capital of Agricerere S.r.l., Agrielektra S.r.l., Agrisorse S.r.l. and Gefa S.r.l (each, an “SPV” and collectively, the “SPVs”) from the Sellers, who collectively held all of the outstanding share capital of each SPV. Each SPV is engaged in the owning and operating of an anaerobic digestion biogas plant for the production and sale of electricity to Gestore del Servizi Energetici GSE, S.p.A., a state-owned company, pursuant to a power purchase agreement. All references to, and descriptions of, the Italy Projects Agreement incorporate the terms of an amendment to the same entered into by the parties on December 14, 2015.
 
Pursuant to the Italy Projects Agreement, the we agreed to pay an aggregate purchase price of €5,600,000 for all of the SPVs, which, less certain credits applied, has adjusted to $5,646,628 (€5,200,000) (the “Purchase Price”). Fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Price, less certain credits, was due to the Sellers on the Closing Date and the remaining balance along with annual interest rate of two percent (2%) (“the deferred payment”), less certain credits, is due to the Sellers on the third anniversary of the Closing Date. The Purchase Price is subject to certain adjustments and to an adjustment based on the actual EBITDA results in the 18 months following the Closing Date, per the following mechanism:  
 
(a) | If the actual EBITDA in the 18 months following the Closing Date divided by 1.5 is greater than € 934,519, then the deferred payment shall be increased by the amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the difference. 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | If the actual EBITDA in the 18 months following the Closing Date divided by 1.5 is lesser than € 934,519, then the deferred payment shall be reduced by the amount of the amount necessary to maintain a Purchase Price that yields an Equity IRR of twenty-five percent (25%), but not more than 35% of the remaining balance. 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under the Italy Projects agreement, EBITDA is defined as “total cash revenues received minus all cash expenditures made during the relevant period excluding principle and interest payments due to the bank and taxes”.
 
Pursuant to the Italy Projects Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Sellers the VAT amount that was requested and will be requested by the SPVs for the fiscal year of 2014. The reimbursed amount will not exceed €1,160,425 and will be refunded to the Sellers only after the amount is refunded to the Blue Sphere Pavia by the VAT authorities in Italy. Pursuant to the Italy Projects Agreement, we also issued a corporate guarantee to the Sellers, whereby the Company will secure the obligations of Blue Sphere Pavia under the Italy Projects Agreement.
 
On December 14, 2015 (the “Closing Date”), pursuant to the Italy Projects Agreement, we completed the acquisitions of one hundred percent (100%) of the share capital of the “SPVs. On the Closing Date, the Company paid an amount of $2,143,181 (€1,952,858), which represented fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Price adjusted for certain post-closing adjustments and closing costs. The remaining balance of of the Purchase Price (balance less the adjusted closing payment) is promised by a note accruing interest at an annual rate of two percent (2%) to each Seller, with such principal and interest accrued due to each Seller on or before the third anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to adjustment to the variation of EBITDA, as described above. The portion of the Purchase Price and closing costs paid at closing was primarily financed by a loan of €2,900,000, obtained pursuant to the Helios Loan Agreement. 


The closing of the Italy Projects Agreement was subject to certain conditions precedent including, but not limited to, obtaining consent to the proposed sale and resulting change of control from Banca IMI S.p.A. (“the SVPs’ lender”) in connection with a certain Financing Agreement, dated February 25, 2013, between the SPVs, Banca IMI S.p.A. and Intesa San Paolo S.p.A, as well as from other counterparties to certain agreements to which the SVPs are a party. After the Closing Date, the SPV’s paid a waiver fee of approximately $109,000 to the SVPs’ lender, such amount representing 50% of the fees and expenses charged by the lenders in connection with obtaining these consents.

The Operations of the Italy Projects  
 On July 17, 2015, we entered into a Framework EBITDA Guarantee Agreement (the “Framework EBITDA Agreement”) with Austep S.p.A. (“Austep”), an Italian corporation. Austep specializes in the design, construction, operation and servicing of anaerobic digestion plants. The Framework EBITDA Agreement provides a framework pursuant to which Austep will perform technical analyses of operating anaerobic digestion plants in Italy that we identify as potential acquisition targets. If and when we acquire such anaerobic digestion plants in Italy, subject to the terms of the Framework EBITDA Agreement, we and Austep have agreed to negotiate individual agreements pursuant to which Austep will operate, maintain and supervise each plant and guarantee agreed-upon levels of EBITDA to us for a specified period. The Framework EBITDA Agreement will apply to the first fifteen anaerobic digestion plants that we may acquire in Italy, including the plants subject to the Italy Projects Agreement.
 
On the Closing Date, each SPV entered into Plant EBITDA Guarantee Agreement with Austep (collectively, the “Plant EBITDA Agreements”). In accordance with the Plant EBITDA Agreements, Austep will operate, maintain and supervise each biogas plant owned by the SPVs. In addition, the Plant EBITDA Agreements guaranteed a monthly aggregate EBITDA of $204,147 (€188,000) from the four SPVs, collectively, for the initial six months following the Closing Date, and thereafter the Plant EBITDA Agreements guarantee an annual aggregate EBITDA of $4,082,946 (€3,760,000) from the four SPVs, collectively. Pursuant to the terms of the Plant EBITDA Agreements, the Company will receive the guaranteed levels of EBITDA, and Austep will receive ninety percent (90%) of the revenue in excess of such levels.
 
The Helios Loan Agreement  
 On August 18, 2015, we and two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Eastern Sphere Ltd. (“Eastern Sphere”), the parent of Blue Sphere Pavia, and Blue Sphere Pavia, entered into a Long Term Mezzanine Loan Agreement (the “Helios Loan Agreement”) with Helios Italy Bio-Gas 1 L.P. (“Helios”) to finance the Italy Projects Agreement. Under the Helios Loan Agreement, Helios made up to five million euros (€5,000,000) available to Blue Sphere Pavia (the “Helios Loan”) to finance (a) ninety percent (90%) of the total required investment of the first four SPVs acquired, (b) seventy to eighty percent (70-80%) of the total required investment of up to three SPVs subsequently acquired, if applicable, (c) certain broker fees incurred in connection with the acquisitions, and (d) any taxes associated with registration of an equity pledge agreement (as described below). Each financing of an SPV acquisition will be subject to specified conditions precedent and will constitute a separate loan under the Helios Loan Agreement. Helios’s obligation to provide additional funds under the Helios Loan Agreement, in connection with subsequently acquired SPVs, terminated on June 30, 2016.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance under the Helios Loan was $2,607,000. Subject to specified terms, representations and warranties, the Helios Loan Agreement provides that each loan thereunder will accrue interest at a rate of fourteen and one-half percent (14.5%) per annum, and that Helios is entitled to an annual operation fee of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per annum. Payments of principal, interest and the operation fee are due and payable quarterly. The final payment for each loan will become due no later than the earlier of (a) thirteen and one half years from the date such loan was made available to Blue Sphere Pavia, and (b) the date that the license to produce electricity granted to the relevant SVP expires. Pursuant to the Helios Loan Agreement and an equity pledge agreement, We pledged all our shares in Blue Sphere Pavia to secure all loan amounts utilized under the Helios Loan Agreement.


On December 2015, we borrowed €2,900,000 ($3,149,000) under the Helios Loan Agreement to finance the purchase of the SPVs. No additional funds have since been borrowed.

Strategy
 
Our main focus is providing tailored solutions internationally to produce clean energy primarily out of the treatment of waste. We are focused on waste-to-energy projects in the United States, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Israel and are in the process of developing a pipeline of similar projects. We believe there is a virtually endless supply of waste suitable for such projects and the demand for energy (particularly from such projects) is growing consistently.
 
Our model is to acquire or build, own and operate waste-to-energy facilities. We select projects with signed, long-term agreements with waste producers or waste haulers for feedstock, with national governments or electricity corporations for energy output and with private entities for the sale of other project by-products (such as renewable energy credits, heat, compost and fertilizer). We are currently evaluating several types of projects: (i) anaerobic digestion to electricity, (ii) landfill gas to energy, (iii) anaerobic digestion to renewable natural gas, (iv) biomass to electricity, (v) energy crop to electricity, (vi) pyrolysis to electricity and thermal and (vii) incineration to electricity.
 
A component of the clean energy and waste-to-energy industry in the United States is renewable energy credits (“RECs”). A REC represents a MWh or KWh of clean energy. Many states, including North Carolina and Rhode Island, the sites of our two United States projects, require their utilities to prove that a portion of the energy they sell is produced from clean or renewable sources. A REC is used to demonstrate that the relevant unit of energy has a clean or renewable source. Consequently, utilities purchase RECs from producers of clean and renewable energy. Our agreements with Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (“Duke Energy”) and The Narragansett Electric Company d/b/a National Grid (“National Grid”), for our North Carolina and Rhode Island projects, respectively, provide for “bundled” pricing for the sale of electricity and RECs.
 
We expect to generate revenue through sales of thermal and electrical energy, energy efficiency technologies and RECs, and by-products, project development services, and tipping fees from accepting waste. On November 18, 2016, our project in the Charlotte, NC Waste to Energy Anaerobic Digester 5.2 MW Plant commenced commercial operations and started to provide its output to Duke Energy pursuant to the power purchase agreement with Duke Energy. The commencement of the commercial operations includes the gradual intake of waste from the facility’s feedstock suppliers, increasing the parasitic load to the digesters, completing the waste-water-treatment resources and completing all other mechanical features needed for the facility to operate at full capacity. As of December 31, 2016, the facility is in its mechanical completion and ramp-up phase of the project. We estimate that this project will be fully completed by April 30, 2017.
 
Our strategy is to integrate all activities and components that make up a waste-to-energy project and provide a turn-key, one-stop shop solution for waste-to-energy development. We are also actively seeking to acquire facilities that are in various stages of development. We work with and outsource key components of our projects to engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) providers and other project participants that provide the most economically viable solution for each individual project. The EPC providers may also be the provider of the technology used for each project. We The EPC providers may also be the provider of the technology used for each project. We believe this provides us the flexibility and freedom to tailor the best solution for each project. We expect that we will remain involved in managing and financing all aspects of our projects throughout their lifetimes or until they are sold. We believe this assures all of the involved stakeholders, including waste producers, financing stakeholders, EPC and technology providers, and customers, that there is long-term continuity and responsibility for each project.
 
We aim to be distinctive and successful in the waste-to-energy market by:
 

● | providing a one-stop, turn-key/build, own and operate/transfer solution; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | identifying and obtaining the rights to lucrative projects without incurring material expense; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delivering seamless and professional project implementation through a combination of our own expertise and the use of third-party experts with a track-record of success; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | being technology agnostic and using mature and well-known technologies and when necessary to tailor-make cost-efficient and effective solutions for our projects; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | leveraging our management’s more than 30 years of experience in successful implementation of large and complex projects in the developing world; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | building local and international teams to support each project; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtaining political, property, non-performance and insolvency insurance for our projects; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | receiving almost all of our revenue in United States dollars or euros, whether operating in the United States, Europe or the developing world.

Competition
 
There are a number of other companies operating in the clean energy and waste-to-energy space, ranging from other project developers to service or equipment providers, buyers and/or investors. Unlike the common market approach in this space (i.e., being solely a project developer, service or equipment provider or a buyer or investor), we seek to provide a one-stop shop, turn-key solution for project development and operation. As described above, our business model is to acquire or develop and manage all aspects of project implementation and sales of the project’s clean energy and by-products. We believe this integrated approach is attractive to project stakeholders and will differentiate us in a positive manner from our competition. We are aware of several competitors in the United States, such as – Harvest Power, Neo Energy, Anaergia, Quasar, CH4 and others. We value these companies, as they are helping to create awareness and credibility for the waste-to-energy space. However, companies in the waste-to-energy industry tend to focus on new or singular technologies, whereas we believe that we have a competitive advantage in being technology agnostic. By having our own technology experts, we are able to focus on finding the best locations where waste is abundant and implementing the best technology for that particular waste stream.
 
The clean energy and waste-to-energy space is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Many of our competitors and other companies operating in this space have greater financial and other resources than we have. As a result, these companies may be more effective in developing and implementing a business model similar to ours and/or competing with us in any aspect of project implementation and clean energy sales.
 
Government Regulation
 
Permitting
 
Each of our projects in development requires certain government approvals. In the United States, the standard required environmental permits relate to solid waste composting and air quality. All construction and operational permits for our North Carolina and Rhode Island projects have been obtained, except for the operating permit to achieve commercial operation for our Rhode Island project. In Italy, all permits for operation of the projects have been received, and these projects are operational.
Effect of Existing or Probable Government Regulations on Our Business
 
Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations on the international, federal, state and local levels, including energy, environmental, conservation, tax and other laws and regulations relating to our industry. Failure to comply with any laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of injunctive relief or both. Moreover, changes in any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to current and future laws and regulations, including their applicability to us, we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on our future operations.
 
We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and enforcement of such laws and regulations have no more restrictive an effect on our operations than on other similar companies in our industry. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to comply with international, federal and state environmental requirements.
 
Employees
 
We have eleven full-time basis professionals: our non-executive chairman, chief executive officer, two executive vice-presidents, chief technical officer, chief financial officer, controller for European operations, vice president of strategy and business development, vice president investor relations, operation manager for the United States market and vice president of business development for the United States market. We also employ one part-time office manager. Our subsidiary, Eastern Sphere, has two full-time employees, our vice president of business development for the European market and our executive vice president of mergers and acquisitions.
