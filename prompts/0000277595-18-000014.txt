Narrative Description of Business

• | Oil and Natural Gas Operations

General: Energen’s operations focus on increasing production and adding proved reserves through the development of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas properties. In addition, Energen explores for and develops new reservoirs, primarily in areas in which it has an operating presence. All oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production is sold to third parties. Energen operates its properties for its own interest and that of its joint interest owners. This role includes overall project management and day-to-day decision-making relative to project operations.
At the end of 2017, Energen’s proved reserves totaled 444 MMBOE. Substantially all of these proved reserves are located in the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico. Approximately 57 percent of Energen’s year-end proved reserves are proved developed reserves. Energen’s proved reserves have a year-end proved reserves-to-production ratio of 16 years. Oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas represent approximately 58 percent, 20 percent and 22 percent, respectively, of Energen’s proved reserves.
Property Acquisitions and Dispositions: During 2017, Energen completed a total of $273.3 million in various purchases and renewals of unproved acquisitions, which are accounted for as asset acquisitions, including approximately $217.4 million in the Delaware Basin and approximately $36.9 million in the Midland Basin for unproved leasehold and $19.0 million for mineral purchases primarily in the Delaware Basin. Energen completed an estimated $143.7 million in various purchases and renewals of unproved leasehold largely in the Permian Basin, including approximately $77 million of acreage purchased in Lea County, New Mexico, during 2016. Energen completed an estimated total of $85.7 million in various purchases of unproved leasehold largely in the Permian Basin during 2015. 
During 2016, Energen completed a series of asset sales of certain non-core Permian Basin assets in the Delaware Basin in Texas and in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico for an aggregate purchase price of $552 million. These transactions had closing dates of June 3, 7, 30, July 15 and August 9 of 2016 with various effective dates ranging from March 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016. Minor portions of the assets were transferred to other parties upon the exercise of preferential purchase rights under pre-existing joint operating agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pre-tax proceeds to Energen were approximately $532.2 million after purchase price adjustments of approximately $19 million related to the operations of the properties subsequent to the effective dates and other one-time adjustments including transfer payments and certain amounts due the buyer, but before consideration of transaction costs of approximately $5 million. In the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Energen recognized pre-tax post-closing adjustment losses of $0.6 million and pre-tax gains of $246.3 million, respectively, on the sales. Energen used the proceeds from the sale to fund ongoing operations.

In March 2015, Energen completed the sale of the majority of its natural gas assets in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and Colorado (effective as of January 1, 2015) for an aggregate purchase price of $395 million. The sales proceeds were reduced by purchase price adjustments of approximately $11 million related to the operations of the San Juan Basin properties subsequent to December 31, 2014 and one-time adjustments related primarily to liabilities assumed by the buyer, which resulted in pre-tax proceeds to Energen of approximately $384 million before consideration of transaction costs of approximately $2.8 million. Energen recognized a pre-tax gain of $27.0 million on the sale. Energen used the proceeds from the sale to reduce long-term indebtedness. 
Growth Strategy: Energen is focused on increasing its oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production and proved reserves largely through active development and/or exploratory programs in the Permian Basin. The Company seeks to expand its footprint primarily through acquisitions of proved properties and unproved leasehold within areas of existing operations. Energen operated approximately 97 percent of its proved reserves at December 31, 2017. 
Energen’s capital spending plans for 2018 target an investment ranging from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion (excluding acquisitions), the bulk of which will focus on drilling and development activities on its existing properties, all targeting the liquids-rich Permian Basin. Energen may choose to allocate additional capital during the year for property acquisitions and/or increased drilling and development activities. 
Energen’s development activities can result in the addition of new proved reserves and can serve to reclassify proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Proved reserve disclosures are provided annually, although changes to reserve classifications occur throughout the year. Accordingly, additions of new proved reserves from development activities can occur throughout the year and may result from numerous factors including, but not limited to, regulatory approvals for drilling unit downspacing that increase the number of available drilling locations; changes in the economic or operating environments that allow previously uneconomic locations to be added; technological advances that make reserve locations available for development; successful development of existing proved undeveloped reserve locations that reclassify adjacent probable locations to proved undeveloped reserve locations; increased knowledge of field geology and engineering parameters relative to oil and natural gas reservoirs; and changes in management’s intent to develop certain opportunities.
During the three years ended December 31, 2017, Energen’s development and exploratory efforts have added 312 MMBOE of proved reserves. During the same period, we drilled 405 gross development, exploratory and service wells (including one sidetrack well) and 26 well recompletions and pay-adds. In 2017, Energen’s successful development and exploratory wells and other activities added approximately 115.5 MMBOE of proved reserves; Energen drilled 128 gross development, exploratory and service wells, performed 1 well recompletion and pay-add, and conducted other operational enhancements. Energen’s production totaled 27.8 MMBOE in 2017. In 2018, production is estimated to range from 33.4 MMBOE to 36 MMBOE, with a midpoint of 34.7 MMBOE, including approximately 27.8 MMBOE of estimated production from proved reserves owned at December 31, 2017. Production estimates do not include amounts for potential acquisitions.
Drilling Activity: The following table sets forth the total number of net productive and dry exploratory and development wells drilled:

Years ended December 31, | 2017 | 2016 | 2015
Development: | | | 
Productive | 9.6 | | 18.5 | 50.8 
Dry | — | | — | — 
Total | 9.6 | | 18.5 | 50.8 
Exploratory: | | | 
Productive | 71.9 | | 53.2 | 98.5 
Dry | 0.9 | | — | 2.0 
Total | 72.8 | | 53.2 | 100.5

Included in the 2017 net wells drilled above are 17 gross (16 net) drilled but uncompleted wells in the Midland Basin and 13 gross (12 net) drilled but uncompleted wells in the Delaware Basin, all of which we plan to complete in 2018. Included in the 2016 net wells drilled above are 42 gross (41 net) drilled but uncompleted wells in the Midland Basin and 17 gross (17 net) drilled but uncompleted wells in the Delaware Basin, all of which we completed in 2017. Included in the 2015 net wells drilled above are 2 gross (2 net) drilled but uncompleted wells in the Midland Basin, which we completed in 2017. As of December 
 8

31, 2017, Energen was participating in the drilling of 4 gross (4 net) development and 9 gross (5 net) exploratory wells. In addition to the development wells drilled, Energen drilled 10.0, 3.0 and 12.9 net service wells during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Energen had no gross service wells in process as of December 31, 2017. 
Productive Wells and Acreage: The following table sets forth the total gross and net productive gas and oil wells as of December 31, 2017, and developed and undeveloped acreage as of the latest practicable date prior to year end:

 | Gross | Net 
Oil wells | 4,987 | 3,425 
Gas wells | 131 | 22 
Developed acreage | 333,631 | 230,545
Undeveloped acreage | 67,574 | 35,707 

There were no wells with multiple completions at December 31, 2017. All wells and acreage are located onshore in the United States, with the majority of the net undeveloped acreage located in Texas and New Mexico.
Concentration of Credit Risk: Revenues and related accounts receivable from oil and natural gas operations primarily are generated from the sale of produced oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas to energy marketing companies. Such sales are typically made on an unsecured credit basis with payment due the month following delivery. This concentration of sales to the energy marketing industry has the potential to affect Energen’s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas purchasers may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Energen considers the credit quality of its purchasers and, in certain instances, may require credit assurances such as a deposit, letter of credit or parent guarantee. The two largest purchasers of Energen’s oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, Plains Marketing, LP (Plains) and Shell Trading (US) Company (Shell), accounted for approximately 50 percent and 18 percent, respectively, of Energen’s accounts receivable for commodity sales as of December 31, 2017. Energen’s other purchasers each accounted for less than 7 percent of these accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Plains and Shell accounted for approximately 56 percent and 13 percent, respectively, of total revenues from oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas sales. All other oil and natural gas purchasers each accounted for less than 10 percent of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Risk Management: Energen attempts to lower the commodity price risk associated with its oil and natural gas business through the use of swaps and basis swaps. Energen has policies in place to limit hedging to not more than 80 percent of its estimated annual production; however, Energen’s credit facility contains a covenant that operates to limit hedging at a lower threshold in certain circumstances. Energen recognizes all derivatives on the balance sheet and measures all derivatives at fair value. 
See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements preceding Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion with respect to price and other risks.

• | Environmental Matters and Climate Change

Various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to the operations of Energen. Historically, the cost of environmental compliance has not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. New regulations, enforcement policies, claims for damages or other events could result in significant unanticipated costs. 
Federal, state and local legislative bodies and agencies frequently exercise their respective authority to adopt new laws and regulations and to amend and interpret existing laws and regulations. Such law and regulation changes may occur with little prior notification, subject Energen to cost increases, and impose restrictions and limitations on our operations. Examples of law and regulatory changes with the potential to materially impact Energen include, but are not limited to, measures dealing with hydraulic fracturing, emission limits and reporting and the repeal of certain oil and natural gas tax incentives and deductions. 
Energen regularly utilizes hydraulic fracturing in its drilling and completion activities. Energen’s first widespread use of hydraulic fracturing occurred during the 1980s in conjunction with the exploration and development of coalbed methane in Alabama’s Black Warrior Basin. 
Hydraulic fracturing is a reservoir stimulation technique used throughout the oil and natural gas industry for more than 60 years. After a well has been drilled, hydraulic fracturing is used during the completion process to form small fractures in the target formation through which the oil and/or natural gas can flow. The fractures are created when a water-based fluid is pumped 
 9

at a calculated rate and pressure into the crude oil- or natural gas-bearing rock. The fracture fluid is a mixture composed primarily of water and sand or inert ceramic, sand-like grains; it also contains a small percentage of special purpose chemical additives (which are highly diluted-typically less than one percent by volume) that can vary by project. The millimeter-thick cracks or fractures in the target formation are propped open by the sand, thereby allowing the crude oil or natural gas to flow from tight (low permeability) reservoirs into the well bore. 
States in which we operate have adopted a variety of well construction, set back, and disclosure regulations limiting how drilling can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical and water usage disclosure for operators that employ hydraulic fracturing. We are complying with these additional regulations as part of our routine operations and within the normal execution of our business plan. The adoption of additional federal or state regulations, however, could impose significant new costs and challenges. For example, adoption of new hydraulic fracturing permitting requirements could significantly delay or prevent new drilling. Adoption of new regulatory restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and gas able to be recovered from our proved reserves. The degree to which additional oil and natural gas industry regulation may impact our future operations and results will depend on the extent to which we utilize the regulated activity and whether the geographic locations in which we operate are subject to the new regulation.
Existing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations also have the potential to increase costs, reduce liquidity, delay operations and otherwise alter business operations. These existing laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; Oil Pollution Prevention: Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure regulations; Toxic Substances Control Act; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Federal Endangered Species Act. Compliance with these and other environmental laws and regulations is undertaken as part of Energen’s routine operations. Energen does not separately track costs associated with these routine compliance activities.
Climate change, whether arising through natural occurrences or human activities, may have a significant impact upon the operations of Energen. Volatile weather patterns and the resulting environmental impact may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are unable to predict the timing or manifestation of climate change or reliably estimate the impact to Energen. However, climate change could affect our operations as follows:

• | sustained increases or decreases to the supply and demand of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas;


• | potential disruption to third-party facilities to which Energen delivers. Such facilities include third-party oil and gas gathering, transportation, processing and storage facilities and are typically limited in number and geographically concentrated.

During January 2014, Energen Resources responded to a General Notice and Information Request from the Environmental Protection Agency regarding the Reef Environmental Site (the Site) in Sylacauga, Talladega County, Alabama. The letter identifies Energen Resources as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 for the cleanup of the Site. In 2008, Energen hired a third party to transport approximately 3,000 gallons of non-hazardous wastewater to Reef Environmental for wastewater treatment. Reef Environmental ceased operating its wastewater treatment system in 2010. Because it used Reef Environmental only one time for a small volume of non-hazardous wastewater, Energen Resources has not accrued a liability for cleanup of the Site.

• | Employees

The Company has approximately 390 employees. Energen believes that its relations with its employees are good.
