  ITEM 1- BUSINESS
  
  General
  
 FieldPoint Petroleum Corporation, a Colorado corporation (the “Company”), was formed on March 11, 1980, to acquire and enhance mature oil and natural gas field production in the mid-continent and the Rocky Mountain regions. Since 1980, the Company had engaged in oil and natural gas operations and, in 1986, divested all oil and natural gas assets and operations. From December 1986, until its reverse acquisition on December 31, 1997, the Company did not engage in oil and natural gas operations. Since the reverse acquisition on December 31, 1997 the Company has been in the oil and natural gas exploration and production business.
 Business Strategy
  
 The Company’s business strategy is to continue to expand its reserve base and increase production and cash flow through the acquisition of producing oil and natural gas properties. Such acquisitions will be based on an analysis of the properties' current cash flow and the Company's ability to profit from the acquisition. The Company's ideal acquisition will include not only oil and natural gas production, but also leasehold and other working interests in exploration areas.
  

 The Company will also seek to identify promising areas for the exploration of oil and natural gas through the use of outside consultants and the expertise of the Company. This identification will include collecting and analyzing geological and geophysical data for exploration areas. Once promising properties are identified, the Company will attempt to acquire the properties either for drilling oil and natural gas wells, using independent contractors for drilling operations, or for sale to third parties.

 The Company recognizes that the ability to implement its business strategies is largely dependent on the ability to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund future acquisition, exploration, drilling and development activities. The Company's capital resources are discussed more thoroughly in Part II, Item 7, in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
  
  Operations
  
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company had varying ownership interest in 462 gross wells (112.19 net) located in five states. The Company operates 14 of the 462 wells; the other wells are operated by independent operators under contracts that are standard in the industry. It is a primary objective of the Company to operate some of the oil and natural gas properties in which it has an economic interest, and the Company will also partner with larger oil and natural gas companies to operate certain oil and natural gas properties in which the Company has an economic interest. The Company believes, with the responsibility and authority as operator, it is in a better position to control cost, safety, and timeliness of work as well as other critical factors affecting the economics of a well.
 Market for Oil and Natural Gas
  
 The demand for oil and natural gas is dependent upon a number of factors, including the availability of other domestic production, crude oil imports, the proximity and size of oil and natural gas pipelines in general, other transportation facilities, the marketing of competitive fuels, and general fluctuations in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas. The Company intends to sell all of its production to traditional industry purchasers, such as pipeline and crude oil companies, who have facilities to transport the oil and natural gas from the well site.
 Competition
  
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive in all aspects. The Company competes with major oil companies, numerous independent oil and natural gas producers, individual proprietors, and investment programs. Many of these competitors possess financial and personnel resources substantially in excess of those which are available to the Company and may, therefore, be able to pay greater amounts for desirable leases and define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of potential producing prospects that the Company's own resources permit. The Company’s ability to generate resources will depend not only on its ability to develop existing properties but also on its ability to identify and acquire proven and unproven acreage and prospects for further exploration.
 Hydraulic Fracturing
  
 Hydraulic fracturing is an important process and has been commonly used in the completion of unconventional oil and gas wells in shale and tight sand formations since the 1950s. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and gas production. It is important to us because it provides access to oil and gas reserves that previously were uneconomical to produce.
  
 We currently use hydraulic fracturing to complete both horizontal and vertical wells in the Permian Basin. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing services to us for completion of these wells. While hydraulic fracturing is not required to maintain our leasehold acreage that is currently held by production from existing wells, it will likely be required in the future to develop the proved non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves associated with this acreage. All of our proved non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves associated with future drilling, completion and recompletion projects will probably require hydraulic fracturing.

 We believe we have followed, and intend to continue to follow, applicable industry standard practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our operations that are subject to supervision by state regulators.
  
 These protective measures include setting surface casing at a depth sufficient to protect fresh water zones as determined by applicable state regulatory agencies, and cementing the well to create a permanent isolating barrier between the casing pipe and surrounding geological formations. This aspect of well design is intended to prevent contact between the fracturing fluid and any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations. For recompletions of existing wells, the production casing is pressure-tested before perforating the new completion interval.
 
 Injection rates and pressures are monitored at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. We believe we have adequate procedures in place to address abrupt changes to the injection pressure or annular pressure.
 
 Texas regulations currently require disclosure of the components in the solutions used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Over 99% (by mass) of the ingredients we use in hydraulic fracturing are water and sand. The remainder of the ingredients are chemical additives that are managed and used in accordance with applicable requirements.
 
 Hydraulic fracturing requires the use of a significant amount of water. Upon flowback of the water, we dispose of it in a way that we believe minimizes the impact to nearby surface water by disposing into approved disposal facilities or injection wells. Currently our primary sources of water are nonpotable and potable aquifers. We use water from on-lease water wells that we have drilled, and we purchase water from off-lease water wells. We also plan to reuse and recycle flow-back and produced water in 2016.
  
  Operational Hazards and Insurance
  
 The Company's operations are subject to the usual hazards incident to the drilling and production of oil and natural gas, such as blowouts, cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations.
  
 The Company maintains insurance of various types to cover its operations. The Company's insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with the drilling and production of oil and natural gas. In particular, coverage is not obtainable for certain types of environmental hazards. The occurrence of a significant adverse event, the risks of which are not fully covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers reasonable.
  
  Regulation
  
 The oil and gas industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities. At the federal level, various federal rules, regulations and procedures apply, including those issued by the U.S. Department of Interior, the U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) (Office of Pipeline Safety) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). At the state and local level, various agencies and commissions regulate drilling, production and midstream activities. These federal, state and local authorities have various permitting, licensing and bonding requirements. Various remedies are available for enforcement of these federal, state and local rules, regulations and procedures, including fines, penalties, revocation of permits and licenses, actions affecting the value of leases, wells or other assets, and suspension of production. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not incur liability for fines, penalties or other remedies that are available to these federal, state and local authorities. However, we believe that we are currently in material compliance with federal, state and local rules, regulations and procedures, and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

  Transportation and Sale of Oil
  
 Sales of crude oil and condensate are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. Interstate transportation of oil by pipeline is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulation Commission (“FERC”) pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), Energy Policy Act of 1992 (“EPAct 1992”), and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport crude oil and refined products, be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory and that such rates, terms and conditions of service be filed with FERC.
  
 Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are also subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state-to-state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
  
 Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors.
 
 The transportation of oil by truck is also subject to federal, state and local rules and regulations, including the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act and the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Regulations under these statutes cover the security and transportation of hazardous materials and are administered by the DOT.
  
  Transportation and Sale of Natural Gas and NGLs
  
 FERC regulates interstate gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and regulations issued under those statutes. FERC also regulates interstate NGL pipelines under various federal laws and regulations. Although FERC does not regulate oil and gas producers such as us, FERC’s actions are intended to facilitate increased competition within all phases of the oil and gas industry and its regulation of third-party pipelines and facilities could indirectly affect our ability to transport or market our production. To date, FERC’s policies have not materially affected our business or operations.
  
  Regulation of Production
  
 Oil, NGL and gas production is regulated under a wide range of federal and state statutes, rules, orders and regulations. State and federal statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states in which we operate, have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, the regulation of spacing, and requirements for plugging and abandonment of wells. Also, some states, including Texas imposes a severance tax on production and sales of oil, NGLs and gas within its jurisdiction. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.

  Environmental Laws and Regulations
  
 In the United States, the exploration for and development of oil and gas and the drilling and operation of wells, fields and gathering systems are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:
  
  ●
  require the acquisition of various permits before drilling begins;

 
  ●
  require the installation of expensive pollution controls or emissions monitoring equipment;

 
  ●
  restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and gas drilling, completion, production, transportation and processing activities;

 
  ●
  suspend, limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities in certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, endangered species habitat, and other protected areas; and

 
  ●
  require remedial measures to mitigate and remediate pollution from historical and ongoing operations, such as the closure of waste pits and plugging of abandoned wells.


 These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability.
 
 Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with environmental laws, regulations and permits, and violations are subject to injunction, as well as administrative, civil and criminal penalties. The effects of existing and future laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretations of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, accidental releases or spills and ground water contamination may occur in the course of our operations, and we may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases, spills or contamination, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. We maintain insurance against costs of clean-up operations, but we are not fully insured against all such risks. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with current requirements would not have a material adverse effect on us, there is no assurance that this will continue in the future.
 
 The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business operations.
  
  Hazardous Substance Release
  
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. While we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances, we have not received notification that we may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA.

  Waste Handling
  
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Any such change could increase our operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
  
 We currently own or lease properties that for many years have been used for oil and gas exploration, production and development activities. Although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed of or released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on, under or from other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes was not under our control. These properties and the materials disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or contamination, or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.

  Air Emissions
  
 The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions at specified sources. In particular, on April 18, 2012, the EPA issued new regulations under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”). The regulations are designed to reduce volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from hydraulically-fractured natural gas wells, storage tanks and other equipment. Since January 1, 2015, all newly fractured natural gas wells must use green completion technology, which allows for the recovery of natural gas that formerly would have been vented or flared. We do believe that the NSPS or NESHAP have had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. We believe that we currently are in substantial compliance with all air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our current operations.
 Greenhouse Gas Emissions
  
 Congress has, from time-to-time, considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). The current Congress is likely to continue to consider similar bills. Moreover, almost half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs or other mechanisms. Most cap-and-trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. As the number of GHG emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly. Many states have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources.
 
 In response to the findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA has adopted two sets of rules regarding possible future regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one of which purports to regulate emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and the other of which would regulate emissions of GHGs from large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities. The motor vehicle rule was finalized in April 2010 and became effective in January 2011, but it does not require immediate reductions in GHG emissions. In March 2012, the EPA proposed GHG emissions standards for fossil fuel-powered electric utility generating units that would require new plants to meet an output-based standard of 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per megawatt-hour. If the proposed regulation is adopted, it could have a significant impact on the electrical generation industry and may favor the use of natural gas over other fossil fuels such as coal in new plants. The EPA has also indicated that it will propose new GHG emissions standards for refineries, but we do not know when the agency will issue any regulations.

 In December 2010, the EPA enacted final rules on mandatory reporting of GHGs. In 2011, the EPA published amendments to the rule containing technical and clarifying changes to certain GHG reporting requirements and a six-month extension for reporting GHG emissions from petroleum and natural gas industry sources. Under the amended rule, certain onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities are required to report their GHG emissions on an annual basis. We do not expect that the EPA’s mandatory GHG reporting requirements will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
 The adoption of additional legislation or regulatory programs to monitor or reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. In addition, the EPA has stated that the data collected from GHG emissions reporting programs may be the basis for future regulatory action to establish substantive GHG emissions factors. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.
  
  Water Discharges
  
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
 
 In October 2011, the EPA announced that it intends to develop national standards for wastewater discharges produced by natural gas extraction from shale and coalbed methane formations. The EPA is expected to issue proposed regulations establishing wastewater discharge standards for coalbed methane wastewater and for shale gas wastewater in 2015. For shale gas wastewater, the EPA will consider imposing pre-treatment standards for discharges to a wastewater treatment facility. Produced and other flowback water from our current operations is typically re-injected into underground formations that do not contain potable water. To the extent that re-injection is not available for our operations and discharge to wastewater treatment facilities is required, new standards from the EPA could increase the cost of disposing wastewater in connection with our operations.
  
  The Safe Drinking Water Act, Groundwater Protection and the Underground Injection Control Program
  
 The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and the Underground Injection Control program (the “UIC program”) promulgated under the SDWA and state programs regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. The EPA has delegated administration of the UIC program in Texas to the Railroad Commission of Texas (“RRC”). Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking saltwater to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and gas drilling, production and related operations may result in fines, penalties and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third-party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and bodily injury.

  Hydraulic Fracturing
  
 Hydraulic fracturing is the subject of significant focus among some environmentalists, regulators and the general public. Concerns over potential hazards associated with the use of hydraulic fracturing and its impact on the environment have been raised at all levels, including federal, state and local, as well as internationally. There have been claims that hydraulic fracturing may contaminate groundwater, reduce air quality or cause earthquakes. Hydraulic fracturing requires the use and disposal of water, and public concern has been growing over its possible effects on drinking water supplies, as well as the adequacy of water supply.
  
 The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which exempts hydraulic fracturing from regulation under the SDWA, prohibits the use of diesel fuel in the fracturing process without a UIC permit. In the past, legislation has been introduced in, but not passed by, Congress that would amend the SDWA to repeal this exemption. Specifically, the FRAC Act has been introduced in each Congress since 2008 to accomplish these purposes, and on May 9, 2013, the FRAC Act was again introduced. If similar legislation were enacted, it could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. Future federal legislation could also require the reporting and public disclosure of chemical additives used in the fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemical additives used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. If federal legislation regulating hydraulic fracturing is adopted in the future, it could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
  
 In 2010, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the UIC program by posting a requirement on its website that requires facilities to obtain permits to use diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing operations. Following a legal challenge by industry groups and a subsequent settlement, in February 2014, the EPA issued revised guidance on the use of diesel in hydraulic fracturing operations. Under the guidance, EPA broadly defined “diesel” to include fuels such as kerosene that have not traditionally been considered diesel. The EPA’s continued assertion of its regulatory authority under the SDWA could result in extensive requirements that could cause additional costs and delays in the hydraulic fracturing process.
  
 In addition to the above actions of the EPA, certain members of the Congress have called upon (i) the Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources; (ii) the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shale by means of hydraulic fracturing; and (iii) the Energy Information Administration to provide a better understanding of that agency’s estimates regarding natural gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates. The EPA has also studied the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing on water resources, publishing draft results in 2015. These and future investigations and studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could facilitate initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.
    
11


  
 
 There are also certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has also begun a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing.
 
 Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the RRC enacted a rule in December 2011, requiring disclosure to the RRC and the public of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state law, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit drilling in general and hydraulic fracturing in particular.
 
 If these or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, it could become more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce oil and gas from shale and tight sands formations and become easier for third parties opposing hydraulic fracturing to initiate legal proceedings. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, fracturing activities could become subject to delays, additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and higher costs. These new laws or regulations could cause us to incur substantial delays or suspensions of operations and compliance costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
  
  Compliance
  
 We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations that apply to our current operations and that our ongoing compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We did not incur any material capital expenditures for remediation or pollution control activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital or operating expenditures during 2017. However, the passage of additional or more stringent laws or regulations in the future could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to develop our undeveloped acreage.
 Threatened and Endangered Species, Migratory Birds and Natural Resources
  
 Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Clean Water Act and CERCLA. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of, or harm to, species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent oil and gas exploration activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and may seek natural resources damages and, in some cases, criminal penalties.

  OSHA and Other Laws and Regulations
  
 We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable requirements.
