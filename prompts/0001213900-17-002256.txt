Our Industry
 
Advances in technology architectures have supported the rise of cloud computing, which enables the delivery of a wide variety of cloud-based services. Today, mission-critical applications can be delivered reliably, securely and cost-effectively to our customers over the internet without the need to purchase supporting hardware, software or ongoing maintenance. The lower total cost of ownership, better functionality and flexibility of cloud applications represent a compelling alternative to traditional on-premise solutions. As a result, enterprises are increasingly adopting cloud services to rapidly deploy and integrate applications without building out their own expensive infrastructure and to minimize the growth of their own IT departments and create business agility by taking advantage of accelerated time-to-market dynamics.
 
Spending on public cloud services is expected to increase sharply this year and through 2019, according to analysts with International Data Corporation, a leading global market intelligence firm (“IDC”) and Gartner, Inc., a leading IT research and advisory company (“Gartner”). In a report dated January 25, 2016, Gartner analysts projected that the global public cloud services market will increase 16.5 percent last year compared with 2015 - to $204 billion.

According to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, or the NIST, cloud computing is on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management and effort and service provider interaction. The NIST has identified five essential characteristics of cloud computing:
 

● | on-demand service; 
--+-----------------------


● | broad network access; 
--+--------------------------


● | resource pooling; 
--+----------------------


● | rapid elasticity; and 
--+--------------------------


● | measured service 
--+---------------------

 
NFV and SDN are the popular software-based approaches that service providers are using to design, deploy and manage their networks and services. NFV is a telecom led initiative seeking to utilize standard IT virtualization technology to consolidate many telecom network equipment types onto industry standard high volume servers, switches and storage. Many industry leaders believe NFV will likely transform the entire telecom infrastructure ecosystem. In its report entitled “Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) Market: Business Case, Market Analysis and Forecasts 2015 – 2020”, published in November 2014, Mind Commerce, a business intelligence and technology insight company, estimated that the overall global market for NFV will grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 83.1% between 2015 and 2020, and that NFV revenues will reach $ 8.7 billion by the end of 2020.
 
Signals and Systems Telecom, a Dubai-based market intelligence and consulting firm for the worldwide telecommunications industry (“SNS Telecom”), projects exponential growth in service provider SDN and NFV investments. In its report titled ‘The SDN, NFV & Network Virtualization Ecosystem: 2015 - 2030 - Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies & Forecasts,’ SNS Telecom projects that this industry will log a 54% CAGR from 2015 to 2020, and will account for US$20 billion in revenue by 2020.
 
The SNS Telecom report states that enterprises are already aware of the several advantages offered by SDN and NFV. The deployment of these technologies is seen to be the highest in datacenter operations, telecommunications services, and enterprise IT. One aspect that makes SDN, NFV, and network virtualization much sought after is the ability of these technologies to help enterprises cope with the mounting demand for higher mobile traffic capacity. While doing so, these technologies bring down capital expenses and operating expenses, which can otherwise burden service providers. Most importantly, virtualization enables service providers to reduce their dependence on expensive and high-maintenance hardware platforms
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
During 2016, we began delivering DPoD, a hyper-converged private/hybrid cloud solution. Our DPoD product offering provides all of the attributes of a public cloud offering, including reduced capital expenditures for our customers and greater elasticity and scalability in a dedicated private cloud environment. DPoD can be deployed within our data centers or on customer premises. In addition to compute and storage resources, DPoD is fully-enabled with SDN and NFV to leverage software-based network appliances. DPoD is a ‘cloud in a box,’ that brings everything together, including a full multi-vendor professional services experience. The DPoD provides the client with a completely secure, private cloud solution that can be leveraged for nearly any business application. 
 
We believe our market advantages center around our IOT platform NFVGrid and services portfolio. Our software allows enterprise and carrier accounts to take advantage of deploying virtual network functions with service chaining for multi-vendor deployments, VNF monitoring, VNF and full network analytics, the ability to turn up a VNF or turn them off if necessary. SDN and NFV have just begun to be adopted in carrier and enterprise networks after years of planning and testing. InterCloud has a competitive advantage because our NFVGrid platform has the next-generation automation necessary to lead clients through this latest technology transformation.
 

● | Service Provider Relationships. We have established relationships with many leading wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, cable broadband MSOs, OEMs and others. Our current customers include Ericsson Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc., Century Link, Inc., AT&T Inc. and Hotwire Communications. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Strong Senior Management Team with Proven Ability to Execute. Our highly-experienced management team has deep industry knowledge and brings an average of over 25 years of individual experience across a broad range of disciplines. We believe our senior management team is a key driver of our success and is well-positioned to execute our strategy. 

Our Growth Strategy
 
Under the leadership of our senior management team, we intend to build our sales, marketing and operations groups to support our rapid growth while focusing on increasing operating margins. While organic growth will be a main focus in driving our business forward, acquisitions will play a strategic role in augmenting existing product and service lines and cross-selling opportunities. We are pursuing several strategies, including:

● | Expand Our Cloud-Based Service Offerings. We are building a company that can manage the existing network infrastructures of the largest domestic and international corporations and service providers while also delivering a broad range of enterprise and carrier-grade cloud orchestration platforms and solutions. We believe the ability to provide such services is a critical differentiator as we already have relationships with many potential customers by offering services through our three operating divisions -- applications and infrastructure, professional services, and managed services. Each of our three operating divisions intends to continue to expand by offering additional cloud services, such as cloud management of Wi-Fi and DAS networks, on a virtualized wireless controller running on our cloud rather than installed throughout a corporate network, allowing better controls and cost savings for clients. We recently expanded the service offerings of our professional services group to include services to support the roll-out of NFV, SDN and private cloud solutions and to market such services to both the service provider and enterprise markets. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Grow Revenues and Market Share through Selective Acquisitions. We plan to continue to acquire private companies that enhance our earnings and offer complementary services or expand our geographic reach. We believe such acquisitions will help us to accelerate our revenue growth, leverage our existing strengths, and capture and retain more work in-house as a prime contractor for our clients, thereby contributing to our profitability. We also believe that increased scale will enable us to bid and take on larger contracts. We believe there are many potential acquisition candidates in the high-growth cloud computing space, the fragmented professional services markets, and in the applications and infrastructure arena. 


● | Aggressively Expand Our Organic Growth Initiatives. Our customers include many leading wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, cable broadband MSOs, OEMs and enterprise customers. As we have expanded the breadth of our service offerings through both organic growth and selective acquisitions, we believe we have opportunities to expand revenues with our existing clients by marketing DPoD private cloud, NFV and SDN service offerings to them, as well as by extending services to existing customers in new geographies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expand Our Relationships with New Service Providers. We plan to expand new relationships with cable broadband providers, competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), integrated communication providers (ICs), competitive access providers (CAPs), network access point providers (NAPs) and integrated communications providers (ICPs). We believe that the business model for the expansion of these relationships, leveraging our core strength and array of service solutions, will support our business model for organic growth. 


● | Increase Operating Margins by Leveraging Operating Efficiencies. We believe that by centralizing administrative functions, consolidating insurance coverage and eliminating redundancies across our newly-acquired businesses, we will be positioned to offer more integrated end-to-end solutions and improve operating margins.

Customers
 
Our customers include many Fortune 1000 enterprises, wireless and wireline service providers, cable broadband MSOs and telecommunications OEMs. Our current service provider and OEM customers include leading telecommunications companies, such as Ericsson, Inc., Verizon Communications, Sprint Nextel Corporation and AT&T.
 
Our top four customers, Crown Castle, Uline, Ericsson, Inc., and Verizon, accounted for approximately 26% of our total revenues from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2016. Our top four customers, Ericsson, Inc., Crown Castle, ULine and NX Utilities, accounted for approximately 33% of our total revenues from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2015. No customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Ericsson, Inc. and its affiliates, as an OEM provider for seven different carrier projects, was the only customer to account for 10% or more of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, accounting for approximately 14% of our total revenues.
 
A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from work performed under multi-year master service agreements and multi-year service contracts. We have entered into master service agreements, or MSAs, with numerous service providers and OEMs, and generally have multiple agreements with each of our customers. MSAs are awarded primarily through a competitive bidding process based on the depth of our service offerings, experience and capacity. MSAs generally contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discrete pricing for individual tasks, but do not require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services. To the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, perform work with the customer’s own employees and use other service providers. Most of our MSAs may be cancelled by our customers upon minimum notice (typically 60 days), regardless of whether we are then in default. In addition, many of these contracts permit cancellation of particular purchase orders or statements of work without any prior notice. Our managed service offerings are typically sold under multi-year agreements and provide the customers with service level commitments. This is one of the fastest growing portions of our business.

Suppliers and Vendors
 
We have supply agreements with major technology vendors, such as Ericsson, Avaya, Aruba, Juniper, F5, Microsoft, Ciena, Citrix and Cisco Systems. However, for a majority of the professional services we perform, our customers supply the necessary materials. We expect to continue to further develop our relationships with our technology vendors and to broaden our scope of work with each of our partners. In many cases, our relationships with our partners have extended for over a decade, which we attribute to our commitment to excellence. It is our objective to selectively expand our partnerships moving forward in order to expand our service offerings. 
Competition
 
We provide cloud and managed services, professional services, and infrastructure and applications to the enterprise and service provider markets globally. Our markets are highly fragmented and the business is characterized by a large number of participants, including several large companies, as well as a significant number of small, privately-held, local competitors.
 
Our current and potential larger competitors include Amazon.com, Inc., Arrow Electronics, Inc., Black Box Corporation, CenturyLink Technology Solutions (formerly Savvis), Dimension Data, Dycom Industries, Inc., Goodman Networks, Inc., Hewlett Packard Company, Rackspace Hosting, Inc., SoftLayer Technologies, Inc., Tech Mahindra Limited, TeleTech Holdings, Inc. and Volt Information Sciences, Inc. A significant portion of our services revenue is currently derived from MSAs and price is often an important factor in awarding such agreements. Accordingly, our competitors may underbid us if they elect to price their services aggressively to procure such business. Our competitors may also develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. The principal competitive factors for our professional services include geographic presence, breadth of service offerings, technical skills, licensing price, quality of service and industry reputation. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors.
 
Safety and Risk Management
 
We require our employees to participate in internal training and service programs from time to time relevant to their employment and to complete any training programs required by law. We review accidents and claims from our operations, examine trends and implement changes in procedures to address safety issues. Claims arising in our business generally include workers’ compensation claims, various general liability and damage claims, and claims related to vehicle accidents, including personal injury and property damage. We insure against the risk of loss arising from our operations up to certain deductible limits in substantially all of the states in which we operate. In addition, we retain risk of loss, up to certain limits, under our employee group health plan. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to help ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage.
 
We carefully monitor claims and actively participate with our insurers in determining claims estimates and adjustments. The estimated costs of claims are accrued as liabilities, and include estimates for claims incurred but not reported. Due to fluctuations in our loss experience from year to year, insurance accruals have varied and can affect the consistency of our operating margins. If we experience insurance claims in excess of our umbrella coverage limit, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 409 full-time employees and 13 part-time employees, of whom 53 were in administration and corporate management, 8 were accounting personnel, 36 were sales personnel and 325 were technical and project managerial personnel. 
 
In general, the number of our employees varies according to the level of our work in progress. We maintain a core of technical and managerial personnel to supervise all projects and add employees as needed to complete specific projects. Because we also provide project staffing, we are well-positioned to respond to changes in our staffing needs.
