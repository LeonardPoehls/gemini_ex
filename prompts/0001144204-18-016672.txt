 Eagle Savings Bank 
 Eagle Savings Bank is an Ohio chartered stock savings and loan association that was originally organized in 1882 under the name The Price Hill Eagle Loan and Building Company No. 1 in the community of East Price Hill for the purposes of promoting savings and home ownership. The Bank changed its name to Eagle Savings Bank in 1996. We conduct our business from our main office and two branch offices. All of our offices are located in Hamilton County, Ohio. Our primary deposit-taking market includes the local communities surrounding our bank offices. Our primary lending market is Hamilton County, Ohio, and the adjoining counties of Butler, Warren and Clermont Counties in Ohio, Boone, Kenton and Campbell Counties in Kentucky, and Dearborn County in Indiana. 
 Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate and land loans, construction loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. To a lesser extent, we also make commercial business loans, multi-family real estate loans and other consumer loans. We also emphasize our mortgage banking operations. 
 We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market demand accounts and certificate of deposit accounts. We utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (the “FHLB-Cincinnati”) for asset/liability management purposes and, from time to time, for additional funding for our operations. 
 Eagle Savings Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by its primary federal regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), and by its state regulator, the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions (the “ODFI”). 
 Our executive office is located at 6415 Bridgetown Road, Cincinnati, Ohio 45248, and our telephone number at this address is (513) 574-0700. Our website address is www.eaglesavings.com. Information on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report and should not be considered part of this Annual Report. 
 Market Area

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Our primary market area is a part of the Cincinnati metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) and is both urban and suburban in nature. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Cincinnati MSA had a total population of approximately 2.1 million in 2010. Our primary market area economy is comprised of a number of employment sectors including business and professional services, healthcare, wholesale/retail, government, and finance/insurance/real estate. Based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, for December 2017, unemployment rates were 3.8%, 5.0% and 4.4% in Hamilton County, the State of Ohio and the United States as a whole, respectively. 
 According to SNL Financial LC, the number of households in Hamilton County, the Cincinnati MSA, Ohio and the United States increased by 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.3% and 0.8%, respectively, from 2010 to 2017. Between 2017 and 2022, the number of households in Hamilton County, the Cincinnati MSA, Ohio and the United States are projected to increase by 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.3% and 0.8%, respectively. 
 Competition 
 We face competition within our market area both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a concentration of financial institutions that include large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. We also face competition from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies and credit unions and, with respect to deposits, from money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. As of June 30, 2017, based on the most recent available FDIC data, our market share of deposits represented 0.12% of FDIC-insured deposits in Hamilton County, ranking us 17th in market share of deposits. 
 Strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of new legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued industry consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures than we do. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services than we can as well as better pricing for those products and services. 
 Lending Activities 
 General.   Our principal lending activity is originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans, and home equity loans and lines of credit. To a lesser extent, we also originate commercial business loans, multi-family real estate loans and other consumer loans. We plan to grow and diversify our loan portfolio by increasing our commercial business lending, our commercial real estate lending, and our home equity loans and lines of credit. 
 Commercial real estate loans generally carry greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family real estate, and these risks will increase if we succeed in our plan to increase this type of lending. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family real estate. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential real estate loan. 
 Increasing our portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit will increase our credit risk. Most of our home equity loans and lines of credit are secured by real estate in Hamilton County, Ohio and contiguous counties. We generally originate home equity loans and lines of credit with loan-to-value ratios of up to 90% when combined with the principal balance of the existing first mortgage loan. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our home equity loans to be adequately collateralized, which would expose us to greater risk of loss in the event that we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Beginning in 2001, we began to increase the number of loans that we originate for sale to the secondary market. We currently originate most of our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans for sale to the FHLB-Cincinnati through the MPP. During 2017 we originated $82.8 million one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and sold $66.8 million of such loans primarily to the FHLB-Cincinnati through the MPP. See “— Loan Originations, Participations, Purchases and Sales” below for more information regarding our sale of loans through the MPP. We currently employ five residential mortgage loan originators, and we intend to hire up to six new commission-based mortgage lenders over the next three years, as well as additional support staff as needed. Our mortgage banking infrastructure and risk management systems will allow us to safely manage a significantly larger volume of loans. 
 Our mortgage banking business is subject to risks that could negatively affect our non-interest income. In a rising or higher interest rate environment, our originations of mortgage loans may decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors. This would result in a decrease in mortgage banking revenues. Under the terms of the MPP, we are required to maintain a Lender Risk Account (“LRA”). The LRA consists of amounts withheld from the loan sale proceeds by the FHLB-Cincinnati for absorbing potential losses on the loans we sell. These withheld funds are an asset to the Company as they are scheduled to be paid to the Company in future years, net of any credit losses on the loans sold. If there are higher than expected losses on the loans we have sold to the FHLB-Cincinnati through the MPP, the amount of the LRA would be reduced through a charge to earnings, which would reduce our earnings. 
 In addition, our loans sold in the secondary market have agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that we have sold in cases of borrower default or breaches of these representations and warranties. If we are required to repurchase mortgage loans or provide indemnification or other recourse, this could significantly increase our costs and thereby affect our future earnings.

 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority.   Pursuant to applicable law, the aggregate amount of loans that we are permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15% of Eagle Savings Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. We may lend an additional amount to one person up to 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, to the extent that such amount is secured by readily marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion, but generally does not include real estate. In addition, we have established an in-house limit that is less than the legal limits on loans to one borrower. At December 31, 2017, our largest credit relationship commitment totaled $3.3 million and was secured by business equipment and had an outstanding balance of $2.1 million. Our second largest relationship at December 31, 2017 totaled $2.7 million and was secured by commercial real estate. At December 31, 2017, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their terms. 
 Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations. The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items on the application are verified through use of credit reports, financial statements and tax returns.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Generally, we require title insurance on our mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property, depending on the type of loan. We also require flood insurance if the property is determined to be in a flood zone area. 
 Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Residential Lending Manager each have approval authority for up to $453,100 for residential mortgage loans. They may combine their authority such that together they can approve residential loans of up to $906,200. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President of Commercial Lending each have approval authority for up to $453,100 for all secured commercial loans. They may combine their authority such that together they can approve commercial loans of up to $906,200. For unsecured credit, the President and Chief Executive Officer has an authority of $50,000 and the Vice President of Commercial Lending has an authority of $150,000. They may combine their authority such that together they may approve unsecured loans up to $200,000. Any loans in excess of these prescribed limits require the approval of the board of directors. All loans to one borrower will be aggregated for determining the limits as described above. 
 One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending.   The focus of our lending program has historically been the origination of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2017, we had $60.8 million of loans secured by one- to four-family real estate, representing 57.8% of our total loan portfolio. We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2017, the one- to four-family residential mortgage loans held in our portfolio were comprised of 78.9% fixed-rate loans, and 21.1% adjustable-rate loans. 
 Our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency for Fannie Mae, which is currently $453,100 for single-family homes in our market area. We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which are referred to as “jumbo loans.” We also offer FHA loans, which we originate for sale on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis in accordance with FHA guidelines. Although we are an approved Title II Direct Endorsement Mortgagee with the FHA, we currently use a third-party underwriter with expertise in this type of lending. Currently, our lead mortgage loan processor is in the process of training to become a Direct Endorsement Underwriter. Virtually all of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are secured by properties located in our market area. 
 We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans to 80% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is lower. In addition, we may make one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios between 80% and 95% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less, where the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance. FHA loans may be made with loan-to-value ratios up to 96.5% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less. 
 Our one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of 15 or 30 years. Our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans generally have fixed rates for initial terms of five, seven or ten years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin. In recent years, this margin has been 2.75% over the weekly average yield on U.S. treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2% per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally 4% or 6% over the initial interest rate of the loan. Adjustable-rate one-to four-family residential real estate loans are originated on a servicing retained basis. 
 In the past we originated loans on non-owner occupied one- to four-family properties. At December 31, 2017, we had $7.1 million of loans secured by non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential real estate, representing 6.7% of our total loan portfolio and 11.7% of our total one- to four-family real estate portfolio. We do not intend to make such loans in the future. 
 Since 2001, we have originated an increasing amount of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans for sale to the secondary market. During 2017, we sold approximately 80.7% of the one- to four-family residential real estate loans we originated to the secondary market. These sales were primarily

  through the FHLB-Cincinnati’s MPP. See “— Loan Originations, Participations, Purchases and Sales” below for additional information regarding our sale of loans through the MPP. We intend to grow our mortgage banking operations in the future. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Business Strategy” for a further discussion of our strategy to increase mortgage banking. 
 The one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we retain for our portfolio include shorter-term fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans, jumbo loans and other non-conforming loans that have mitigating strengths that make the loan an appropriate risk. 
 We do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on permanent one- to four-family residential real estate loans (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not currently offer “subprime loans” on one- to four-family residential real estate loans (i.e., generally loans with credit scores less than 660). In addition, we do not intend to offer interest only, Option ARM or subprime loans in the future. 
 We also originate home equity lines of credit and fixed-term home equity loans. See “— Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit, and Other Consumer Lending”, below. 
 Commercial Real Estate, Land and Multi-Family Residential Lending.   In recent years, we have sought to increase our commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate loans are secured primarily by office buildings, retail and mixed-use properties, and light industrial properties located in our primary market area. To a lesser extent, we also make multi-family loans secured primarily by residential apartment buildings and land loans primarily secured by land located in our primary market area. At December 31, 2017, we had $13.7 million in commercial real estate and land loans and $2.1 million in multi-family real estate loans, representing 13.1% and 2.0% of our total loan portfolio, respectively. 
 Most of our commercial and multi-family real estate loans have a maximum term of up to 30 years. The interest rates on commercial real estate and multi-family loans are generally fixed for an initial period of one to five years and adjust annually thereafter based on the One Year Treasury Rate. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans is generally 80% or less. For properties on which there will be a third party junior lien, the maximum loan-to-value ratio is 70%. All loan-to-value ratios are subject to our underwriting procedures and guidelines. At December 31, 2017, our largest commercial real estate loan totaled $2.1 million and was secured by business equipment. At that date, our largest multi-family real estate loan totaled $480,000 and was secured by an apartment complex. At December 31, 2017, both of these loans were performing in accordance with their terms. 
 Set forth below is information regarding our commercial real estate total loans at December 31, 2017.

 We consider a number of factors in originating commercial and multi-family real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). All commercial real estate and multi-family loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by the board of directors. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial and multi-family real estate borrowers. 
 Raw land loans have a 5 year maturity with a 25 year amortization. The maximum loan-to-value of these loans is 60% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property. 
 At December 31, 2017, we had $1.7 million of total land loans outstanding. Included in this was one loan for the acquisition and development of a one- to four-family residential development project. This loan had a $1.1 million commitment, of which $344,000 had been disbursed at December 31, 2017. This was our largest land loan, and was performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2017. 
 Loans secured by commercial real estate, raw land and multi-family real estate generally involve greater credit risk. Commercial real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. This greater risk is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Repayment of commercial real estate loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such properties, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family residential real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. If the cash flow from the project is reduced (for example, if leases are not obtained or renewed), the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Accordingly, the nature of these loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate. 
 Commercial Business Lending.   At December 31, 2017, we had $5.5 million of commercial business loans, representing 5.3% of our total loan portfolio. With the proceeds from the offering, we intend to increase of emphasis on commercial business lending. We offer regular lines of credit and revolving lines of credit with terms of up to 12 months to small businesses in our market area to finance short-term working capital needs such as accounts receivable and inventory. Our commercial lines of credit are typically adjustable-rate generally based on the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. We generally obtain personal guarantees with respect to all commercial business lines of credit. We also offer term loans of five to seven years. 
 We typically originate commercial business loans on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business, the experience and stability of the borrower’s management team, earnings projections and the underlying assumptions, and the value and marketability of any collateral securing the loan. Commercial business loans are generally secured by a variety of collateral, primarily accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment in our market area. Therefore, commercial business loans that we originate have greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans or, generally, consumer loans. In addition, commercial business loans often result in larger outstanding balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers, and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts. 
 Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit, and Other Consumer Lending.   At December 31, 2017, we had $12.6 million, or 12.0% of our loan portfolio, in home equity loans and lines of credit. We intend to increase our portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit in proportion to the increase in our total loan portfolio in 2018. 
 Our home equity lines of credit and fixed-term equity loans are secured by owner occupied residential property. Home equity lines of credit are variable rate, and are approved with a maximum maturity of up to 10 years. Fixed-term home equity loans are generally originated in accordance with the same standards as 

 8

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. We extend home equity lines of credit and fixed-term equity loans on owner occupied property regardless of whether we hold the first mortgage. We do not extend home equity lines of credit unless the combined loan-to-value ratio of the first mortgage and the home equity line of credit or fixed-term equity loan is 90% or less. 
 Home equity lines of credit and fixed-term equity loans have greater risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by first mortgages. Our interest is generally subordinated to the interest of the institution holding the first mortgage. Even where we hold the first mortgage, we face the risk that the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and costs of foreclosure. As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. 
 Home equity loans and lines of credit and other consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering these loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. 
 From time to time we may make consumer loans other than home equity loans and lines of credit, generally as an accommodation to existing customers. At December 31, 2017, we had $14,000 in other consumer loans. 
 Construction Lending.   We originate construction loans, primarily for one- to four-family residential properties. At December 31, 2017, $10.4 million, or 9.9%, of our total loan portfolio, consisted of construction loans, all of which were secured by one- to four-family residential real estate. At December 31, 2017, the unadvanced portion of one- to four-family residential construction loans totaled $6.2 million. Using the proceeds from the offering, we intend to expand our construction lending for one- to four-family residential properties. From time to time we may also consider making construction loans for commercial real estate properties, including multi-family properties, if attractive opportunities arise. 
 Construction loans for one- to four-family residential properties are originated with a maximum loan to value ratio of 80% and are generally “interest-only” loans during the construction period which typically does not exceed 12 months. After this time period, the loan converts to permanent, amortizing financing following the completion of construction. We generally require that a commitment for permanent financing be in place prior to closing the construction loan. 
 Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Construction loans also expose us to the risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs or that we may take possession of a partially completed project. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated. 
 At December 31, 2017, our largest construction loan had a principal balance of $792,000. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2017. 
 Loan Originations, Participations, Purchases and Sales. 
 Most of our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel and from referrals from existing customers and real estate brokers. All loans we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. While we originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and pricing levels established by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our loan originations can vary from period to period.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Since 2001, and consistent with our interest rate risk strategy in the low interest rate environment, we have sold on a servicing-released basis most of the fixed-rate conforming one- to four-family residential mortgage loans that we have originated. We currently sell most of these loans to the FHLB-Cincinnati through the MPP. During 2017 we originated $82.8 million fixed-rate and adjustable rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and sold $66.8 million of such loans primarily to the FHLB-Cincinnati through the MPP. As part of our business strategy, we intend to expand our mortgage banking activity by adding up to six new commission-based mortgage lenders over the next three years. We believe that our mortgage banking infrastructure and risk management systems will allow us to safely manage a significantly larger volume of loans. 
 Under the terms of the MPP, we are required to maintain a Lender Risk Account (“LRA”). The LRA consists of amounts withheld from the loan sale proceeds by the FHLB-Cincinnati for absorbing inherent losses that are probable on the loans we sell. These withheld funds are an asset to the Company as they are scheduled to be paid to the Company in future years, net of any credit losses on the loans sold. The funds withheld to settle these potential losses totaled $5.8 million at December 31, 2017; however, these receivables are recorded at fair value, which includes consideration of inherent losses that are probable and net present value discounts. The carrying value of the LRA totaled $3.2 million at December 31, 2017. 
 We have developed certain processes and procedures to monitor and mitigate the risks associated with our mortgage banking activities, including: 
 •

 independent daily pricing to establish profitability targets; 
 ​
 •

 a central rate lock desk to mitigate risk of pair off fees; 
 ​
 •

 selling loans pursuant to mandatory delivery contracts to eliminate warehouse and pipeline risk; 
 ​
 •

 underwriting review of each file to avoid loan repurchases for non-compliance with underwriting requirements; and 
 ​
 •

 quality control performed by an independent third party vendor. 
 ​
 From time to time, we may purchase loan participations secured by properties within and outside of our primary lending market area in which we are not the lead lender. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At December 31, 2017, we had six participation loans totaling $3.5 million in which we were not the lead lender. We also have sold portions of loans from time to time that exceeded our loans-to-one borrower legal lending limit and for risk diversification. At December 31, 2017 we had two participation loans totaling $1.9 million in which we were the lead lender, $1.2 million of which were sold.

Delinquencies, Classified Assets and Non-Performing Assets 
 Delinquency Procedures.   When a borrower fails to make a required monthly payment by the due date, a late notice is generated stating the payment and late charges due. Our policies provide that a late notice be sent when a loan is 15 days past due. In addition, we may call the borrower when the loan is 30 days past due, and we attempt to cooperate with the borrower to determine the reason for nonpayment and to work 

 11

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  with the borrower to establish a repayment schedule that will cure the delinquency. Once the loan is considered in default, generally at 90 days past due, a certified letter is generally sent to the borrower explaining that the entire balance of the loan is due and payable, the loan is placed on non-accrual status, and additional efforts are made to contact the borrower. If the borrower does not respond, we generally consider initiating foreclosure proceedings when the loan is 90 to 120 days past due. If the loan is reinstated, foreclosure proceedings will be discontinued and the borrower will be permitted to continue to make payments. In certain instances, we may modify the loan or grant a limited exemption from loan payments to allow the borrower to reorganize his or her financial affairs. 
 When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed real estate until it is sold. The real estate is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition less estimated costs to sell, and any write-down resulting from the acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent decreases in the value of the property are charged to operations through the creation of a valuation allowance. After acquisition, all costs in maintaining the property are expensed as incurred. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. 
 Troubled Debt Restructurings.   We occasionally modify loans to help a borrower stay current on his or her loan and to avoid foreclosure. We consider modifications only after analyzing the borrower’s current repayment capacity, evaluating the strength of any guarantors based on documented current financial information, and assessing the current value of any collateral pledged. We generally do not forgive principal or interest on loans, but may do so if it is in our best interest and increases the likelihood that we can collect the remaining principal balance. We may modify the terms of loans to lower interest rates (which may be at below market rates), to provide for fixed interest rates on loans where fixed rates are otherwise not available, or to provide for interest-only terms. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and that is in our best interests. At December 31, 2017, we had six loans totaling $573,000 that were classified as troubled debt restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings may also be included in non-accrual loans if they are not performing in accordance with their modified terms or had been performing in accordance with their modified terms for less than six months since the date of restructuring. 
 At December 31, 2017 and during the twelve months then ended, there were no non-accruing troubled debt restructurings. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $30,000 of interest income on such loans, the same amount that would have been recorded on the loans under their original terms.

 Classified Assets.   Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the FDIC to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific allowance for loan losses is not warranted. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by management. 
 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover losses that were both probable and reasonable to estimate. General allowances represent allowances which have been established to cover accrued losses associated with lending activities that were both probable and reasonable to estimate, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific allowances. 
 In connection with the filing of our periodic regulatory reports and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the “watch list” initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing as agreed, or delinquency status, or if the loan possesses weaknesses although currently performing. Management reviews the status of each loan on our watch list on a quarterly basis with the board of directors. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to “special mention,” “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status and classified “substandard.”

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  For the year ended December 31, 2017, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $18,000. Interest income recognized on such loans for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $3,000. 
 Other Loans of Concern.   There were no other loans at December 31, 2017 that are not already disclosed where there is information about possible credit problems of borrowers that caused management to have serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and that may result in disclosure of such loans in the future. 
Allowance for Loan Losses 
 Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses.   Our allowance for loan losses is the amount considered necessary to reflect probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings. 
 Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements: (1) allocated allowances for identified impaired loans; and (2) a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio. 
 We identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans, classified loans, and other loans about which management may have concerns about collectability. For individually reviewed loans, the borrower’s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan, as well as a shortfall in collateral value, could result in our charging off the loan or the portion of the loan that was impaired. 
 Among other factors, we consider current general economic conditions, including current housing price depreciation, in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses for our residential real estate portfolio. We use evidence obtained from our own loan portfolio as well as published housing data on our local markets from third party sources we believe to be reliable as a basis for assumptions about the impact of housing depreciation. 
 Substantially all of our loans are secured by collateral. Loans 90 days past due and other classified loans are evaluated for impairment and general or specific allowances are established. Typically for a non-performing real estate loan in the process of collection, the value of the underlying collateral is estimated using either the original independent appraisal, adjusted for current economic conditions and other factors, or a new independent appraisal or evaluation, and related general or specific allowances for loan losses are adjusted on a quarterly basis. If a non-performing real estate loan is in the process of foreclosure and/or there are serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, and there is uncertainty about the value of the underlying collateral, we will order a new independent appraisal or evaluation if it has not already been obtained. Any shortfall would result in immediately charging off the portion of the loan that was impaired. 
 Allocated Allowances for Identified Problem Loans.   We establish an allocated allowance when loans are determined to be impaired. Loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling expenses. Factors in identifying a specific problem loan include: (1) the strength of the customer’s personal or business cash flows; (2) the availability of other sources of repayment; (3) the amount due or past due; (4) the type and value of collateral; (5) the strength of our collateral position; (6) the estimated cost to sell the collateral; and (7) the borrower’s effort to cure the delinquency. In addition, for loans secured by real estate, we consider the extent of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral on the mortgage. 
 General Valuation Allowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio.   We establish a general allowance for loans that are not classified as impaired to recognize the probable incurred losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, has not been allocated to particular problem assets. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience for the last three years, delinquency trends and management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio. The allowance may be adjusted for

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  significant qualitative factors that, in management’s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary market area, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current real estate environment. 
 As an integral part of their examination process, the FDIC and the ODFI will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.

​ 

 At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our allowance for loan losses represented 1.12% and 1.27% of total loans and 86.58% and 145.21% of non-performing loans. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance are necessary if the quality of any portion of our loan portfolio deteriorates as a result. Furthermore, as an integral part of its examination process, the FDIC and ODFI will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. The FDIC and ODFI may require that we increase our allowance based on its judgments of information available to it at the time of its examination. The regulatory agencies are not, however, directly involved in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and decisions to increase and decrease the allowance are the responsibility of Eagle Savings Bank management. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will affect our allowance for loan losses, effective for Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. and Eagle Savings Bank for fiscal year 2021. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Investment Activities 
 General.   Our investment policy is established by the board of directors. The objectives of the policy are to: (i) ensure adequate liquidity for loan demand and deposit fluctuations, and to allow us to alter our liquidity position to meet both day-to-day and long-term changes in assets and liabilities; (ii) manage interest rate risk in accordance with our interest rate risk policy; (iii) provide collateral for pledging requirements; (iv) maximize return on our investments; and (v) maintain a balance of high quality diversified investments to minimize risk.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Our investment committee, consisting of our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Executive Vice President, and our Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, is responsible for implementing our investment policy, including approval of investment strategies and monitoring investment performance. The board of directors regularly reviews our investment strategies and the market value of our investment portfolio. Historically we have invested in short term funds and interest-earning deposits as well as bank owned life insurance. Investment in longer term securities has not been part of our core investment strategy. Subject to ongoing asset/liability management and possible short-term investment of the proceeds of the offering until we can deploy the proceeds into higher earning assets, we do not expect to emphasize long-term investment in securities in the future. 
 We account for investment securities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 320, “Investments — Debt and Equity Securities.” Accounting Standards Codification 320 requires that investments be categorized as held-to maturity, trading, or available for sale. 
 Federally chartered savings institutions have authority to invest in various types of assets, including government-sponsored enterprise obligations, securities of various federal agencies, residential mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, corporate debt instruments, debt instruments of municipalities and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac equity securities. At December 31, 2017, other than stock in the FHLB-Cincinnati, we held no investment securities in our portfolio; and accordingly, there is no corresponding table setting forth maturities and yields at such date. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Stock.   We hold common stock of the FHLB-Cincinnati in connection with our FHLB borrowing activities totaling $736,000 and $728,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The FHLB-Cincinnati common stock is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. We may be required to purchase additional FHLB-Cincinnati stock if we increase our FHLB-Cincinnati advances in the future. 
Sources of Funds 
 General.   Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also utilize advances from the FHLB-Cincinnati for asset/liability management purposes and, from time to time, for additional funding for our operations. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
 Deposits.   Our deposits are generated primarily from our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts, statement savings accounts, variable rate money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. We have not in the past used, and currently do not hold, any brokered deposits. At December 31, 2017, our core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates of deposit, were $59.4 million, representing 58.8% of total deposits. 
 We participate in the National CD Rateline Program as a wholesale source for certificates of deposit to supplement deposits generated through our retail banking operations. The Rateline Program provides an internet based listing service which connects financial institutions such as Eagle Savings Bank with other financial institutions for jumbo certificates of deposit. Deposits obtained through the Rateline Program are not considered to be brokered deposits. At December 31, 2017, approximately $2.2 million of our certificates of deposit, representing 2.2% of our total deposits, had been obtained through the Rateline Program. At December 31, 2017, these certificates of deposit had an average term to maturity of 16 months. Early withdrawal of these deposits is not permitted, which makes these accounts a more stable source of funds. 
 Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers’ demands. Our ability to generate deposits is affected by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products. We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates.

 Borrowings.   From time to time we obtain advances from the FHLB-Cincinnati upon the security of our capital stock in the FHLB-Cincinnati and certain of our mortgage loans. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to reprice than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the maturity of our FHLB-Cincinnati advances. At December 31, 2017, we had $9,000 in outstanding advances from the FHLB-Cincinnati. At December 31, 2017, based on available collateral, our ownership of FHLB stock, and based upon our internal policy, we had access to additional FHLB-Cincinnati advances of up to $29.8 million, and an additional $10.0 million on a line of credit with the FHLB-Cincinnati.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
 General 
 As an Ohio-chartered savings and loan association, Eagle Savings Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the ODFI and the FDIC. This regulation and supervision establish a comprehensive framework of activities in which Eagle Savings Bank may engage and are intended primarily for protection of depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, and not for the protection of stockholders. Under this system of regulation, depository institutions are periodically examined to determine whether they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates and are otherwise in safe and sound financial condition and comply with applicable law and regulations. Eagle Savings Bank is also regulated to a lesser extent by the Federal Reserve Board, which governs the reserves to be maintained against certain deposits and other matters. Eagle Savings Bank must comply with federal consumer protection regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Eagle Savings Bank is a member of and owns stock in the FHLB-Cincinnati, which is one of the eleven regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. 
 As a savings and loan holding company, Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. is subject to examination and supervision by, and reporting to, the Federal Reserve Board. Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Eagle Savings Bank and Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Eagle Savings Bank and Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. Any change in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc., and Eagle Savings Bank and their operations. 
 Ohio Regulation 
 Prior to 2018, Ohio-chartered banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations were governed by three different sets of Ohio laws. Effective January 1, 2018, the Ohio Legislature amended Ohio’s banking laws so that Ohio-chartered banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations are under one common form of charter. Sections of the code that formerly governed savings and loan associations and savings banks were eliminated. Accordingly, Eagle Savings Bank is now governed by the same statutory framework as Ohio banks and savings banks. However, under the new laws, a savings and loan associations may elect to continue to be classified as a savings and loan association if the savings and loan association continues to hold the required amount of qualified thrift investments. As a result of Eagle Savings Bank making such an election, Eagle Savings Bank is subject to the same Ohio laws as banks and savings banks, but Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. continues to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company for purposes of federal law. 
 There were numerous other amendments to the banking code, including, among other things, the following: 
 •

 providing that Ohio financial institutions should have “competitive parity” with other types of nationally-chartered financial institutions that operate in Ohio. This change generally allows Ohio financial institutions to undertake the same business activities of national banks, with some exceptions;
 ​
 •

 clarifying the extent to which the Ohio general corporation law applies to Ohio financial institutions;
 ​
 •

 strengthening individual financial institutions directors’ defenses against personal liability by specifically incorporating the common defenses provided by Ohio corporate law to directors for actions taken to further the best interest of the financial institution or in reliance in good faith on the financial institution’s management, staff or other experts; and
 ​
 •

 clarifying that the enforcement authority for Ohio banking law is limited to banking regulators and does not extend to private parties. 
 ​

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  The ODFI is responsible for the regulation and supervision of Ohio savings associations in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio. Ohio law prescribes the permissible investments and activities of Ohio savings and loan associations. Pursuant to federal law, the ability of Ohio associations to engage in state-authorized investments and activities is subject to oversight and approval by the FDIC if such investments or activities are not permissible for a federally chartered savings bank. 
 The approval of the ODFI is required for certain expansion proposals, such as the establishment of branches and acquisitions of other depository institutions. Dividend payments to stockholders may also require ODFI approval under certain circumstances. 
 The ODFI may initiate certain supervisory measures or formal enforcement actions against Ohio savings associations. Ultimately, if the grounds provided by law exist, the ODFI may place an Ohio association in conservatorship or receivership. 
 The ODFI conducts regular examinations of Eagle Savings Bank. Such examinations are often conducted jointly with the FDIC. The ODFI imposes assessments on Ohio savings associations based on their asset size to cover the cost of supervision and examination. 
 Federal Regulation 
 The FDIC is the primary federal regulator for Eagle Savings Bank. As such, it has authority to examine Eagle Savings Bank and must approve such matters as the establishment of branch offices and mergers in which Eagle Savings Bank is the resulting institution. In addition, federal statutes and regulations, some of which are discussed below, greatly affect the operations of FDIC-insured depository institutions, including savings associations. 
 Capital Requirements.   Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The current capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on certain “available for sale” securities holdings are also included in common equity Tier 1 capital unless the institution has exercised a one-time opt out election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income. Eagle Savings Bank elected to exercise its one-time option to opt out. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, including cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the institution’s allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in. It is currently at 1.875%, and will be fully phased in at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  The FDIC also has authority to establish enhanced individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of particular circumstances. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness.   As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and cover problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 
 Investment Activities.   Subject to certain exceptions, Federal law generally limits the equity investment authority of state savings associations to equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for federal savings associations, notwithstanding state law. In addition, a state savings association may only engage as principal in other state-authorized activities that are permissible for federal savings associations if it meets all applicable capital requirements and by the FDIC determines that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. 
 Interstate Banking and Branching.   Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, banks are permitted to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis to the extent that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state. 
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action.   Federal law requires, among other things, that the FDIC and other federal bank regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. The regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 
 At each successive lower undercapitalized capital category, an insured depository institution may be subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, an insured depository institution that is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized institution’s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to 

 24

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” institutions must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to, an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
 Loans-to-One-Borrower.   Pursuant to federal law, a state savings association may not make a loan or extension of credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which is generally defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion (but does not include real estate). 
 Qualified Thrift Lender Test.   Federal law requires savings associations to satisfy a qualified thrift lender (“QTL”) test under which an association must either qualify as a “domestic building and loan” as defined by the Internal Revenue Code or maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments for at least nine out of every twelve months. “Qualified thrift investments” consist primarily of residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed and related securities. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets less specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and the value of property used to conduct business. A savings association that fails the QTL test must operate under specified restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test also subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. As of December 31, 2017, Eagle Savings Bank maintained 75.9% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and, therefore, met the QTL test. 
 Transactions with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations.   Transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by federal law. An affiliate is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the institution. In a holding company context, the parent holding company and any companies that are controlled by the parent holding company are affiliates of the savings association (although subsidiaries of the savings associations itself are generally not considered affiliates). Generally, federal law limits the extent to which a savings association or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus and such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from and issuance of a guarantee on behalf of an affiliate and other specified transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by an institution to an affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in federal law. “Covered transactions,” as well as to certain specified other transactions, are required to be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution as those provided to a non-affiliate. 
 Capital Distributions.   FDIC regulations govern capital distributions by a state savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the institution’s capital account. A state savings association must file an application with the FDIC for approval of a capital distribution if: 
 •

 the total capital distributions for that calendar year (including the proposed distribution) exceed the sum of the savings association’s net income for that year to date plus the savings association’s retained net income for the preceding two years; 
 ​
 •

 the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized (as defined for prompt corrective action purposes) following the distribution; 
 ​
 •

 the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory-imposed condition; or 
 ​
 •

 the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings. 
 ​

​
  25

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a holding company, such as Eagle Savings Bank, must file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution. 
 The FDIC or the Federal Reserve Board may disapprove an application or notice if: 
 •

 the savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution; 
 ​
 •

 the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or 
 ​
 •

 the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation, agreement with a federal banking regulatory agency or condition imposed in connection with an application or notice. 
 ​
 Federal law also restricts a savings association’s loans to its insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and stockholders (i.e., control of 10% or more of a class of voting stock). Loans to insiders of an institution and certain related interests of such persons, may not exceed specified limits. Loans to insiders are also generally required to be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, subject to an exception for loan programs open to the institution’s employees, and prior board approval is required for certain such loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by an institution to its insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Federal law places additional restrictions on an institution’s loans to its executive officers. 
 Enforcement.   The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings associations, including Eagle Savings Bank. The enforcement authority includes, among others, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. 
 Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts.   Eagle Savings Bank is a member of the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund. Deposit accounts in Eagle Savings Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation imposes deposit insurance assessments. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were initially assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depended upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, with less risky institutions paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) ranged from 21∕2 to 45 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s volume of deposits. Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories. Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for institutions of less than $10 billion in total assets to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points, also effective July 1, 2016. The Dodd-Frank Act specifies that banks of greater than $10 billion in assets be required to bear the burden of raising the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. Such institutions are subject to an annual surcharge of 4.5 basis points of total assets exceeding $10 billion. This surcharge will remain in place until the earlier of the Deposit Insurance Fund reaching the 1.35% ratio or December 31, 2018, at which point a shortfall assessment would be applied. The FDIC, exercising discretion provided to it by the Dodd-Frank Act, has established a long-term goal of achieving a 2% reverse ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Future insurance assessment rates cannot be predicted. 

 26

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.34 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. 
 Privacy Regulations.   Federal regulations generally require that Eagle Savings Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, Eagle Savings Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. Eagle Savings Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations. 
 Community Reinvestment Act.   Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by federal regulations, a depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for depository institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a state savings association, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution, including applications to establish branches and acquire other institutions by merger. The CRA requires a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Eagle Savings Bank’s latest CRA rating was “Satisfactory.” 
 USA Patriot Act.   Eagle Savings Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act contains provisions intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 
Other Laws and Regulations 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Eagle Savings Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Lending operations are also subject to state and federal laws and regulations applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 
 •

 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 
 ​
 •

 Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination in extending credit on the basis of race, religion, sex, creed or other specified factors; 
 ​
 •

 Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and 
 ​
 •

 Truth in Lending Act, establishing customer disclosure requirements with respect to certain loans.
 ​

​
  27

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  The deposit operations of Eagle Savings Bank are subject to, among others, the: 
 •

 Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 
 ​
 •

 Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; 
 ​
 •

 Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and 
 ​
 •

 Truth in Savings Act, establishing customer disclosure requirements for certain deposit accounts. 
 ​
 The Dodd-Frank Act transferred regulation-writing authority for federal financial consumer protection laws to the CFPB. However, institutions with under $10.0 billion of total assets, such as Eagle Savings Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with such laws and regulations by their federal bank regulator, which is the FDIC in Eagle Savings Bank’s case.

 The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating $122.3 million or less (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3.0%, and for amounts greater than $122.3 million the reserve requirement is 10.0% (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board to between 8.0% and 14.0%). The first $16.0 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. Eagle Savings Bank is in compliance with these requirements. 
Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 Eagle Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. Eagle Savings Bank was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2017. 
Holding Company Regulation 
 Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. and any non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to Eagle Savings Bank. 
 As a savings and loan holding company, the activities of Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. is limited to those activities permitted for financial holding companies (if Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. meets the necessary requirements to be a financial holding company and makes the required election) or multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, incidental to a financial activity or complementary to financial activities. Such activities include lending and other activities permitted for bank holding companies, insurance and underwriting equity securities. Multiple savings and loan holding companies are authorized to engage in activities specified by federal regulation, including activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, with appropriate Federal Reserve Board approvals.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company from, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository institution not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider such factors as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. A savings and loan holding company may not acquire a savings institution in another state and hold the target institution as a separate subsidiary unless it is a supervisory acquisition under Section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state companies. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act codified the “source of strength” doctrine. That longstanding policy of the Federal Reserve Board requires bank holding companies to serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The policy statement also provides for regulatory consultation prior to a holding company paying dividends or redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments under certain circumstances. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act makes depository institutions liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the insurance fund in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. That law would have potential applicability if Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. ever held as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to Eagle Savings Bank. 
 Federal Securities Laws 
 Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc.’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 The registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of shares of common stock issued in the stock offering does not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not our affiliates may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by our affiliates are subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If we meet the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate of ours that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate’s sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1% of our outstanding shares, or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. In the future, we may permit affiliates to have their shares registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” We qualify as an “emerging growth company” and believe that we will continue to qualify as an “emerging growth company” for five years from the completion of our initial public offering on July 20, 2017. 
 Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company” we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Act, (iii) hold non-binding stockholder votes regarding annual executive compensation or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger or similar corporate transaction, (iv) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (v) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier. However, we will not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure, regardless of the exemptions, so long as we remain a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally less than $75 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). 
 We could remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (b) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations. 
 Change in Control Regulations 
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company, such as Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a savings and loan holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 The approval of the ODFI is also necessary for acquisitions of control of Ohio savings associations. 
 In addition, federal law provides that no company may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “savings and loan holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.

  TAXATION 
 Federal Taxation 
 General.   Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. and Eagle Savings Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. and Eagle Savings Bank. 
 Method of Accounting.   For federal income tax purposes, Eagle Savings Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31th for filing its federal income tax returns. Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. and Eagle Savings Bank will file a consolidated federal income tax return. Eagle Savings Bank is not currently under audit with respect to its federal income tax return. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the percentage of taxable income method of accounting for income taxes on bad debt reserves by savings institutions, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995. 
 Minimum Tax.   The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, less an exemption amount, referred to as “alternative minimum taxable income.” The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent tax computed this way exceeds tax computed by applying the regular tax rates to regular taxable income. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2016, Eagle Savings Bank is not subject to the alternative minimum tax and will not be subject to the alternative minimum tax until it exceeds the gross income threshold. At December 31, 2017, Eagle Savings Bank had no minimum tax credit carryforward. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers.   Generally, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2017, Eagle Savings Bank had no federal net operating loss carryforwards. 
 Capital Loss Carryovers.   A corporation cannot recognize capital losses in excess of capital gains generated. Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any undeducted loss remaining after the five year carryover period is not deductible. At December 31, 2017, Eagle Savings Bank had no capital loss carryovers. 
 Corporate Dividends.   We may generally exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from Eagle Savings Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 
 State Taxation 
 Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. and Eagle Savings Bank are subject to Ohio taxation in the same general manner as other financial institutions. In particular, Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. and Eagle Savings Bank will file a consolidated Ohio Financial Institutions Tax (FIT) return. The FIT is based upon the net worth of the consolidated group. For Ohio FIT purposes, savings institutions are currently taxed at a rate equal to 0.8% of taxable net worth. Eagle Savings Bank is not currently under audit with respect to its Ohio FIT returns. 
 As a Maryland business corporation, Eagle Financial Bancorp, Inc. will be required to file an annual personal property tax return with the State of Maryland. Eagle Savings Bank’s state income tax returns have not been audited in recent years.
