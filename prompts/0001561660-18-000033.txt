Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are an independent power company focused on owning and operating power projects with stable long-term cash flows in attractive markets with potential for continued growth of our business.
We hold interests in 25 wind and solar power projects, including projects we have committed to acquire, with a total owned capacity of 2,942 MW in the United States, Canada, Japan and Chile that use proven and best-in-class technology. Each of our projects has contracted to sell all or a majority of its output pursuant to long-term, fixed-price power sale agreements (PSAs), some of which are subject to price escalation. Ninety-two percent of the electricity to be generated by our projects will be sold under our PSAs which have a weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 14 years as of December 31, 2017. 
We were organized in the state of Delaware in October 2012. We issued 100 shares in October 2012 to Pattern Renewables LP, a 100% owned subsidiary of Pattern Development 1.0 and subsequently in October 2013 conducted an initial public offering. 
Our Relationship with the Pattern Development Companies
Pursuant to the MSA, certain of our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, also are shared executives of the Pattern Development Companies and devote their time to both us and the Pattern Development Companies as is prudent in carrying out their executive responsibilities and fiduciary duties. In December 2016, certain investment funds managed by Riverstone Holdings LLC, which own interests in Pattern Development 1.0, engaged in a transaction in which (a) certain assets of Pattern Development 1.0 consisting principally of early and mid-stage U.S. development assets (including the Grady, Stillwater Big Sky, Crazy Mountain and Ishikari projects which are Identified ROFO Projects) were transferred to a newly formed entity, Pattern Development 2.0, and (b) Pattern Development 1.0 retained the remainder of its assets consisting principally of the other Identified ROFO Projects, non-U.S. development assets, and its ownership interest in our Class A common stock. The purpose of the transaction was to facilitate additional long-term capital raises by Pattern Development 2.0 to support the growth in the development pipeline. We also entered into other agreements with Pattern Development 2.0 which were amended and restated in June 2017 and relate to the relationships among us and the Pattern Development Companies, including relating to purchase rights, service agreements and competition. 
In 2017, we acquired approximately 21% ownership of Pattern Development 2.0. In February 2018, we made an additional contribution of $35.2 million pursuant to a Pattern Development 2.0 capital call, of which approximately $27 million was used toward Pattern Development 2.0's purchase of GPI. We have also committed to contribute up to an additional $197.5 million to Pattern Development 2.0 in one or more subsequent rounds of financing, which could result in our ownership interest in Pattern Development 2.0 increasing up to 29%. If we do not participate in such subsequent rounds of financing, our ownership interest in Pattern Development 2.0 may be diluted on a pro rata basis based on fair market value. 
As of December 31, 2017, Pattern Development 1.0 owned approximately 7.5% of our outstanding Class A common stock. Our continuing relationship with the Pattern Development Companies provides us with access to a pipeline of acquisition opportunities. We believe the Pattern Development Companies’ focus on project development combined with our Project Purchase Rights will complement our acquisition strategy, which focuses on the identification and acquisition of operational and construction-ready power projects and investment in development companies.
Our Relationship with PSP Investments
In June 2017, we entered into a strategic joint venture agreement with PSP Investments. The joint venture agreement provides that PSP Investments has the right to co-invest alongside us, up to an aggregate amount of approximately $500 million, in energy projects we may acquire from the Pattern Development Companies, cooperate with us to complete third-party acquisitions (including possibly arranging for or providing bridge loans and construction financing), and we may add a person that has been designated by PSP Investments to our board of directors. In 2017, we, together with PSP Investments, acquired the Meikle Wind Energy Project from Pattern Development 1.0. In addition, in 2017, we sold a portion of our interest in the Panhandle 2 wind project to PSP Investments. This relationship provides us the ability to increase our portfolio with limited capital investment. In 2018, we expect to acquire Mont Sainte-Marguerite (MSM), together with PSP Investments from Pattern Development 1.0. PSP Investments is also an investor in Pattern Development 2.0. Additionally, in June 2017, PSP Investments acquired 8.7 million shares, or approximately 9.9%, of our outstanding Class A common

Structure of Our Company
Industry 
Wind and solar power have been two of the fastest growing sources of electricity generation in North America and globally over the past decade. In 2016, growth in solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity was larger than any other form of generation with 75 gigawatts (GW) of solar installed, bringing the installed PV capacity to 303 GW worldwide and representing 1.8% of global electricity demand. In 2017, 
8

global installed wind capacity grew by nearly 11%, bringing the global total to 540 GW. Projections by the International Energy Agency indicate renewable energy will continue to grow at a faster rate than fossil fuels over the next two decades.
Growth in the industry is largely attributable to the increasing cost competitiveness of wind and solar energy relative to other power generation technologies and public support for renewable energy driven by energy security and environmental concerns. The 11th annual report by Lazard on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for electricity-generating technologies shows renewables are the cheapest available sources of electricity even without government incentives. Globally, the LCOE for both utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind technologies are down approximately 6% from 2016. This is a trend confirmed by similar analyses of wind and solar costs by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Given increased demand, falling costs, and the inherent stability of the cost of renewable energy sources, we believe that our markets present substantial growth opportunities. We require a relatively small share of a very large market to meet our growth objectives, and we believe we will achieve growth through the acquisition of operational and construction-ready projects from the Pattern Development Companies and other third parties.
Our Current Markets
The United States remains the second largest growth market for renewables in the world. In 2016, total wind power capacity in the United States reached 82,634 MW, representing 8% of installed capacity and approximately 6% of total electricity demand. Solar energy capacity reached 41,825 MW, representing 4% of installed capacity and 1% of total electricity demand. Government incentives contribute to the competitiveness of renewable energy by providing accelerated depreciation, tax credits for a portion of the development costs, decreasing the costs associated with developing, and creating demand for renewable energy assets through state renewable portfolio standard (RPS) programs. Additionally, demand has been increasing from commercial and industrial customers, such as major consumer brands and universities, and from the voluntary utility market. Nearly half of Fortune 500 companies and 63% of Fortune 100 companies have at least one climate or clean energy target. The Energy Information Administration expects these demand drivers to push renewable energy to 18% of electricity sales by 2030. State RPSs, specifically, are expected to drive an annual average increase of 4 GW of installed renewables capacity, with 18 GW added by 2020 and 55 GW by 2030.
The Canadian wind power industry has experienced dramatic growth in recent years, with installed capacity growing by an average of 15% per year during the last five years. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, installed wind power was 12,108 MW at the end of 2016, representing 9% of installed capacity in the country and 3% of energy generation. Clean energy policy occurs mostly at the provincial level. Alberta’s new Renewable Electricity Program is expected to drive development of at least 4,000 MW of new wind energy capacity by 2030, contributing to the expectation that demand met by renewable sources will triple from 9% today to 30% during this timeframe. Saskatchewan aims to have wind energy meet 30% of its electricity generating capacity by 2030, adding about 1,600 MW of new wind capacity.
In February 2018, we entered the Japan renewable energy market by committing to the acquisition of three wind projects, two of which are under construction, and two solar projects for a total owned capacity of 206 MW in Japan. In addition, we increased our investment in Pattern Development 2.0 in connection with its acquisition of a controlling interest in Green Power Investments (GPI), a well-established operating and development management team in Japan. Roughly 15% of Japan’s power needs were met by renewable energy in 2016. Wind and solar energy accounted for 6% of total generation and 18% of installed capacity, with 3,230 MW of wind power and 45,596 MW of solar power. Following the nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in 2011, the Japanese government has placed a greater emphasis on the development of renewable resources, aiming to have 22 to 24% of Japan's power generated by renewable energy by 2030. This effort was supported by the introduction of a Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) program in 2012 that offered fixed-term, fixed-price contracts for up to 20 years to renewable power projects. Recently, the fixed-price for large solar projects has been replaced with a reverse auction system that has a bid floor set at Japanese Yen (JPY) 21 per kWh. The tariff prices for wind power remain fixed until March 2020, with an onshore wind tariff of JPY21 per kWh and an offshore wind tariff of JPY36 per kWh. As such, there remains a strong incentive for continued investment in the Japanese renewables market.
At the end of 2016, renewables represented 12% of all generation, with wind and solar representing 6% of generation in Chile. There was a total of 1,159 MW of wind power and 1,612 MW of solar power, totaling 12% of Chile’s installed capacity. Chile introduced a time sub-block system for power auctions in 2014, which creates opportunities for wind and solar to take advantage of the times of the day when available natural resources match the country’s energy needs. Mining operations in the country are energy-intensive and represent a large source of demand. The copper industry alone accounted for 29% of total energy generated in 2015. Relief from curtailment of renewables that has occurred since 2015 is expected in 2018 from the interconnection of Chile’s largest two system operators.

Our Developing Markets
The Pattern Development Companies are actively working in Mexico, and we expect to add Mexican projects to the Identified ROFO Projects list in the future. Mexico’s Congress has enacted sweeping reforms to its electric generation industry in recent years, opening new opportunities for private investment in generation and creating a mandate to obtain at least 35% of its generation from clean sources by 2024. The Ministry of Energy estimates an additional 13.41 GW of wind and solar during this period, representing an average annual addition of 871 MW per year for wind power and 804 MW per year for solar. The government expects energy demand to increase 2.9% annually over the next fifteen years. In this period, wind is expected to grow by 13 GW and solar by 8 GW. At the end of 2016, wind and solar energy accounted for 3% of total generation and 5% of installed capacity, with 3,468 MW of wind power and 349 MW of solar power.
The map below provides a depiction of our projects and Identified ROFO Projects geographically:
Our Core Values and Financial Objectives
We intend to maximize long-term value for our stockholders in an environmentally responsible manner and with respect for the communities in which we operate. Our business is built around three core values of creative energy and spirit, pride of ownership and follow-through, and a team first attitude, which guide us in:

• | creating a safe and high-integrity work environment for our employees;


• | applying rigorous analysis to all aspects of our business in a timely, disciplined and functionally integrated manner to understand patterns in wind regimes, technology developments, market trends and regulatory, financial and legal constraints; and


• | working proactively with our stakeholders to address environmental and community concerns, which we believe is a socially responsible approach that also benefits our business by reducing operating risks at our projects.

10

Our financial objectives, which we believe will maximize long-term value for our stockholders, are to: 

• | produce stable and sustainable cash available for distribution;


• | selectively grow our project portfolio and our dividend per Class A share of common stock; and


• | maintain a strong balance sheet and flexible capital structure.

Our Business Strategy
To achieve our financial objectives while adhering to our core values, we intend to execute the following business strategies:
Maintaining and Increasing the Value of Our Projects
We intend to efficiently operate our projects to meet projected revenue and cash available for distribution. We expect to maximize the long-term value of our projects by focusing on value-oriented project availability (by ensuring our projects are operational when the wind is strong and power sale agreement prices are at their highest) and by regularly scheduled and preventative maintenance. We believe that good operating performance begins with a long-term maintenance program for our equipment. We also seek to improve performance or lower operating costs by working closely with our equipment vendors and considering contracting with third parties for maintenance, when appropriate.
We believe it is important to employ our own personnel in aspects of our business that we deem critical to the value of our projects. We have entered into revised long-term turbine manufacturer service arrangements at certain of our projects pursuant to which the turbine manufacturer will continue to provide routine and corrective maintenance service, but we would become responsible for a portion of the maintenance and repairs, including on major component parts. We expect to continue entering into similar arrangements at other projects in the future. We employ on-site personnel, maintain a 24/7 operations control center to monitor our projects and control all critical aspects of commercial asset management.
Selectively Growing Our Business
Our strategy for growth is focused on the acquisition of operational and construction-ready power projects from the Pattern Development Companies and other third parties that, together such measured investments into the development business, we believe will contribute to the growth of our business and enable us to increase our dividend per share of Class A common stock over time. We expect that projects we may acquire in the future will represent a logical extension of our existing business and be consistent with our risk profile, and that any incremental assumption of risk will require commensurate expectations of higher returns. As a result, our near-term growth strategy will remain focused on largely contracted cash flows with creditworthy counterparties and operating or in-construction projects.
We expect that opportunities will continue to arise from our relationship with the Pattern Development Companies, which provide us with the opportunity to acquire projects as they develop, construct and achieve commercial operations at these projects. Additionally, the investment in Pattern Development 2.0 supports growth in Pattern Development 2.0's development pipeline.
From time to time, we may also consider the disposal of a project, particularly if we believe we can utilize funds realized from such a disposal in a more productive manner or generate a higher return on investment.
Maintaining a Prudent Capital Structure and Financial Flexibility
We intend to maintain a conservative approach to our capital structure to protect our ability to meet our financial obligations, pay our regular dividends and to fund investments for future growth. Power projects by their nature require significant capital investment, and as a result, we seek to protect our business through careful management of our capital structure.
The foundation of our capital structure is built on project finance arrangements intended to ensure risk segmentation across our large project portfolio, and our practice has been to structure our project finance arrangements comprised of a mix of debt, tax equity and equity to conform to investment grade-like credit standards. Specifically, we seek to structure our project finance arrangements to:

• | match assets with liabilities based on a project’s off-take tenor and currency denomination;


• | fix or hedge project debt on a long-term basis;


• | amortize our third party project finance capital within the tenor of the off-take arrangement; and


• | apply conservative debt service coverage or tax equity structuring standards.

11

Our project capital structure is supplemented with a corporate capital layer that primarily relies on equity capital. Our corporate indebtedness, which includes unsecured senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million which we issued in January 2017 (the 2024 Unsecured Senior Notes), is modest, and intended to ensure broad capital access. In addition, our strategic partnership with PSP Investments is intended to expand capital access and improve flexibility in managing capital requirements. 
We seek to ensure financial flexibility and stability through our corporate revolving credit facility, maturity staging, minimization of interest rate exposure, and maintenance of our credit ratings. Our foreign currency denominated project dividends are further managed through a short-to-medium term foreign exchange program. We believe this approach, together with a strategic consideration of project-level financial restructuring and recapitalization opportunities, will contribute to our ability to maintain and, over time, increase our cash available for distribution.
Working Closely with Our Stakeholders
We believe that close working relationships with our various stakeholders, including suppliers, power sales agreement counterparties, regulators, the local communities where we are located and environmental organizations and with the Pattern Development Companies and other developers enable us to best support our existing projects and will help us access attractive, construction-ready projects.
Competition
We compete with other wind and solar power, infrastructure funds and renewable energy companies, as well as conventional power companies, to acquire profitable construction-ready and operating projects. In addition, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and regulation considered from time to time by federal, state, provincial and local legislatures and administrative agencies.
Competitive Strengths
We believe we compete with other industry participants by having high quality projects which are positioned to generate stable long-term cash flows which in turn give us access to low-cost project-level debt and strong stakeholder relationships. Some of the key attributes of our projects include long-term fixed priced power sale agreements, a geographically diverse market with varying wind and solar regimes and regulatory environment; and state-of-the-art wind turbines and solar panels. Further contributing to our competitive strength is our approach to project selection which focuses on the acquisition of projects that are operational and have long term power sales agreements with creditworthy counterparties. We believe our relationship with the Pattern Development Companies provides us with access to a pipeline of acquisition opportunities that also supplements our competitive strengths. Pattern Development 1.0's ownership interest in us is 7.5%.
 Our Projects 
We hold interests in 25 wind and solar power projects, including projects which we have committed to acquire, with a total owned capacity of 2,942 MW in the United States, Canada, Japan and Chile that use proven and best-in-class technology. Each of our projects has contracted to sell all or a majority of its output pursuant to long-term, fixed-price PSAs, some of which are subject to price escalation. Each of our projects has gone through a rigorous vetting process to meet our investment and our lenders’ financing criteria. As a result, our projects generally have the following characteristics:

• | multi-year on-site wind and solar data analysis tied to one or more long-term wind and solar energy reference sources;


• | long-term PSAs designed to ensure a predictable revenue stream;


• | contractually secured real estate property and easement rights for a period well in excess of the project’s expected useful life and contractual obligations;


• | a firm right to interconnect to the electricity grid through interconnection agreements, which define the cost allocation and schedule for interconnection, as well as any upgrades required to connect the project to the transmission system;


• | long-term, limited-recourse, amortizing project financing designed to match the long-lived nature of our power projects and the related power sales agreements;


• | secured construction and operating permits and other requisite federal, state or provincial and local permits, and regulatory approvals;


• | fixed-price turbine supply and construction contracts with guaranteed completion dates;

12


• | an operations and maintenance service program based on our own on-site personnel and central operations management as well as equipment warranties (for at least the first two years of operation) and service arrangements with qualified providers experienced in wind and solar project maintenance (including in some instances our internal operations group); and


• | safety, environmental and community programs to support our existing projects and relationships in the communities in which we operate.

Identified Right of First Offer Projects
Our continuing relationship with the Pattern Development Companies provides us with access to a pipeline of acquisition opportunities. Currently, the Pattern Development Companies have a more than a 10 GW pipeline of development projects, which are subject to our right of first offer. We target achieving a total owned or managed capacity of 5,000 MW by year end 2020 through a combination of acquisitions from the Pattern Development Companies and other third parties capitalizing on the large and fragmented global renewable energy market. Our business is primarily focused in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and Chile; however, we expect opportunities in Mexico will form part of our growth strategy.
Below is a summary of the Identified ROFO Projects that we expect to acquire from Pattern Development 1.0 and Pattern Development 2.0 in connection with our Project Purchase Rights:

In the event we believe we can utilize funds that have already been invested in Chile or funds that might otherwise be invested in Chile in a more productive manner elsewhere that could generate a higher return on investment, we may decide to exit Chile for other opportunities with greater potential. In addition, Pattern Development 1.0 is also concurrently exploring strategic alternatives for its assets in Chile.

Government Incentives and Tax Credits
Renewable energy sources in the United States have benefited from various federal and state governmental incentives, such as production tax credits and investment tax credits. Production tax credits and investment tax credits for wind energy on the federal level were extended in December of 2015, under the Consolidated Appropriations Act which extended the expiration date for tax credits for wind facilities commencing construction, with a five-year phase-down beginning for wind projects commencing construction after December 31, 2014. 
Hedging Activity
Most of our revenue is subject to long-term PPAs. To the extent that PPAs are not available in a given market, but market prices allow for acceptable project economics, we will enter into hedging agreements to obtain a fixed price for the energy output of our projects, typically by hedging volumes that are expected to be exceeded 99.0% of the time. Those hedging agreements are executed for a monthly or hourly production profile that matches the forecasted production profile of the project. 
Most of our interest rate exposure is hedged either through fixed-rate debt arrangements or hedging of floating rate loans. We enter into interest rate hedging agreements to convert floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt for some of our projects, usually at the time we close 
15

construction or term financing of a project. We also monitor our corporate-level interest rate exposure and may, from time to time, enter into interest rate hedges to mitigate our exposure. 
We have a currency risk management program. The objective of the program is to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk arising from transactions or cash flows that have a direct or underlying exposure in non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies in order to reduce volatility in our cash flow, which may have an adverse impact to our short-term liquidity or financial condition.

(2) | We have also committed to acquire in Japan the Futtsu Solar, Kanagi Solar, Otsuki, Ohorayama and Tsugaru projects which we expect to close in early to mid 2018.

Other important suppliers include engineering and construction companies, such as M. A. Mortenson Company, RES-Americas and Blattner Energy, Inc., with whom we contract to perform civil engineering, electrical work and other infrastructure construction for our projects.
While we do self-perform some turbine service and maintenance activities, the majority of our service work is currently performed by the original equipment manufacturers, primarily Siemens-Gamesa and General Electric. Both of these providers are industry leaders in the renewable service business. As described elsewhere, while we expect over time to increase self-perform activities, we do expect to continue to utilize both original equipment manufacturers and qualified independent service companies for a substantial amount of our service and maintenance needs.
Regulatory Matters 
Our operations are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies, including, but, not limited to, the following:
17

U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
Our current projects in operation in the United States are operating as Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs) as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, as amended, (PUHCA) and therefore are exempt from certain regulation under PUHCA. Other than Gulf Wind, Panhandle 1, Panhandle 2, and Logan’s Gap, our operating projects in the United States are, however, public utilities under the Federal Power Act subject to rate regulation by FERC. Our future projects in the United States will also likely be subject to such rate regulation once they are placed into service. Our projects in the United States that are subject to FERC rate regulation are required to obtain acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of energy (i.e., not retail sales to consumers), capacity and ancillary services, including their ability to charge “market-based rates.”
Independent System Operators (ISOs)
Most of our North American projects are located in regions in which the wholesale electric markets are administered by ISOs and Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). 
North American Electric Reliability Corporation
All of our current operating projects located in North America are also subject to the reliability standards of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). If we fail to comply with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. 
Regulatory Matters - Canada
All of our current operating projects in Canada are subject to exclusive provincial regulatory authority with respect to the generation and production of electricity, which varies across provincial jurisdictions. In Canada, activities related to owning and operating wind projects and participating in wholesale and retail energy markets are regulated at the provincial level. In Ontario, for example, electricity generation facilities must be licensed by the Ontario Energy Board and may also be required to complete registrations and maintain market participant status with the IESO, in which case they must agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions of the market rules for the Ontario electricity market as well as the mandatory reliability standards of the NERC.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are required to comply with various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These existing and future laws and regulations may impact existing and new projects, require us to obtain and maintain permits and approvals, comply with all environmental laws and regulations applicable within each jurisdiction and implement environmental, health and safety programs and procedures to monitor and control risks associated with the construction, operation and decommissioning of regulated or permitted energy assets, all of which involve a significant investment of time and resources. Existing initiatives and rules, some of which could potentially have a material effect (either positive or negative) on us, are as follows: 
Avian/Bat Regulations and Wind Turbine Siting Guidelines
We are subject to numerous environmental regulations and guidelines related to threatened and endangered species and their habitats, as well as avian and bat species, for the ongoing operations of our facilities. Environmental laws in the U.S., including the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act as well as similar environmental laws in Canada (such as the Species at Risk Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Endangered Species Act of 2007), among others, provide for the protection of migratory birds, eagles and bats and endangered species of birds and bats and their habitats. In addition to regulations, voluntary wind turbine siting guidelines established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service set forth siting, monitoring and coordination protocols that are designed to support wind development in the U.S. while also protecting both birds and bats and their habitats.
Regulation of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions
The U.S. Congress and certain states and regions, as well as the Government of Canada and its provinces, have taken and continue to take certain actions, such as finalizing regulation or setting targets and goals, regarding the reduction of GHG emissions and the increase of renewable energy generation.

Environmental Matters— Domestic
We are required to obtain a range of environmental permits and other approvals to build and operate our projects, including, but not limited to, those described below from U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities. In addition to being subject to these regulatory requirements, we could experience and have experienced significant opposition from third parties when we initially apply for permits or when there is an appeal proceeding after permits are issued. The delay or denial of a permit or the imposition of conditions that are costly or difficult to comply with can impair or even prevent the development of a project or can increase the cost so substantially that the project is no longer attractive to us.
Federal Clean Water Act
Frequently, our U.S. projects are located near wetlands, and we are required to obtain permits under the Clean Water Act for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands and streams. The Clean Water Act also requires that we mitigate any loss of wetland functions and values that accompanies our activities, obtain permits under the Clean Water Act for water discharges, such as storm water runoff associated with construction activities, and to follow a variety of best management practices to ensure that water quality is protected and impacts are minimized. 
Federal Bureau of Land Management Permits
As some of our U.S. projects are located on lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management, we are required to obtain rights-of-way from the Bureau of Land Management. The Bureau of Land Management encourages the development of wind power within acceptable areas, consistent with Environmental Policy Act of 2005 and the Bureau of Land Management’s energy and mineral policy. 
National Environmental Policy Act 
Our U.S. projects may also be subject to environmental review under the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all "major federal actions" significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The granting of a land lease, a federal permit or similar authorization for a major development project, or the interconnection of a significant private project into a federal project generally is considered a "major federal action" that requires review under NEPA. As part of the NEPA review, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife, historical and archaeological resources, geology, socioeconomics and aesthetics and alternatives to the project. A federal agency may decide to deny a permit based on its environmental review under NEPA, though in most cases a project would be redesigned to reduce impacts or agree to provide some form of mitigation to offset impacts before a denial is issued.
National Historic Preservation Act
U.S. federal agencies consider a project’s impact on historical or archeological resources under the U.S. National Historic Preservation Act and may require us to conduct archeological surveys or take other measures to protect these resources. The National Historic Preservation Act requires federal agencies to evaluate the impact of all federally funded or permitted projects on historic properties (buildings, archaeological sites, etc.)
Other State and Local Programs
In addition to federal requirements, our U.S. projects, and any future U.S. projects we may acquire, are subject to a variety of state environmental review and permitting requirements. Many states where our projects are located, or may in the future be located, have laws that require state agencies to evaluate a broad array of environmental impacts before granting state permits. The state environmental review process often resembles the federal NEPA process and may be more stringent than the federal review. Our projects also often require state law based permits in addition to federal permits. 
Our projects also are subject to local environmental and regulatory requirements, including county and municipal land use, zoning, building and transportation requirements. Local or state regulatory agencies may require modeling and measurement of permissible sound levels in connection with the permitting and approval of our projects. Local or state agencies also may require us to develop decommissioning plans for dismantling the project at the end of its functional life and establish financial assurances for carrying out the decommissioning plan.
19

Environmental Matters—Canada
We are required to obtain a range of environmental permits and other approvals to build and operate our Canadian projects, including, but not limited to, those described below from Canadian federal, provincial and local governmental authorities. In addition to being subject to these regulatory requirements, we could experience and have experienced significant opposition from third parties, including, but not limited to, environmental non-governmental organizations, neighborhood groups, municipalities and First Nations when the permits were initially applied for or when there is an appeal proceeding after permits are issued. The delay or denial of a permit or the imposition of conditions that are costly or difficult to comply with can impair or even prevent the development of a project or can increase the cost so substantially that the project is no longer attractive to us.
Ontario Renewable Energy Approvals
Our projects in Ontario are subject to Ontario’s Environmental Protection Act, which requires proponents of significant renewable energy projects to obtain a Renewable Energy Approval (REA). The REA application requires a variety of studies on environmental, archeological and heritage issues. Significant public consultation, as well as consultation with indigenous communities, is also required. Before issuing a REA, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment evaluates a broad range of potential impacts, including on wildlife, wetlands and water resources, communities, scenic areas, species and heritage resources, as well as impacts on people. This review can be time consuming and expensive, and an approval can be rejected or approved with conditions that are costly or difficult to comply with. REAs are also subject to appeal by third parties and can result and have resulted in lengthy appeal tribunal hearings.
Quebec Environmental Impact Assessment
Quebec`s Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a required permit for wind energy projects with a nameplate capacity above 10 MW. The EIA requires a variety of studies related to environmental, archeological and heritage issues. Significant public consultation, as well as consultation with indigenous communities, is also required. The culmination of this permitting process is the issuing of a project specific decree by the provincial council of ministers. Before issuing the decree, the Quebec Ministry of Environment evaluates a broad range of potential impacts, including on wildlife, wetlands and water resources, communities, scenic areas, species and heritage resources, as well as impacts on people. 
Quebec Commission for the Protection of Agricultural Land
In addition to the EIA process, the other major permit in Quebec is granted by the Quebec Commission for the Protection of Agricultural Land. This permit is only required on land that is zoned agricultural. This permitting body will push proponents to minimize footprints during both the construction phase and the operations phase. 
Manitoba Environment Act
The Manitoba Environment Act requires proponents of significant projects to submit a proposal with the Manitoba Conservation Environmental Assessment & Licensing Branch, and to comply with Manitoba’s environmental assessment process under the Environment Act. This process will consider a similar range of impacts on the environment, the heritage and scenic values of an area and on people, communities and wildlife as the Ontario process, and brings with it similar risks.
Endangered Species Legislation
Our Canadian renewable energy projects may be subject to endangered species legislation, either federally or provincially, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for harming endangered or threatened species and their habitats. Our projects may also be subject to the Migratory Birds Convention Act, which protects the habitat of migratory species, and which may also trigger federal "Species at Risk" requirements. Because the operation of wind turbines may result in injury or fatalities to birds and bats, avian and bat risk assessments are generally required both prior to permits being issued for projects and after commercial operations. In Ontario, if any of the affected species are listed as endangered or threatened, permits under the Endangered Species Act may also be required.
Other Approvals
Our Canadian projects, and any future projects we may acquire, are subject to a variety of other federal, provincial and municipal permitting and zoning requirements. Most provinces where our projects are located or may be located have laws that require provincial agencies to evaluate a broad array of environmental impacts before granting permits and approvals. These agencies evaluate similar issues as the permitting regimes above, including impact on wildlife, historic sites, aesthetics, wetlands and water resources, scenic areas, endangered and threatened species and communities. In addition, federal government approvals dealing with, among other things, aeronautics, 
20

fisheries, navigation or species protection may be required and could in some cases trigger additional environmental assessment requirements. Additional requirements related to the permitting of transmission lands may be applicable in some cases. Our projects are also subject to certain municipal requirements, including land use and zoning requirements except where superseded by Ontario’s Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009, as well as requirements for building permits and other municipal approvals that can be difficult or costly to comply with and impair or prevent the development of a project.
Environmental Matters – Chile
We are required to obtain a range of environmental permits and other approvals from various governmental agencies in Chile to build and operate our projects, including, but not limited to, items described below.
Ministry of Environment 
The Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the formulation and implementation of environmental policies, including those affecting the wind industry, plans and programs, as well as for the formulation of environmental quality and emission standards, the protection and conservation of biological diversity, renewable natural resources and water resources, and for promoting sustainable development and the integrity of environmental policy and regulations.
 Environmental Assessment Service
The Environmental Assessment Service is responsible for assessing whether projects that might have an adverse effect on the environment, including wind projects, comply with Chilean environmental laws and regulations. 
Superintendency of Environment
The Superintendency of the Environment’s primary responsibilities are monitoring compliance with the terms of the corresponding environmental licenses, as well as monitoring compliance with government plans to prevent environmental damage or to clean or restore contaminated geographical areas. The Superintendency of the Environment has the power to suspend activities that it deems to have an adverse environmental impact, even if such activities comply with a previously approved environmental impact assessment. In case of noncompliance with environmental regulations, it is enabled to apply fines, revoke the environmental license of a project or determine its closure.
The Environmental Courts, and Health and Safety
The Environmental Courts are principally responsible for hearing appeals of determinations made by the Superintendency of the Environment and for adjudicating claims for environmental damage.
Companies in the wind energy sector, like all companies, must comply with the general principles concerning employee health and safety contained in the Chilean Sanitary Code, Labor Code and other labor and health regulations. The Chilean Health Ministry and the Department of Labor are responsible for the enforcement of those standards, with the authority to impose fines among other sanctions. In addition, the Superintendence of Electricity and Fuels has the responsibility to monitor compliance and also the authority to impose fines and stop operations of violators.
Management, Disposal and Remediation of Hazardous Substances
We own and lease real property and may be subject to requirements regarding the storage, use and disposal of petroleum products and hazardous substances, including spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements. If our owned or leased properties are contaminated, whether during or prior to our ownership or operation, we could be responsible for the costs of investigation and cleanup and for any related liabilities, including claims for damage to property, persons or natural resources. That responsibility may arise even if we were not at fault and did not cause or were not aware of the contamination. In addition, waste we generate is at times sent to third-party disposal facilities. If those facilities become contaminated, we and any other persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at those sites may be jointly and severally responsible for the costs of investigation and remediation, as well as for any claims for damage to third parties, their property or natural resources.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 210 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by any collective bargaining agreement.
