The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview
We operate one of the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuits in the United States, consisting of 7,267 screens in 561 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2016, with approximately 211 million attendees for the year ended December 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2016"). Our geographically diverse circuit includes theatres in 46 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas. We develop, acquire and operate multi-screen theatres primarily in mid-sized metropolitan markets and suburban growth areas of larger metropolitan markets throughout the United States.
For fiscal 2014 and prior periods, the Company's fiscal year ended on the first Thursday after December 25, which in certain years (such as fiscal 2014) resulted in a 53-week fiscal year. Beginning January 2, 2015, the Company's fiscal year changed from a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the first Thursday after December 25 of each year to a fiscal year ending on December 31 of each year. 
For fiscal 2016, we reported total revenues, income from operations and net income attributable to controlling interest of $3,197.1 million, $339.4 million and $170.4 million, respectively. In addition, we generated $410.5 million of cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2016. 
Business Strategy
Our business strategy is predicated on our ability to allocate capital effectively to enhance value for our stockholders. This strategy focuses on enhancing our position in the motion picture exhibition industry by capitalizing on prudent industry consolidation and partnership opportunities, managing, expanding and upgrading our existing asset base with new technologies and customer amenities and realizing selective growth opportunities through new theatre construction. Our business strategy should enable us to continue to produce the free cash flow necessary to maintain a prudent allocation of our capital among dividend payments, debt service and repayment and investment in our theatre assets, all to provide meaningful value to our stockholders. Key elements of our business strategy include:
Maximizing Stockholder Value.    We believe that our cash dividends are an efficient means of distributing value to our stockholders. From our initial public offering ("IPO") in May 2002 through December 31, 2016, we have returned approximately $4.2 billion to our stockholders in the form of quarterly and extraordinary cash dividends. During our most 
4

recent five year period, we returned approximately $1.0 billion to our stockholders in quarterly and extraordinary cash dividends.
Pursuing Prudent Acquisitions and Maximizing Strategic Partnerships.    We believe that our acquisition experience and capital structure position us well to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities and to participate in various partnership initiatives. We intend to selectively pursue accretive theatre acquisitions and theatre-related investments that enhance and more fully utilize our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
With respect to partnership initiatives, we own approximately 19.7% of National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia" or "NCM") as of December 31, 2016. National CineMedia operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America and focuses on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC Entertainment, Inc. ("AMC"), and Cinemark, Inc. ("Cinemark"). See "National CineMedia Joint Venture" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia. We also participate in other joint ventures and partnerships such as Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC ("DCIP"), Open Road Films, AC JV, LLC ("AC JV"), Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition ("DCDC") and Atom Tickets, LLC ("Atom Tickets"), which are also further discussed under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K. We believe our investment in National CineMedia and other joint venture arrangements generate incremental value for our stockholders. 
Pursuing Premium Experience Opportunities.    We continue to embrace innovative concepts that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company and deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on several complementary fronts: 

• | First, we continued to improve customer amenities, primarily through the installation of luxury reclining seats. With respect to our luxury reclining seating initiative, as of December 31, 2016, we offered luxury reclining seating in 1,369 auditoriums at 113 theatre locations. We expect to install luxury reclining seating in approximately 40-45 locations during 2017 and expect to outfit approximately 45% of the total screens in our circuit by the end of 2019. The costs of these conversions in some cases are partially covered by contributions from our theatre landlords. 


• | Second, to address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have continued to expand our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products to an increasing number of attendees. The enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results, and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres. As of December 31, 2016, we offered an expanded menu of food in 216 locations (reaching approximately 53% of our fiscal 2016 attendees) and alcoholic beverages in 143 locations (reaching approximately 28% of our fiscal 2016 attendees), and we expect to offer an expanded menu of food in approximately 270 locations and alcoholic beverages in approximately 215 locations by the end of 2017. 


• | Third, we continued to implement various customer engagement initiatives aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for our customers in order to better compete for patrons and build brand loyalty. For example, we maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club®, to actively engage our core customers. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the national rollout of the new Regal Crown Club®. Members of the enhanced program can earn unlimited credits and can redeem such credits for movie tickets, concession items and movie memorabilia at the theatre or in an online reward center where members can select the rewards of their choice. We believe these changes allow us to offer more relevant offers to our members and increase customer engagement in the program. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 11.8 million active members in the Regal Crown Club®, making it the largest loyalty program in our industry. 


• | In addition, we continued to develop and enhance other customer engagement initiatives such as mobile ticketing applications, internet ticketing, social media and other marketing initiatives. For example, we have improved the customer experience of purchasing tickets by expanding our ability to sell tickets remotely via our mobile ticketing application and through our internet ticketing partners such as Fandango.com and Atom Tickets. Customers can choose their preferred ticketing option, which in many cases means they can pre-purchase tickets, scan their mobile device and proceed directly to their reserved seat without waiting in line. In addition to providing customers the ability to pre-purchase tickets, our mobile ticketing application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes, track Regal Crown Club® credits and receive special offers from Regal. Finally, at nearly one third of our locations, our newest ticketing partner, Atom Tickets, provides our patrons the ability to bypass concession stand lines by pre-purchasing concession items via their mobile device. We believe these technologies provide a platform for delivering a quality customer experience and will drive incremental revenues and cash flows in a more cost-effective manner. 


• | Finally, our IMAX® digital projection systems and our proprietary large screen format, RPXSM, offer our patrons all-digital, large format premium experiences and generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company. As of December 31, 2016, our IMAX® footprint consisted of 89 IMAX® screens, and we operated 93 RPXSM 

5

screens. We continue to selectively install RPXSM screens where we can generate a financial return, and we have recently agreed to install an additional 11 IMAX® digital projection systems, which will ultimately expand our IMAX® footprint to 100 screens. 
We believe the continued rollout of premium amenities such as luxury reclining seating, a wider array of food and alcoholic beverage offerings and IMAX® and RPXSM screens allow us to deliver a premium movie-going experience for a majority of our customers. We believe this strategy will enable us to better compete for patrons and build brand loyalty, which we believe will provide us the opportunity for incremental revenue and cash flows. 
Pursuing Selective Growth Opportunities and Active Asset Management.    We intend to selectively pursue expansion opportunities through new theatre construction, expansion and upgrades that meet our strategic and financial return criteria. Additionally, we manage our asset base by opportunistically closing underperforming theatres.  We continued to actively manage our asset base during fiscal 2016 by opening two theatres with 19 screens, reopening five screens at an existing theatre and closing 13 theatres and 118 screens, ending the year with 561 theatres and 7,267 screens. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to capitalize on future opportunities:
Industry Leader.    We are one of the largest domestic motion picture exhibitors operating 7,267 screens in 561 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia. Our geographically diverse circuit includes theatres in 46 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas. We believe that the quality and size of our theatre circuit is a significant competitive advantage for negotiating attractive national contracts and generating economies of scale. We believe that our market leadership allows us to capitalize on favorable attendance trends and attractive consolidation and partnership opportunities.
Superior Management Drives Strong Operating Margins.    Our operating philosophy focuses on efficient operations and strict cost controls at both the corporate and theatre levels. At the corporate level, we are able to capitalize on our size and operational expertise to achieve economies of scale in purchasing and marketing functions. We have developed an efficient purchasing and distribution supply chain that generates favorable concession margins. At the theatre level, management devotes significant attention to cost controls through the use of financial data analysis, detailed management reports and performance-based compensation programs to encourage theatre managers to deliver a premium customer experience while effectively controlling costs and maximizing free cash flow.
Proven Acquisition and Integration Expertise.    We have significant experience identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions of theatre circuits. Since our 2002 IPO, we have demonstrated our ability to enhance revenues and realize operating efficiencies through the successful acquisition and integration of nine theatre circuits, consisting of 230 theatres and 2,683 screens. We have generally achieved immediate synergies at acquired theatres and improved their profitability through the application of our consolidated operating functions and key supplier contracts, and our relationship with National CineMedia.
Quality Theatre Portfolio.    We believe that we operate one of the most modern theatre circuits among major motion picture exhibitors. Approximately 59% of our locations featured one or more premium amenity offerings as of December 31, 2016. We believe the continued rollout of premium amenities such as luxury reclining seating, a wider array of food and alcoholic beverage offerings and IMAX® and RPXSM screens allow us to deliver a premium movie-going experience for a majority of our customers. Finally, we believe that our modern theatre portfolio coupled with our operating margins should allow us to generate significant cash flows from operations. 
Dividend Policy
We believe that paying dividends on our shares of common stock is important to our stockholders. To that end, during fiscal 2016, we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $138.9 million in the aggregate. Further, on February 9, 2017, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock (including outstanding restricted stock), payable on March 15, 2017 to stockholders of record on March 3, 2017. Declared dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand. We, at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future. The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors. Dividends are considered quarterly and may be paid only when, and in such amounts as, approved by our Board of Directors.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW AND TRENDS
The domestic motion picture exhibition industry is a mature business that has historically maintained steady long-term growth in revenues and stable attendance. Since 1965, total box office revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5%, with annual attendance of approximately 1.3 billion attendees in 2016. Against this background of steady long-term growth in revenues, the exhibition industry has experienced periodic short-term increases and decreases in attendance and in turn box office revenues. Consequently, we expect the cyclical nature of the domestic motion picture exhibition industry to continue for the foreseeable future. However, we believe that long-term trends in motion picture attendance in the U.S. will continue to benefit the domestic motion picture exhibition industry. For example, during the most recent five-year period, attendance levels remained stable and the industry generated record box office results during 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016. 
Through the years, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry has experienced increased competition from other methods of delivering content to consumers including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television. Traditionally, when motion picture distributors license their films to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their products to other delivery channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window. Over the past several years, the average period between a film's theatrical release and its release in the next distribution channel has contracted slightly to approximately three to four months. Further, some film distributors have experimented with offering alternative distribution methods for certain films that rely on shorter theatrical release windows and in some cases, bypass the theatrical release altogether. We believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering. As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions. Fundamentally, we believe that movie-going is a convenient, affordable and attractively priced form of out-of-home entertainment, which, on an average price per patron basis, continues to compare favorably to other out-of-home entertainment alternatives, such as concerts and sporting events.
Finally, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry is in the process of implementing various initiatives, concepts and customer amenities aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its customers in order to better compete for patrons and build brand loyalty, which we believe will provide us the opportunity for incremental revenue and cash flows. These initiatives include luxury reclining seating, a wider array of food and beverage offerings, in-theatre dining and bar service, reserved seating, the enhancement of loyalty programs and other customer engagement initiatives such as mobile ticketing applications, internet ticketing, social media and other marketing initiatives. In addition, we believe the benefits associated with premium motion picture formats are significant for our industry and provide us with the opportunity for incremental revenue from formats such as IMAX® and our proprietary large screen format, RPXSM. Finally, we believe that operating a digital theatre circuit provides greater flexibility in scheduling our programming content, which has enhanced our capacity utilization, and enables us to generate incremental revenue from motion picture formats, such as digital 3D, and the exhibition of specialty content offerings through certain distributors, such as AC JV. We are optimistic that these and other recent industry initiatives and trends will drive continued growth and strength for the domestic motion picture industry. 
THEATRE OPERATIONS
We operate one of the largest theatre circuits in the United States with 7,267 screens in 561 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2016. We operate theatres in 46 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas. We target prime locations with excellent access to large, high patron-traffic areas. We operate our theatre circuit using our Regal Cinemas, United Artists, Edwards, Great Escape Theatres and Hollywood Theaters brands through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
We operate multi-screen theatres. Our multi-screen theatre complexes typically contain 10 to 18 screens, each with auditoriums ranging from 100 to 500 seats. As a result, our theatres appeal to a diverse group of patrons because we offer a wide selection of films and convenient show times. In addition, many of our theatres feature state-of-the-art amenities such as immersive sound, wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling screens, Sony Digital CinemaTM 4K projection systems, 3D digital projection systems, IMAX® and our proprietary large screen format, RPXSM, digital stereo surround-sound and enhanced interiors featuring video game and party room areas adjacent to the theatre lobby. Finally, we are in the process of implementing various other initiatives, concepts and customer amenities such as luxury reclining seating, a wider array of food and beverage offerings, in-theatre dining and bar service and reserved seating. 
Our modern, multi-screen theatres are designed to increase profitability by optimizing revenues per square foot while reducing our operational costs on a per attendee basis. We vary auditorium seating capacities within the same theatre, allowing us to exhibit films on a more cost effective basis for a longer period of time by shifting films to smaller auditoriums to meet changing attendance levels. In addition, we realize significant operating efficiencies by having common box office, concessions, projection, lobby and restroom facilities, which enable us to spread some of our costs, such as payroll, advertising, 
7

rent and utility costs over a higher revenue base. We strategically schedule movie show times to reduce staffing requirements and box office and concession line congestion and to provide more desirable parking and traffic flow patterns. We also actively monitor ticket sales in order to quickly recognize demand surges, which enables us to add seating capacity quickly and efficiently. In addition, we offer various forms of convenient ticketing methods, including print-at-home technology, self-serve kiosks, e-gift cards and mobile and internet ticketing. We believe that operating a theatre circuit consisting primarily of modern theatres enhances our ability to attract patrons and believe theatres larger than the current 10 to 18 screen megaplex are not able to generate attractive returns in most locations because of the substantial market suitability requirements to generate a level of profitability similar to the current megaplex format.

We have implemented a best practices management program across all of our theatres that provides daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly management reports for each individual theatre, and we maintain active communication between the theatres, divisional management and corporate management. We use these management reports and communications to closely monitor admissions and concessions revenues as well as accounting, payroll and workforce information necessary to manage our theatre operations effectively and efficiently.
We seek experienced theatre managers and require new theatre managers to complete a comprehensive training program within the theatres and at the "Regal Entertainment University," which is held at our corporate office. The program is designed to encompass all phases of theatre operations, including our operating philosophy, policies, procedures and standards. In addition, we have an incentive compensation program for theatre-level management that rewards theatre managers for controlling operating expenses while complying with our operating standards.
In addition, we have implemented quality assurance programs in all of our theatres to maintain clean, comfortable and modern facilities and monitor food service. To maintain quality and consistency within our theatre circuit, district and regional managers and various contractual service partners regularly inspect each theatre and provide recurring feedback. In addition, we consistently solicit feedback from our patrons through an on-line guest experience program whereby our guests rate and provide detailed comments regarding their experiences at our theatres. Finally, we also conduct a "mystery shopper" program, which involves unannounced visits by unidentified customers who report on the quality of service, film presentation and cleanliness at individual theatres.
NATIONAL CINEMEDIA JOINT VENTURE
We maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America representing over 20,500 U.S. theatre screens (of which approximately 20,100 are part of National CineMedia's digital content network) as of December 31, 2016. During 2016, over 700 million patrons attended movies shown in theatres in which National CineMedia currently has exclusive cinema advertising agreements in place. National CineMedia focuses on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC and Cinemark. 
We receive theatre access fees and mandatory distributions of excess cash from National CineMedia. Pursuant to our Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time, common units of National CineMedia held by Regal, AMC and Cinemark will be adjusted up or down through a formula primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each joint venture partner. As of December 31, 2016, we held approximately 27.1 million common units of National CineMedia. On a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.7% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 31, 2016. 
During fiscal 2013, National CineMedia sold its "Fathom Events" business to AC JV, a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company owned 32% by each of RCI, AMC and Cinemark and 4% by National CineMedia. The Fathom Events business markets and distributes live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to various theatre operators (including us, AMC and Cinemark) to provide additional programs to augment their feature film schedule and includes events such as live and pre-recorded concerts, opera and symphony, DVD product releases and marketing events, theatrical premieres, Broadway plays, live sporting events and other special events. 
See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia and related transactions, including AC JV.
DIGITAL CINEMA IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS JOINT VENTURE
We maintain an investment in DCIP, a joint venture company formed by Regal, AMC and Cinemark. DCIP funds the cost of digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us. DCIP’s initial and second round of financing substantially covered the cost of conversion to digital projection for our entire circuit. In addition to its U.S. digital deployment, DCIP actively manages the deployment of over 1,800 digital systems in Canada for Canadian Digital Cinema Partnership, a joint venture between Cineplex Inc. and Empire Theatres Limited. 
The Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, all of our screens were fully outfitted with digital projection systems. Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of DCIP.

OPEN ROAD FILMS, DCDC AND ATOM TICKETS JOINT VENTURES
We maintain an investment in Open Road Films, a film distribution company jointly owned by us and AMC. Open Road Films was created to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios’ big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner, which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theatres. Open Road Films distributed seven films and generated national box office revenues of approximately $107.0 million during 2016 and intends to distribute approximately six to eight films per year. The Company has committed to a cash investment of $30.0 million in Open Road Films, and as of December 31, 2016, the Company has funded a total of $28.3 million of its initial $30.0 million commitment. The carrying value of the Company's investment in Open Road Films as of December 31, 2016 was $(1.7) million. 
The Company is a party to a joint venture with certain exhibitors and distributors called DCDC. DCDC has established a satellite distribution network that distributes digital content to theatres via satellite. The Company has an approximate 14.6% ownership in DCDC as of December 31, 2016. The carrying value of the Company's investment in DCDC was approximately $2.8 million as of December 31, 2016.
Finally, we maintain an investment in Atom Tickets, an internet ticketing partner of the Company. At nearly one third of our locations, Atom Tickets provides our patrons the ability to bypass concession stand lines by pre-purchasing concession items via their mobile device. The carrying value of the Company's investment in Atom Tickets was approximately $5.0 million as of December 31, 2016.
Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of Open Road Films, DCDC and Atom Tickets. 
FILM DISTRIBUTION
Domestic movie theatres are the primary initial distribution channel for domestic film releases. The theatrical success of a film is often the most important factor in establishing its value in other film distribution channels. Motion pictures are generally made available through several alternative distribution methods after the theatrical release date, including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television. A strong theatrical opening often establishes a film's success and positively influences the film's potential in these downstream distribution channels. As the primary distribution mechanism for the public's evaluation of films, we believe that domestic theatrical distribution remains the cornerstone of a film's overall financial success. 
The development of additional distribution channels has given motion picture producers the ability to generate a greater portion of a film's revenues through channels other than its theatrical release. Historically, this potential for increased revenue after a film's initial theatrical release has enabled major motion picture studios and some independent producers to increase the budgets for film production and advertising.
FILM EXHIBITION
Evaluation of Film.    We license films on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis by negotiating directly with film distributors. Prior to negotiating for a film license, we evaluate the prospects for upcoming films. Criteria we consider for each film may include cast, producer, director, genre, budget, comparative film performances and various other market conditions. Successful licensing depends greatly upon the exhibitor's knowledge of trends and historical film preferences of the residents in markets served by each theatre, as well as the availability of commercially successful motion pictures.
Access to Film Product.    Films are licensed from film distributors owned by major production companies and from independent film distributors that distribute films for smaller production companies. Film distributors typically establish geographic licensing zones and allocate each available film to one theatre within that zone.
In licensing zones where we are the sole exhibitor, we obtain film licenses by selecting a film from among those films being offered and negotiating directly with the distributor. In zones where there is competition, a distributor may allocate films among the exhibitors in the zone or choose to offer their films to some or all exhibitors in the zone. When films are licensed under the allocation process, a distributor will select an exhibitor for each film who then negotiates film rental terms directly with the distributor.
Film Rental Fees.    Film licenses typically specify rental fees or formulas by which rental fees may be calculated. The majority of our arrangements use a "sliding scale" formula. Under a sliding scale formula, the distributor receives a percentage of the box office receipts using a pre-determined and mutually agreed upon film rental template. This formula establishes film rental predicated on box office performance and is the predominant formula used by us to calculate film rental fees. To a much lesser extent, we have also used a "firm term" formula and a "review or settlement" method where either (1) the exhibitor and distributor agree prior to the exhibition of the film on a specified percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the 
11

distributor or (2) the exhibitor and distributor negotiate a percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor upon completion of the theatrical engagement. 
Duration of Film Licenses.    The duration of our film licenses are negotiated with our distributors on a case-by-case basis. The terms of our license agreements depend on performance of each film. Marketable movies that are expected to have high box office admission revenues will generally have longer license terms than movies with more uncertain performance and popularity.
Relationship with Distributors.    Many distributors provide quality first-run movies to the motion picture exhibition industry. We license films from each of the major distributors and believe that our relationships with these distributors are good. For fiscal 2016, films shown from our top ten film distributors accounted for approximately 95% of our admissions revenues. Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor's motion pictures in any given year. In 2016, our largest single distributor accounted for 26.8% of our box office admissions. 
CONCESSIONS
In addition to box office admissions revenues, we generated approximately 29.2% of our total revenues from concessions sales during fiscal 2016. We emphasize prominent and appealing concession stations designed for rapid and efficient service. We continually seek to increase concessions sales by actively managing concession line congestion, optimizing product mix and through expansion of our concession offerings, introducing special promotions from time to time and offering employee training and incentive programs to up-sell and cross-sell products. We have favorable concession supply contracts and have developed an efficient concession purchasing and distribution supply chain. We have historically maintained strong brand relationships and management negotiates directly with these manufacturers for many of our concession items to obtain competitive prices and to ensure adequate supplies.
 To address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have continued to expand our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products to an increasing number of attendees. The enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results, and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres. As of December 31, 2016, we offered an expanded menu of food in 216 locations (reaching approximately 53% of our fiscal 2016 attendees) and alcoholic beverages in 143 locations (reaching approximately 28% of our fiscal 2016 attendees), and we expect to offer an expanded menu of food in approximately 270 locations and alcoholic beverages in approximately 215 locations by the end of 2017. 
COMPETITION
The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive. Motion picture exhibitors generally compete on the basis of the following competitive factors:

• | ability to secure films with favorable licensing terms;


• | availability of customer amenities (including luxury reclining seating), location, reputation, stadium seating and seating capacity;


• | quality of projection and sound systems;


• | appeal of our concession products; and


• | ability and willingness to promote the films that are showing.

We have several hundred competitors nationwide that vary substantially in size, from small independent exhibitors to large national chains such as AMC and Cinemark. As a result, our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the regions in which they operate. Our competitors, including newly established motion picture exhibitors, may build new theatres or screens in areas in which we operate, which may result in increased competition and excess capacity in those areas. If this occurs, it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As one of the largest motion picture exhibitors, however, we believe that we will be able to generate economies of scale and operating efficiencies that will give us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors. As discussed in "Industry Overview and Trends" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry is in the process of implementing various initiatives and concepts aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its customers in order to better compete for patrons and build brand loyalty. We are optimistic that these and other recent industry initiatives and trends will drive continued growth and strength for the domestic motion picture industry. To that end, our market share may be positively or negatively impacted by such initiatives and trends during any given fiscal period.

We also compete with other motion picture distribution channels including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television. Other technologies could also have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other distribution channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window. Over the past several years, the theatrical release window has contracted to approximately three to four months. Further, some film distributors have experimented with offering alternative distribution methods for certain films that rely on shorter theatrical release windows and in some cases, bypass the theatrical release altogether. We believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering. As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
In addition, we compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
MARKETING AND ADVERTISING
Currently, film distributors organize and finance multimedia advertising campaigns for major film releases. To market our theatres, we utilize internet, mobile and social media, print and multimedia advertising to inform our patrons of film selections and show times. In many of our markets, we employ special interactive marketing programs for specific films and concessions items.
Our frequent moviegoer loyalty program, Regal Crown Club®, is designed to actively engage our core customers and is the largest loyalty program in our industry. Through the Regal Crown Club®, we seek to enhance the customer experience and increase the frequency and amounts of purchases to generate additional revenue. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the national rollout of the new Regal Crown Club®. Members of the enhanced program can earn unlimited credits and can redeem such credits for movie tickets, concession items and movie memorabilia at the theatre or in an online reward center where members can select the rewards of their choice.  We believe these changes allow us to provide more relevant offers to our members and increase customer engagement in the program. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 11.8 million active members in the Regal Crown Club®, and these members accounted for approximately $1.1 billion of the Company's box office and concession revenues during fiscal 2016. Our mobile ticketing application, designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone® or Android™ phone, has been downloaded approximately 6.1 million times since its fiscal 2012 launch. The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes and special offers from Regal and the ability to purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process. Additionally, the application helps customers stay up-to-date on the latest coupons and Regal Crown Club® loyalty program promotions. 
In addition, we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs such as summer children's film series and promotions within local communities. 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS
Information Technology ("IT") is focused on the customer experience and supporting the efficient operation of our theatres, the management of our business and other revenue-generating opportunities. The revenue streams generated by attendance and concession sales are fully supported by information systems to monitor cash flow and to detect fraud and inventory shrinkage. We have implemented software and hardware solutions which provide for enhanced capabilities and efficiency within our theatre operations. These solutions have enabled us to sell gift cards at various major retailers, grocery and warehouse stores and to redeem those gift cards at our theatre box offices and concession stands. 
We continue to focus on improving the customer experience of purchasing tickets by expanding our ability to sell tickets remotely via our mobile application and through our internet ticketing partners such as Fandango.com and Atom Tickets, and self-service alternatives, such as ticketing kiosks and print-at-home ticketing.  Customers can choose their preferred ticketing option, which in many cases means they can pre-purchase tickets, scan their mobile device and proceed directly to their reserved seat without waiting in line.  In addition to providing customers the ability to pre-purchase tickets, our mobile application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes, track Regal Crown Club® credits and receive special offers from Regal.  Lastly, at nearly one third of our locations, our newest ticketing partner, Atom Tickets, provides our patrons the ability to bypass concession stand lines by pre-purchasing concession items via their mobile device. These technologies provide a platform for delivering a quality customer experience and will drive incremental revenues and cash flows in a more cost-effective manner. 
In addition, we continue to strategically pursue technologies to improve the services we provide to our patrons and to provide information to our management allowing them to operate our theatres efficiently.  Our scheduling systems support the

coordination needed to properly allocate our auditoriums between film showings and meetings and events, while also ensuring that movie audiences view the intended advertising and that revenue is allocated to the appropriate business function. The scheduling systems also provide scheduling information electronically and automatically to media outlets, including newspapers and various online media outlets to drive attendance in our theatres. The sales and attendance information collected by the theatre systems is used directly for film booking and settlement as well as provides the primary source of data for our financial systems.
SEASONALITY
 The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next fiscal quarter or any other fiscal quarter. Historically, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and the holiday season. The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional trend. The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.

REGULATION
The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases. Consent decrees effectively require major film distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Consequently, exhibitors cannot assure themselves of a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a film-by-film basis.
Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA. Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled. We intend to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we do not currently anticipate that compliance will require us to expend substantial funds.
Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some of the information in this Form 10-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, certain statements under "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" may constitute forward-looking statements. In some cases you can identify these forward-looking statements by words like "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of those words and other comparable words. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these statements as a result of certain risk factors as more fully discussed under "Risk Factors" below.
