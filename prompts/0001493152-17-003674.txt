ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We manufacture processors that produce fuel products mainly from unsorted, unwashed waste plastics for distribution across a number of markets. We continue to execute on our business strategy with the goal of becoming a leading manufacturer of processors and other related equipment that transform waste plastic into ultra-clean, ultra-low sulphur fuel.
 
Our plastic-to-oil, or P2O, business is a commercial manufacturing and production business. We plan to grow mainly from the sale of P2O processors, and secondarily from the sale of fuel products. We provide environmentally-friendly solutions through our processors and technologies. Our primary offering is our Plastic2Oil®, or P2O®, solution, which is our proprietary process that converts waste plastic into fuel through a series of chemical reactions (our “P2O business”). We are able to collect mainly mixed plastics from commercial and industrial enterprises that generate large amounts of waste plastic for use in our process. Generally, this waste plastic would otherwise be sent to landfills and its disposal potentially can be quite costly for companies. We are able to use this waste plastic as feedstock to produce Fuel Oil No. 2, Naphtha, and Fuel Oil No. 6 for various uses by our customers. Fuels we produce can be sold through two main distribution channels, fuel wholesalers and directly to commercial and industrial end-users.


At April 7, 2017, we had three fully-permitted, P2O processors at our Niagara Falls, NY facility and have the capability to produce and store the fuels at, and ship from, such facility,. However, it is our strategy to license our P2O technology and know-how to license partners for their use in producing fuel for their own operations directly from the waste plastics that such licensees generate from their own operations.
 
Of our three P2O processors, one is dedicated to research and development and two dedicated to fuel production during pilot runs for customer demonstration. We have components for two additional processors, Nos. 4 and 5, which are in process of assembly for future sale. For the reasons described in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our three P2O processors have been idle since late December 2013 and assembly of processors #4 and #5 has been suspended.
 
For financial reporting purposes, we operate in two business segments, (i) our P2O business, which manufactures and sells processors, and sells fuel produced by our processors and (ii) data storage and recovery (the “Data Business”). As part of our P2O business segment, we began to offer for sale built-to-order P2O processors for use at a customer’s site. Previously, we operated a chemical processing and cleaning business, known as Pak-It and a retail and wholesale distribution business known as Javaco, Inc. As of December 31, 2012, we had exited both of these businesses and their results in all periods presented are classified as discontinued operations. As of the filing date of this report, our processors were idle and not producing fuel products. Our P2O processors have not been operating since December 2013 and we anticipate that this line of business will account for a majority of our revenues in 2017 and periods thereafter. Historically, however, our revenues have been partially derived from our other lines of business and products, Javaco and Pak-It, which are classified in this Annual Report as discontinued operations. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we had total sales of approximately $21,950, of which $0 were derived from our P2O business and $21,950 were derived from our Data Business. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we had total sales of $0 from our P2O business and $10,397 from our Data Business.


We conduct our P2O business at our facilities located in Niagara Falls, New York. Our corporate address is 20 Iroquois Street, Niagara Falls, NY 14303.

Organizational History
 
We were incorporated on April 20, 2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name 310 Holdings Inc. (“310”). On April 24, 2009, the Company’s founder, former CEO and Chief of Technology, John Bordynuik, purchased 63% of the issued and outstanding shares of 310 and became our chairman and chief executive officer. On June 25, 2009, we purchased certain assets from John Bordynuik, Inc., a corporation founded by Mr. Bordynuik. The assets acquired included tape drives, computer hardware, servers and a mobile data recovery container to read and transfer data from magnetic tapes. From inception until August 2009, we were a shell company within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. On August 24, 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Javaco, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Domark International, Inc. On September 30, 2009, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Pak-It, LLC. We formed JBI (Canada) Inc. on February 9, 2010 for purposes of distributing Pak-It products in Canada. We formed Plastic2Oil of NY, #1, LLC on May 4, 2010, for the development and commercialization of our Plastic2Oil business in Niagara Falls, NY.
 
On October 5, 2009, we changed our corporate name to JBI, Inc.
 
On August 24, 2009, the Company acquired Javaco, Inc. (“Javaco”), a distributor of electronic components, including home theater and audio video products. On July 9, 2012, we announced the closure of our Javaco operations and sold substantially all of its assets to an unrelated third party. In July 2012, the Company closed Javaco and sold substantially all its inventory and fixed assets. There were no operations in Javaco during 2016 and the remaining liabilities have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented (See Note 16).
 
In September 2009, the Company acquired Pak-It, LLC (“Pak-It”). Pak-It operated a bulk chemical processing, mixing, and packaging facility. It also developed and patented a delivery system that packages condensed cleaners in small water-soluble packages. . On February 10, 2012, we sold substantially all the assets of Pak-It. There were no operations in Pak-It during 2016, and the remaining liabilities have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented (See Note 16).


In December 2010, the Company entered into a twenty year lease for a recycling facility in Thorold, Ontario. During the period ended December 31, 2013, the Company determined that it would no longer operate the facility and shut down all operations. The assets and operations related to the recycling facility have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented (See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein). The property was vacated on November 10, 2015 and the lease was terminated on January 15, 2016 effective October 31, 2015.
 
On July 31, 2014, we changed our corporate name to Plastic2Oil, Inc. On January 6, 2015, we changed the names of our two Canadian subsidiaries from JBI (Canada) Inc. to Plastic2Oil (Canada), Inc., and from JBI RE ONE, Inc. to Plastic2Oil RE ONE, Inc.
 
Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Market under the symbol “PTOI”.

P2O Overview
 
Our business focus has been the manufacture and sale of processors that produce fuel products mainly from unsorted, unwashed waste plastics for distribution across a number of markets. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, neither manufacturing nor sales activity took place. We plan to grow mainly from the sale of processors, and secondarily from the sale of fuel products. We continue seeking opportunities to execute on our business strategy with the goal of becoming a leading North American company that sells processors to transform waste plastic into ultra-clean, ultra-low sulphur fuel. We have years of operating data and have solved numerous challenges that vexed the plastics-to-oil industry. Since inception we have produced approximately 670,000 gallons of fuel. Our P2O processors have evolved into a modular solution with the completion of our third P2O processor in 2013. We use third party contract manufacturers to supply us with many of the key modular components of our processors, including the kilns, distillation towers and other key components that require specialized machining and fabrication. As of the filing date of this report, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business which has forced us to suspend our operations until such time as we receive a capital infusion or cash advances on the sale of our processors. Processors are being used only for customer visits and for maintenance activities.
 
Our proprietary P2O process converts waste plastic into fuel through a series of chemical reactions. We developed this process in 2009 and began very limited commercial production in 2010 following our receipt of a consent order from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (“NYSDEC”) allowing us to commercially operate our first large-scale P2O processor at our Niagara Falls, New York facility. Currently, we have three fully-permitted P2O processors, which are capable of producing Naphtha, Fuel Oil No. 2 and Fuel Oil No. 6, all of which are fuels produced to the specifications published by ASTM. One fully-permitted P2O processor is dedicated to research and development activities. We have components for two additional processors at an outside vendor, which were impaired in the 4th quarter of 2016. Our P2O process is capable of producing two by-products, an off-gas similar to natural gas and a petcoke carbon residue. In instances when we produce and sell fuel products, we primarily use our off-gas product in our operations to fuel the burners in our P2O processors. Historically, we have sold our fuel products through two main distribution channels comprised of fuel wholesalers and directly to commercial and industrial end-users.

We shut down our fuel production late in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to severe cold weather that caused damage to condensers and other components of our processors and we have not resumed fuel production due to the repair costs as well as our shift in strategy toward manufacturing processors for sale, as opposed to producing and selling fuel products. Management estimates that the repair of the processors will require the expenditure of between $175,000 and $200,000. An additional $300,000 of startup working capital will be required to resume operations mainly for hiring operational personnel and incremental overhead expenses. At March 30, 2017, we lacked the working capital or access to bank credit to make these repairs. We are reviewing our financing options, including the sale of shares of our common stock or other securities, in order to allow us to obtain sufficient funds to make the required repairs and resume pilot operation of our processors to support processor sales. These processors were idle for all of 2016 and 2015. Management currently anticipates that the processors will remain idle other than pilot, or demo runs to support processor sales. During the idle period, we have significantly reduced our headcount by furloughing our operations personnel but retained a small team to perform general repairs and maintenance on the processors. Once the processors are fully operational, we expect a small increase in our headcount in order to resume fuel production for pilot or demo purposes.
 
Our P2O process accepts mainly unsorted, unwashed waste plastics. We believe our P2O process offers a cost-effective solution for businesses that currently have to pay to dispose of these types of waste. Although many sources of plastic waste are available, we have focused our feedstock sources on primarily post-commercial and industrial waste plastic. Generally, we believe that this waste stream is more costly for companies to dispose of, making it more readily available in large quantities and cheaper for us to acquire than other potential types of feedstock.
 
Currently, we understand that there are several plastic-to-oil processes operational globally. These other processes employ a wide range of technologies and yield varying purities of fuel output. We believe that our process has many advantages over many other commercially available processes in that our P2O solution requires a comparatively less initial capital investment and yields high-quality, ultra-low sulphur fuel, with no need for further refinement. Additionally, our process uses comparatively little energy and physical space, which, in our view, makes it well suited for high-volume production and expansion to multiple sites.
 
P2O Process and Operations
 
Our patent-pending P2O conversion process involves the cracking of the plastic hydrocarbon chains at ambient pressure and comparatively low temperature using a catalyst. There are various processes in existence for converting plastic and other hydrocarbon materials into products for use in the production of fuels, chemicals and recycled items. These processes include: pyrolysis (conversion using dry materials at high pressure and temperature in the absence of oxygen), catalytic conversion (conversion using a catalyst for stimulating a chemical reaction), depolymerization (conversion using superheated water and high pressure and temperature) and gasification (conversion at high temperature using oxygen or steam).
 
We have developed our P2O processors with the ability to be continuously running, energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly while converting waste plastics into end-user ready, and ultra-clean, ultra-low sulfur fuels. The processors are periodically shut-down for maintenance and residue removal during operations. The fuels produced can be used directly by our customers without further refining or processing. Over a three year development period from 2009-2012, we scaled our processing operations from a one gallon processor to three processors, each permitted to feed up to 4,000 pounds of feedstock per hour. In prior years, some of the milestones that we have reached include:
 

● | Manufacturing and operating multiple processors at our Niagara Falls, NY site; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | From inception, the processors were designed with safety and green emissions as top priorities; 
● | Standardization and modularization of the components of our processors; 
● | Ability to continuously feed waste plastic 24 hours a day; 
● | Approximately 86% of waste plastic by weight is converted to liquid fuel conversion; 
● | Approximately 8% of waste plastic by weight is converted to gas and is used to fuel the process; 
● | Operating at atmospheric pressure, not susceptible to pinhole leaks and other problems with pressure and vacuum-based systems;

● | No requirement for incinerators, thermal oxidizers or scrubbers and no stack monitoring is necessary; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Three stack tests (two on the initial processor and one on the second processor) conducted by Conestoga-Rovers & Associates (“CRA”), prove emissions are extremely low; 
● | Process validation by SAIC Energy, Environment & Infrastructure, LLC and IsleChem, LLC; and 
● | Permitted to operate three processors commercially in New York by the NYSDEC. 

Processor Input
 
Waste Plastics: We are able to feed mainly mixed unwashed waste plastics into the Plastic2Oil processors. Waste plastic is widely available and we are focused on maximizing the types and densities of the plastic we procure for optimal processor performance.
 
Heat Transfer Fluid: We are also able to include hydrocarbon based transfer fluid as feed into the P2O processors.
 
Processor Output
 
We are currently permitted to feed two tons, or 4,000 pounds, of waste plastic per hour into each processor by a continuous conveyor belt where it is heated by a burner that mainly burns off-gases produced from the P2O process. Plastic hydrocarbons are cracked into various shorter hydrocarbon chains and exit in a gaseous state. Any residue, metals and or non-usable substances remain in the reactor and are periodically removed. Through our proprietary process, Fuel Oil No. 6, Fuel Oil No. 2, and Naphtha are condensed from the reactor through the remainder of the process. The fuel output is then transferred to storage tanks automatically by the system. Our process is mainly operated by an automated computer system that controls the conveyor feed rate, system temperatures, off-gas systems and the pumping out of newly created fuel to storage tanks. The plastic to liquid fuel conversion is approximately 86% by weight. Therefore, twenty tons of plastic can be processed into approximately 4,100 gallons of fuel. At April 7, 2017, we had three processors at our Niagara Falls, NY facility. One processor was dedicated to research and development and all three processors remained idle due to maintenance and repair issues.
 
Fuel Produced: The fuel produced in our processors is ultra-low sulfur fuel and is ready for end-users without the need for further refinement.
 
Off-gas: Approximately 8-10% of waste plastics fed into the processors are converted to a mixture of hydrogen, methane, ethane, butane and propane gas, which we call “off-gas”. Once our processors are in a state to begin the P2O process, they use their own off-gas to fuel the burners in the process.
 
Residue: There is approximately 2-4% residue from our process, which is petroleum coke or carbon black (which we call “petcoke”) that needs to be removed on a periodic basis.
 
Feedstock
 
Our P2O process primarily uses post-commercial and industrial waste plastic that might otherwise be sent to a landfill by the commercial and industrial producers of such waste plastic. We believe that this can be costly for these producers due to the large volumes of plastic waste that they generate. As such, our business model is premised on the processor’s ability to accept numerous types of waste plastics from such sources at a relatively low cost. We believe that our processor ability to accept mainly mixed, unwashed waste plastics is a significant advantage of our P2O process compared to similar operations in our industry.
Fuel Products
 
Our P2O process makes both light and heavy fuel products which are Naphtha, Fuel Oil No. 2 and Fuel Oil No. 6, as defined by ASTM. Our process also generates two main by-products, a reusable off-gas similar to natural gas and a carbon residue known as petcoke.

10
--


Naphtha is a very light fuel product that is used as a cutting component for both high and regular grade gasoline. Fuel Oil No. 2 is a mid-range fuel commonly known as diesel and has numerous transportation, manufacturing and industrial uses. Fuel Oil No. 6 is a heavy fuel generally used in industrial boilers and ships. Our process produces high quality, ultra-low sulphur fuels, without the need for further refinement which enables fuel sales directly from the processors to the end-user.
 
The reusable off-gas that is produced by the P2O process is used to fuel the burner that heats the entire processor.
 
P2O Facilities
 
We currently have one main facility (located in Niagara Falls, NY) that we use in our P2O business, as well as a second facility, our fuel blending site (located in Thorold, Canada), for use in the future. These are briefly described below. Additional information on our properties can be found in Item 2 of this report.
 
Niagara Falls, NY facility: Our Niagara Falls, NY facility currently has two buildings, a 10,000 square foot building that currently houses one commercial-scale P2O processor and one P2O processor devoted to research and development activities, and a 7,200 square foot building housing the third commercial-scale P2O processor. Our Niagara Falls operations are situated on eight acres that can accommodate expansion of our operations. This facility also serves as the center of our research and development operations and our administrative offices.
 
Blending Site: We own a 250,000 gallon fuel-blending facility in Thorold, Ontario, Canada, which, when in use, would allow us to blend and self-certify certain fuels that are produced from our process to meet government specifications.
 
Sales and Distribution
 
Our P2O business is a commercial manufacturing and production business. We plan to grow mainly from sale of processors first, and fuel seller secondly.
 
Historically, we have sold our fuel products through two main channels: fuel brokers and direct to end-users. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no fuel sales.
Suppliers
 
The principal goods that we require for our P2O business are the waste plastic that we use as feedstock for production of our fuels. We collect waste plastics from commercial and industrial businesses that generate large amounts of this waste stream. As of April 7, 2017, we had approximately 327,000 pounds of waste plastic and approximately 10,000 gallons of heat transfer fluid available in inventory as feedstock for operations once operations are resumed.
 
We also rely on third party manufacturers for the manufacture of many components of our processors, including kilns and distillation towers.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, four and five suppliers, respectively, accounted for 28.3% and 30.9% of accounts payable, respectively.
 
Licenses, Permits and Testing
 
We maintain the following permits and licenses in connection with the operation of our P2O business.

In 2010, our P2O process and processors were tested by IsleChem, LLC, an independent chemical firm providing contract research and development, manufacturing and scale-up services, using two small prototypes of our P2O processor. The IsleChem test results indicated that our process is both repeatable and scalable. Following this testing, we assembled a large-scale P2O processor capable of processing at least 20 metric tons of plastic per day. In September 2010, we had a Stack Test performed by Conestoga-Rovers & Associates (“CRA”), an independent engineering and consulting firm, which concluded that, with a feed rate of 2,000 pounds of plastic per hour, our processor’s emissions were below the maximum emissions levels allowed by the NYSDEC simple air permit, which is needed to commercially operate the P2O processor at that location. We used the CRA test results to apply for the required operating permits and in June 2011 we received an Air State Facility Permit (“Air Permit”) and Solid Waste Management Permit (“Solid Waste Permit”) for up to three processors at the Niagara Falls, NY facility. In December 2011, we had a second stack test performed by CRA for an increased rate of 4,000 pounds per hour. In January 2012, we received a final emissions report from CRA confirming that emissions were considerably decreased with an increased feed rate. In December 2012, we had a stack test performed on the second processor.
 
The emissions tests conducted by CRA on our processors are summarized in the following table:
 

Emissions | Units1 | Original Stack Test (2010) – Processor #1 | | Final Stack Test (Dec. 2011) – Processor #1 | | Stack Test (Dec. 2012) – Processor #2

Industry Background
 
Alternative fuels are generally considered to be any substances that can be used as fuel, other than conventional fossil fuels such as naturally occurring oil, gas and coal. There have been many approaches taken to producing alternative fuels, including conversion of corn oil, vegetable oil and non-food-based materials. These approaches have demonstrated varying degrees of commercial potential. Some of the challenges that alternative fuel producers have faced include high feedstock supply costs, lower perceived value of fuel product, higher capital costs and dependence on government regulations for economic viabilities. We believe our company is distinguishable from other producers of alternative or renewable fuels because our P2O solution represents a process and product that is commercially viable and designed to provide immediate benefit for industries, communities and government organizations with waste plastic recycling challenges. Our business model is premised on the need for a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to disposing of waste plastic in jurisdictions where the cost of transporting and landfilling large amounts of plastic is quite costly.

Competition
 
Our P2O business has elements of both a recycling business and a fuel refiner/ production business, which makes it difficult to identify and make direct comparisons to competitors. Both the recycling and energy sectors are characterized by rapid technological change. Our future success will depend on our ability to achieve and maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances in both of these sectors. We believe that our business currently faces competition in the plastics-to-energy market, including competition from PK Clean, Green Envirotec Holdings LLC, and RES polyflow, each of which has developed alternative methods for obtaining and generating fuel from plastics. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business”. Because P2O solution end products include a variety of fuels, we also face competition from the broader petroleum industry.
Business Model
 
We believe that our business model provides a unique proposition for both the “supply side” and the “end-user” side of the waste-to-fuel value chain. Our P2O technology is positioned to link these two sides by offering economic incentives in both directions. We believe P2O offers value to suppliers of waste plastic by saving transport and landfill tipping fees, and value to fuel end-users by providing ultra-low sulphur green fuel. Given these incentives, we believe that our business will be sought after by those industries that can benefit from the added value that we provide, thus allowing the potential for our company’s growth through sale of processors.
Business Strategy
 
Our long-term strategy is to become the leading plastic-to-oil processor manufacturer. Our target customers for our processors are private companies and municipalities in the recycling industry who can operate on a commercial scale. Our targeted customers for fuel sales are fuel distributors. The existing processors that are used to demonstrate our technology and the processor capabilities, for process improvement, for research and development activities and to test potential customer feedstock. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are as follows:
Marketing Strategy
 
We target post-commercial and industrial waste plastic partners. We believe this allows us to identify sources of large plastic waste streams, such as industrial sites and material recovery facilities and recycling centers. We also seek to partner with businesses and municipalities that collect waste plastics. Our vision is to help redirect these waste plastic streams, preventing them from entering landfills.
Manufacturing and Procurement Strategy
 
Our P2O business model allows us to simultaneously pursue sales to multiple commercial opportunities (partners) across the waste plastic and fuel markets. Our P2O processors have evolved to be modular solutions with the completion of processor #3 in 2013. We use third party contract manufacturers for the manufacture of many of the key modular components of our processors, including the kilns, distillation towers as well as other key components that require specialized machining and fabrication. We will license our P2O technology, including construction operation and maintenance of processors for operation at our partners’ sites. Our strategy is to have our partners construct clusters of P2O processors at sources of large plastic waste streams, such as industrial sites, material recovery facilities and recycling centers.
Feedstock Procurement Strategy
 
Our feedstock strategy is as follows:
 

● | Get the Right Material to Maximize Throughput. Although the P2O processor can process many different types of plastic and create consistent fuels, we will focus on the types of plastic that will maximize the machine’s productivity. This is typically high density material. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Contract for Long-Term Consistent Feedstock Supply. By contracting with our suppliers, we are able to gain commitments for consistent flows of feedstock. This also allows us to more accurately forecast our feedstock supply and fuel outputs. An additional benefit of contracting with suppliers is that we are able to rely on this material flow as it relates to our continued growth planning. 
● | Cost to the Processor. We look at all feedstock opportunities considering the “cost to the processor”. This means we consider including the cost is the price we pay to the supplier, the cost of transportation or our costs to pre-process the feedstock material, the critical thing is the total cost incurred for “ready to process” material.

Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that our competitive strengths are as follows:
 
Our processors convert unwashed waste plastics into “in specification fuels” ready for use by the end-user customer. Our process does not generate any waste water. The fuel is Halide-free and there is no further need for refinement. The process does not produce any hazardous waste.
 
In addition to producing fuel, our P2O solution simultaneously addresses the problem of disposing of waste plastic. We offer an alternative to disposing of waste plastic in a landfill. Our processors can accept mainly mixed, unwashed plastic feedstock. In the United States and Canada, a substantial amount of plastic is currently considered waste and is disposed of in landfills, resulting in tipping fees levied by the landfill or other waste disposal facility fees. We believe that the current low landfill diversion rates for waste plastic in the United States and Canada, together with the costs of transporting and disposing of plastic in bulk, present a significant opportunity to provide an alternative to conventional recycling and waste disposal.
 
The P2O process provides a highly efficient means of converting plastic into fuel. Our proprietary P2O process and catalyst provide a highly efficient means of converting plastic into fuel. Our business model depends on us being able to provide both a cost-competitive means of disposing of waste plastic and an efficient and non-energy intensive means of producing fuel. Our process requires comparatively minimal electricity to operate, and the energy balance of the process is positive, meaning that more energy can be produced than is consumed by the process.
 
Low capital costs and small footprint. We have designed the processors with a modular design with standardized components, making construction of our processors relatively simple and cost effective. We have designed our processors to take up approximately 3,000 square feet of space, giving the processors a relatively small footprint. We believe that this design facilitates the construction and operation of multiple processors on a single site. We estimate that the costs of constructing our processors on industrial partner sites will be substantially less than the cost of constructing waste-to-fuel facilities offered by our competitors.
 
Lower emissions
 
In the United States, businesses and other producers of emissions are subject to various regulatory requirements, including the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or “NESHAP.” These emission standards may be established according to Maximum Achievable Control Technology requirements set by the EPA, often referred to as “MACT standards”. MACT standards apply to a number of sources of emissions, including operators of boilers, process heaters and certain solid waste incinerators. Because our P2O fuel products have ultra-low sulphur content, we believe that our P2O fuel can assist industrial partners with meeting MACT requirements through reduced hazardous emissions.
 
Our processors produce fuels that have very low sulphur content, which allows the end-user to potentially lower the emissions generated by its operations while using our fuels. These lower emissions potentially could save the end-user from expensive environmental compliance costs, stemming from such initiatives as the NESHAP regulations and more specifically the MACT standards for each pollution source.
 
Validation of repeatability and scalability of P2O processors.
 
Our P2O business has been validated for repeatability and scalability by extensive testing by our customers and multiple independent tests by outside consultants and third party laboratories.

Other Businesses
 
Data Recovery & Migration
 
In June 2009, we purchased certain assets from John Bordynuik, Inc., a corporation founded by John Bordynuik, our former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief of Technology and who now serves as a consultant to the company. The assets acquired from John Bordynuik, Inc. included tape drives, computer hardware, servers and a mobile data recovery lab to read and transfer data from magnetic tapes and these assets are used in our Data Recovery & Migration business.
 
Magnetic tapes were previously a primary media for data storage. Because of its cost effectiveness, magnetic tape was widely used by government, scientific, educational and commercial organizations for decades. Over time, these tapes can become vulnerable to deterioration when exposed to natural elements, which can render the tapes difficult to read or unreadable using the original tape-reading equipment. Our Data Business involves reading old magnetic tapes, interpreting and restoring the data where necessary and transferring the recovered data to storage formats used in current systems. The recovered data is verified for accuracy and returned to customers in the media storage format of their choice. Our process gives customers the ability to conveniently catalogue and safely archive difficult-to-retrieve data on readily accessible, contemporary storage media. Users of these services generally include businesses or organizations that have historically stored information on magnetic tape, such as government agencies, oil and gas companies and academic institutions.
 
The process for data recovery was developed and is very highly dependent on the services of Mr. Bordynuik. The Data Business’s reliance on Mr. Bordynuik was a key driver to achieving revenue in 2016 and 2015.


Intellectual Property
 
To ensure the protection of our proprietary technology, we have applied for patent protection for both the P2O process and P2O processor. As of April 7, 2017, no patents have been issued. (The application was published on January 1, 2015 under Publication No. US2015/0001061 and is available on the USPTO website at http://patft.uspto.gov/). Management anticipates filing additional patent applications for various aspects of our P2O process in the near future. A lack of patent protection could have a material adverse effect on our ability to gain a competitive advantage for our process and processors, since it is possible that our competitors may be able to duplicate the P2O process for their own purposes. We also rely on our trade secrets to provide protection from portions of our process and proprietary catalyst. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business”.
 
We also hold a U.S. patent relating to our Data Business for the recovery of tape information.

Research and Development
 
Given our strategic focus on developing our P2O business, we anticipate that our research and development activities related to our P2O processors and the construction, operation and systems management of those processors will decrease. Specifically, we will seek to increase the operational capabilities and performance of our P2O processors as opportunities arise. Research and development expenditures were $0 and $1,653 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Employees
 
As of April 7, 2017, we employed three and one half persons on a full-time equivalent basis, of which one is were executive management, one and one half were in finance and administration, one were in operations. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our labor relations are good.
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
 
As we seek to further develop and commercialize our P2O business, we will be subject to extensive and frequently developing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to those relating to emissions requirements, fuel production, fuel transportation, fuel storage, waste management, waste storage, composition of fuels and permitting. Compliance with current and future regulations could increase our operational costs. Management believes that the company is currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations and permitting.
 
Our operations require various governmental permits and approvals. We believe that we have obtained, or are in the process of obtaining, all necessary permits and approvals for the operations of our P2O business; however, any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits and approvals or to have the necessary approvals in place may adversely affect our operations and may subject us to penalties.

PLASTI2OIL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND GOING CONCERN
 
Plastic2Oil, Inc. (the “Company” or “P2O”) was originally incorporated as 310 Holdings, Inc. (“310”) in the State of Nevada on April 20, 2006. 310 had no significant activity from inception through 2009. In April 2009, John Bordynuik purchased 63% of the issued and outstanding shares of 310. During 2009, the Company changed its name to JBI, Inc. and began operations of its main business operation, transforming waste plastics to oil and other fuel products. During 2014, the Company changed its name to Plastic2Oil, Inc. (“P2O”). P2O is a combination of proprietary technologies and processes developed by P2O which convert waste plastics into fuel. P2O currently, as of the date of this filing, has two processors at its Niagara Falls, NY facility (the “Niagara Falls Facility”). Both processors are currently idle since December 2013. Our P2O business has begun the transition from research and development to a commercial manufacturing and production business. We plan to grow mainly from sale of processors.
 
We do not have sufficient cash to operate our business which has forced us to suspend our operations until such time as we receive a capital infusion or cash advances on the sale of our processors.
 
On August 24, 2009, the Company acquired Javaco, Inc. (“Javaco”), a distributor of electronic components, including home theater and audio video products. In July 2012, the Company closed Javaco and sold substantially all of the inventory and fixed assets of Javaco. The operations of Javaco have been classified as discontinued operations for the years presented (Note 16).
 
On September 30, 2009, the Company acquired Pak-It, LLC (“Pak-It”), and the operator of a bulk chemical processing, mixing, and packaging facility. It also has developed and patented a delivery system that packages condensed cleaners in small water-soluble packages. In February 2012, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of Pak-It and as a result, the operations of Pak-It have been classified as discontinued operations for the years presented (Note 17).
 
Going Concern
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern which assumes the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception, has net losses from continuing operations of $5,700,035, and $4,523,762 for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and has a working capital deficit of $6,429,753 and an accumulated deficit of $77,944,132, at December 31, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and to operate in the normal course of business. The Company has funded its activities to date almost exclusively from equity financings, loans form related party and issuance of secured long-term debt.
 
The Company will continue to require substantial funds to continue the expansion of its P2O business to achieve significant commercial productions, and to significantly increase sales and marketing efforts. Management’s plans in order to meet its operating cash flow requirements include financing activities such as private placements of its common stock, issuances of debt and convertible debt instruments.
 
While the Company believes that it will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, meet regulatory requirements and achieve commercial production goals, there are no assurances that such additional funding will be achieved and that it will succeed in its future operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Plastic2Oil of NY#1 Inc., Plastic2Oil (Canada) Inc., JBI CDE Inc., Plastic2Oil Re One Inc., JBI Re #1 Inc., Plastic2Oil Marine Inc., Javaco, and Pak-it. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Amounts in the consolidated financial statements are expressed in US dollars. Recycling Center, Pak-It and Javaco have also been consolidated; however, as mentioned their operations are classified as discontinued operations (Note 16).
Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates include amounts for impairment of long-lived assets, share based compensation, asset retirement obligations, inventory obsolescence, accrued liabilities, accounts receivable exposures and valuation of options and warrants.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has $270,898 and $18,488, respectively.
Restricted Cash
 
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had $100,423and $100,322, respectively, of restricted cash, which is used to secure a line of credit that secures a performance bond on behalf of the Company. The performance bond is required by the State of New York for fuel distributors in perpetuity.
Cash Held in Attorney Trust
 
The amount held in trust represents retainer payments the Company have made to law firms which were being held on our behalf for the payment of future services.
Accounts Receivable
 
Accounts receivable represent unsecured obligations due from customers under terms requesting payments upon receipt of invoice up to ninety days, depending on the customer. Accounts receivable are non-interest bearing and are stated at the amounts billed to the customer net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts. Customer balances with invoices over 90 days old are considered delinquent. Payments of accounts receivable are applied to the specific invoices identified on the customer remittance, or if unspecified, are applied to the earliest unpaid invoice.
 
The allowance for uncollectible accounts reflects management’s best estimate of amounts that may not be collected based on an analysis of the age of receivables and the credit standing of individual customers. The allowance for uncollectible accounts as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $22,994.

Inventories
 
Inventories, which consist primarily of plastics, costs to process the plastic and processed fuel are stated at the lower of cost or market. We use an average costing method in determining cost. Inventories are periodically reviewed for use and obsolescence, and adjusted as necessary. The inventories were fully reserved as of December 31, 2015.
Property, Plant and Equipment
 
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets, and capital leased assets are given useful lives coinciding with the asset classification they are classified as. These lives are as follows:

Leasehold improvements | lesser of useful life or term of the lease 
------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------
Machinery and office equipment | 3-15 years 
Furniture and fixtures | 7 years 
Office and industrial buildings | 25 -30 years 

 
Gains and losses on depreciable assets retired or sold are recognized in the statements of operations in the year of disposal. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred and expenditures that increase the value or useful life of the asset are capitalized.
 
Construction in Process
 
The Company capitalizes customized equipment built to be used in the future day to day operations at cost. Once complete and available for use, the cost for accounting purposes is transferred to property, plant and equipment, where normal depreciation rates are applied.
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
The Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets on an asset by asset basis. Impairment is recognized on properties held for use when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying amount at which time the property is written-down to fair value. Properties held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell. The sale or disposal of a “component of an entity” is treated as discontinued operations. The operating properties sold by the Company typically meet the definition of a component of an entity and as such the revenues and expenses associated with sold properties are reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented (Note 16).
 
During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded impairment losses on deposits and property, plant and equipment of $3,088,315 and $593,060, respectively, in accordance to ASC 360-10-50-2 where an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the long-lived assets are not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of equipment for impairment purposes using a discounted cash flow method.
 
Asset Retirement Obligations
 
The fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets when identified and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement cost, equal to the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation, is capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived asset. The balance of the asset retirement obligation is determined through an assessment made by the Company’s engineers, of the total costs expected to be incurred by the Company when closing a facility. The total estimated cost is then discounted using the current market rates to determine the present value of the asset as of the date of this valuation. As of the date of the creation of the asset retirement obligation in the amount of $57,530, the Company determined the present value of the obligation using a discount rate equal to 2.96%. The present value of the asset retirement obligation is then capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets and is depreciated over the asset’s estimated useful life and is included in depreciation and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Increases in the asset retirement obligation resulting from the passage of time are recorded as accretion of asset retirement obligations in the consolidated statements of operations. Actual expenditures incurred are charged against the accumulated obligation. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the asset retirement obligations were $64,000 and $41,000, respectively. These costs include disposal of plastic and other non-hazardous waste, site closing labor and testing and sampling of the site upon closure.

Environmental Contingencies
 
The Company records environmental liabilities at their undiscounted amounts on our balance sheets as other current or long-term liabilities when environmental assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. These costs may be discounted to reflect the time value of money if the timing of the cash payments is fixed or reliably determinable and extends beyond a current period. Estimates of our liabilities are based on currently available facts, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into consideration the likely effects of other societal and economic factors, and include estimates of associated legal costs. These amounts also consider prior experience in remediating contaminated sites, other companies’ clean-up experience and data released by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances. We capitalize costs that benefit future periods and we recognize a current period charge in operation and maintenance expense when clean-up efforts do not benefit future periods.
 
We evaluate any amounts paid directly or reimbursed by government sponsored programs and potential recoveries or reimbursements of remediation costs from third parties including insurance coverage separately from our liability. Recovery is evaluated based on the creditworthiness or solvency of the third party, among other factors. When recovery is assured, we record and report an asset separately from the associated liability on our balance sheets. No amounts for recovery have been accrued to date.
 
Deposits
 
Deposits represent utility services deposit and payments made to vendors for fabrication of key pieces of property, plant and equipment that have been made in accordance with the Company’s agreements to purchase such equipment. Payments are made to these vendors as progress is made on the fabrication of the equipment, with final payments made when the equipment is delivered. Until we have possession of the equipment, all payments made to these vendors are classified as deposits on assets.
Leases
 
The Company has entered into various leases for buildings and equipment. At the inception of a lease, the Company evaluates whether it is operating or capital in nature. Operating leases are recorded as expense in the appropriate periods of the lease. Capital leases are classified as property, plant and equipment and the related depreciation is recorded on the assets. Also, the debt related to the capital lease is included in the Company’s short- and long-term debt obligations, in accordance with the lease agreement (Note 8).
 
Lease inducements are recognized for periods of reduced rent or for larger than usual rent escalations over the term of the lease. The benefit of a rent free period and the cost of future rent escalations are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and collection is reasonably assured. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.

P2O processor sales are recognized when the customer take possession of the processors since title to the goods and the risk of loss transfers from P2O to Customer upon delivery. P2O fuel sales are recognized when the customers take possession of the fuel since at that stage the customer has completed all prior testing necessary for their acceptance of the fuel. At the time of possession they have arranged for transportation to pick it up and the sales price has either been set in their purchase contract or negotiated prior to the time of pick up through the issuance of a purchase order. The Company negotiates the pricing of the fuel based on the quality of the product and the type of fuel being sold (i.e. Naphtha, Fuel Oil No. 6 or Fuel Oil No. 2).
 
Data storage and recovery sales are recognized when the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer.
 
Shipping and Handling Costs
 
The Company’s shipping and handling costs of $0 and $147 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are included in cost of goods sold for the years presented. Shipping and handling costs are capitalized to inventory and expensed to cost of sales when the related inventory is sold for the years presented.
 
Advertising costs
 
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $0 and $1,868 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses – other, in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
Research and Development
 
Research and development costs are charged as operating expense of the Company as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company expensed $0 and $1,653, respectively, towards research and development costs. Components of the processors that are fabricated or purchased with research and development plans and then used on the processor in production are capitalized into the cost of the processor and depreciated over the remaining life of the processor.
Foreign Currency Translation
 
The consolidated financial statements have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 830. All monetary items have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. All non-monetary items have been translated using the historical exchange rates at the time of transactions. Income statement amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year. Resulting differences are immaterial to the financial statements as a whole. Foreign exchange loss of $100 and gain of $7,320 are included as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Income Taxes
 
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method to measure and record deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
The Company adopted the accounting standards associated with uncertain tax positions as of January 1, 2007. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations or financial position. Upon adoption, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. Furthermore, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company files tax returns in the U.S federal and state jurisdictions as well as a foreign country. The years ended December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2016 are open tax years for IRS review.

Loss Per Share
 
The financial statements include basic and diluted per share information. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during each period. Common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share when their effect is anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2016, potential dilutive common stock equivalents consisted 14,950,000 shares underlying common stock warrants and 6,650,000 shares underlying stock options, which were not included in the calculation of the diluted loss per share. For the year ended December 31, 2015, potential dilutive common stock equivalents consisted 14,350,000 shares underlying common stock warrants and 1,628,000 shares underlying stock options, which were not included in the calculation of the diluted loss per share because their effect is anti-dilutive.
Segment Reporting
 
The Company operates in two reportable segments. ASC 280-10, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in their annual consolidated financial statements. Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our operating segments include plastic to oil conversion (Plastic2Oil), which includes processor sales as well as fuel sales and Data Recovery and Migration, our magnetic tape reading segment. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.
Concentrations and Credit Risk
 
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of operating demand deposit accounts and accounts receivable. The Company’s policy is to place our operating demand deposit accounts with high credit quality financial institutions that are insured by the FDIC, however, account balances may at times exceed insured limits. The Company extends limited credit to its customers based upon their creditworthiness and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other pertinent information. The Company also routinely makes an assessment of the collectability of the short-term note receivable and determines its exposure for non-performance based on the specific holder and other pertinent information.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 100% of total net revenues were generated from a single customer and segment, Data Business. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, one customer and segment, Data Business, accounted for 100% of accounts receivable.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 four and five suppliers, respectively, accounted for 28.39% and 30.90% of accounts payable, respectively.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, leases, promissory notes, long-term debt and mortgage payable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.
Changes in Accounting Policies Including Initial Adoption
 
There are no recently adopted accounting pronouncements that impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Under this ASU and subsequently issued amendments, revenues are recognized at the time when goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. Based on our continuing assessment of the potential impact of this standard, we believe the adoption of this standard may impact the following:

● | Engagements that contain performance-based arrangements, in which the company will earn a success or completion fee when and if certain predefined outcomes occur; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Engagements with fixed-fees that have multiple performance obligations; and 
● | Engagements that include discounting arrangements. 

 
The Company has not completed the assessment and has not yet determined whether the impact of the adoption of this standard on the company’s consolidated financial statements will be material. The Company will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018 but have not yet concluded on a transition approach. The Company expects to complete their assessment , including selecting a transition method for adoption during the second half of 2017.
 
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This update requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent within a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. This update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early application is permitted as of the beginning of the interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
In July 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (“ASU 2015-11”). ASU 2015-11 requires that an entity measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This ASU does not apply to inventory measured using last-in, first-out. ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
In October 2016, Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which removes the prohibition against immediate recognition of current and deferred income tax effects on intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This standard is effective January 1, 2019, although early adoption is permitted as early as January 1, 2017. The Company has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which clarifies how cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows. This standard is effective January 1, 2018, although early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which clarifies how cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows. This standard is effective January 1, 2018, although early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This standard makes several modifications to Topic 718, including the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation, income tax consequences, and clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards, all of which are intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation. The ASU will require that the difference between the actual tax benefit realized upon option exercise or restricted share or restricted stock unit release and the tax benefit recorded based on the fair value of the stock award at the time of grant (the “excess tax benefits”) to be reflected as a reduction of the current period provision for income taxes with any shortfall recorded as an increase in the tax provision rather than as a component of changes to additional paid-in capital. The ASU will also require the excess tax benefit or detriment realized to be reflected as operating cash flows rather than financing cash flows. The standard is effective beginning January 1, 2017. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), that replaces existing lease guidance. Under this ASU, leases will be required to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective beginning January 1, 2019. The new standard is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented. The Company has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.


Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The Company calculates its income tax expense by estimating the annual effective tax rate and applying that rate to the year-to-date ordinary income (loss) at the end of the period. The Company records a tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that it will not be able to recover the value of its deferred tax assets. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company calculated its estimated annualized effective tax rate at 0% and 0%, respectively, for both the United States and Canada. The Company had no income tax expense on its $5,439,315 and $4,523,762 losses from continuing operations and $0 and $199,452 gain, from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued on uncertain tax positions as well as interest received from favorable tax settlements within interest expense. The Company recognizes penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits within selling, general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no uncertain tax positions.
 
The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. The years ended December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2016 are open tax years.

NOTE 9 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
Commitments
 
Plastic2Oil Marine, Inc., one of the Company’s subsidiaries, which is currently not operating, entered into a consulting service contract in 2010 with a company owned by the Company’s chief executive officer. The contract provides the related company with a share of the operating income earned from Plastic2Oil technology installed on marine vessels which are owned by the related company. The contract provides a minimum future payment equal to fifty percent of the operating income generated from the operations of two of the most profitable marine vessel processors and 10% from all other marine vessel processors. At December 31, 2016, there were no currently installed marine vessel processors pursuant to the contract.
 
At December 31, 2016, we recorded impairment loss $1,448,464 on the deposits in accordance to ASC 360-10-50-2 where an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the long-lived assets are not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The Company will be required to pay approximately $235,000 upon the delivery of these assets which is expected occur with the delivery of processor #4 and processor #5. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has committed to purchase certain pieces of key machinery from vendors related to the future expansion of its operations. In addition to the payments made to these vendors classified as deposits of $1,448,464 on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
 
The Company leased premises in Thorold, Ontario, Canada which was previously used in the operation Plastic2Oil (Canada), Inc. doing business as Regional Recycling of Niagara (“RRON”). During the third quarter of 2013, the Company determined that it would shut down the operations of RRON (Note 16). The employees of RRON were given notice of the shut down in the first week of September 2013, after which point the Company approached the landlord about terminating the lease; however, there was no formal termination as an agreement to terminate the lease was not reached. During September 2013, the Company was assessing its options with the facility, including potential sublease, but determined that a sublease of the facility was not permitted by the lease and officially decided to cease use of the premises as of September 30, 2013. Accordingly, the Company has applied September 30, 2013 as the cease-use-date in recognizing the liability for the contract termination costs. The total expense included in loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations is $188,343 for the year ended December 31, 2015 (Note 16). The property was vacated on November 10, 2015. On January 15, 2016, the Company entered into a Surrender of Lease agreement which terminated its lease, dated December 1, 2010, between Avondale Store Limited Properties and JBI, (Canada) Inc. relating to the Company’s premises located at 1786 Allanport Road, Thorold, Canada. The effective date of the termination was October 31, 2015. The premises was the site of the Company’s Regional Recycling Center, which was part of a business line that was discontinued by the Company in 2013. The Company anticipates the termination will save approximately $1,161,360 in lease payments over the original life of the lease which had a term ending on December 1, 2030. The Company will remain liable for unpaid rent of approximately $66,335 covering the period from May 2016 to October 2016.
 
Contingencies
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company is involved in litigation and claims which arise from time to time in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, based upon the information and facts known to them, any liability that may arise from such contingencies would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

The Company’s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision maker, and directs the allocation of resources to operating segments based on the profitability and cash flows of each respective segment.
 
The Company evaluates performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is net income. The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those described in “Note 2: Summary of Accounting Policies.” The following tables show the operations of the Company’s reportable segments:

Management monitors the soundness of these institutions and has not experienced any collection losses with these financial institutions.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 100% of total net revenues were generated from a single customer and segment, Data Business. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, one customer and segment ,Data Business, accounted for 100% of accounts receivable.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 four and five suppliers, respectively, accounted for 28.39% and 30.90% of accounts payable, respectively.
 
Contingencies
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company is involved in litigation and claims which arise from time to time in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, based upon the information and facts known to them, any liability that may arise from such contingencies would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
NOTE 16 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
 
Regional Recycling of Niagara
 
During the third quarter of 2013, the Company determined that, due to the significant losses incurred by Regional Recycling of Niagara, and the continuous need to fund their operations through the Company’s Plastic2Oil operations, that it would shut down the operations of the facility. The decision to do this was based on the following factors:

● | The inventory processed over the prior months at Regional Recycling of Niagara was comingled with contaminated materials that made the significant majority of their inventory worthless without significant additional processing and labor (Note 4); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The fixed assets utilized at the facility were old and beginning to become in need of significant repairs, which would have been a significant cost to maintain (Note 5); 
● | The pre-processing cost of plastic at Regional Recycling of Niagara was significant and was a hindrance to the Company becoming profitable on a cost per gallon of fuel basis; and 
● | The Company leases the Recycling Facility in Thorold, Ontario, Canada with terms remaining of up to 14 years (Note 16). 

 
The property was vacated on November 10, 2015 and the lease was terminated on January 15, 2016 effective October 31, 2015 with no penalty for early termination. This resulted in adjusting the short-term and long-term obligations set up in 2013 to zero, which resulted in a $195,044 income. The results of operations from Regional Recycling of Niagara for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 have been classified as discontinued operations and are as follows:
