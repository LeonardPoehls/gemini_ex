Corporate History
 
The Company was incorporated in Nevada on August 26, 2010, under the name “JA Energy,” as a subsidiary of Reshoot Production Company, a Nevada corporation, incorporated October 31, 2007. In May, 2011, Reshoot Production Company spun off the Company to its shareholders.
 
From August 2010 to May 2014 the Company was in the business of designing a suite of modular, self-contained, fully automated, climate controlled units for distributed production of energy. While some of these products were proven to be technologically viable, none were ever developed to the point where they were ready for introduction to the marketplace.
 
In October 2014, pursuant to the terms of an Irrevocable Asset and Liability Exchange Agreement, dated as of October 15, 2014, by and among the Company, James Lusk, Mark DeStefano and T.J. Jesky, the Company transferred all of its assets and liabilities to its wholly owned subsidiary, Peak Energy Holdings, a Nevada corporation (“Peak”) and Peak issued to the Company’s shareholders, one share of Peak common stock for each share of common stock owned in the Company and one share of Peak preferred stock for each share of preferred stock owned in the Company (the “Spin-Off”). Following the Spin-Off, Peak operated as an independent entity separate from the Company with new management. The Spin-Off allowed the Company to explore new business opportunities without the burden of the assets and liabilities on the corporate books.
 
In September 2016, the Company established its headquarters in Hong Kong, and issued 30,000,000 shares of unregistered restricted Class A Common Stock, 6,000,000 shares of unregistered restricted Class B Voting Common Stock, which carries a voting weight equal to ten (10) Common Shares, and 40,000,000 shares of unregistered restricted Class C Common Stock to UBI Blockchain Internet, LTD (“UBI Hong Kong”), in exchange for $200,000. UBI Hong Kong is beneficially owned and controlled by Tony Liu our CEO and as a result of the transaction UBI Hong Kong and Tony Liu became controlling shareholders of the Company. Thereafter, the Company’s business focus was dedicated to the application of the blockchain technology to safety issues arising out of counterfeit and inferior substitute products and services in the Chinese health industry.
 
On November 21, 2016, the Company changed its corporate name from JA Energy (“JA”) to UBI Blockchain Internet, LTD, and changed its state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware pursuant to a plan of conversion about which the Company adopted a new certificate of incorporation under the laws of the State of Delaware after UBI acquired a controlling equity in JA and this transaction was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposes.

Overview
 
UBI Blockchain Internet is a company focused on research & development and application of blockchain technology, including the combination of Internet of Things (“IoT”) and other high-tech technologies to health industry issues prevalent in China.
 
UBI’s business focus on blockchain technology is based on management’s persistent exploration and pursuit of solutions to prevent and eliminate the health industry issues prevalent in China, i.e. the safety issues of products and services caused by counterfeits and inferior substitutes resulting in harm to human lives. Entering the 21st century, with the rise of technology innovation and progress, especially with the emergence of the blockchain technology, our management determined that an opportunity was available to discover and apply blockchain based solutions to the problem of safety and counterfeits in health products and services.
 
UBI has established a dedicated R&D team, developed in cooperation with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU), and has obtained approval from the Hong Kong government for the blockchain project, titled “Blockchain-Based Food and Drug Counterfeit Detection and Regulatory System”, coded as “UIM/331”. Information related to this project is publicly available on Hong Kong Special Administration Region (“HKSAR”)’s official website at http://itf.gov.hk/l-eng/Prj-eng/Prj_Search_Index.asp. At the same time, UBI cooperates with blockchain experts and technical teams from Germany, India and other countries and regions, committed to the development of blockchain and its application in health industry.

On August 15-16, 2018, UBI together with other founders and sponsors, organized a Global Blockchain Cooperation Alliance Forum at the Company’s Hong Kong Cyberport headquarters. More than 200 people who are blockchain experts, scholars, lawyers, financiers and entrepreneurs, from universities, research institutes, and media from over 20 countries and regions attended the event. UBI introduced and demonstrated the results of its blockchain development and application at the conference, and proposed the concept “2018, the genesis of applied blockchain technology.”
 
UBI is optimistic about blockchain technology because blockchain is an innovative form of combination of computer skills such as distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consistent mechanisms, and encryption algorithms. Owing to its unique characteristics such as being traceable and modification resistant, decentralized and open transparent. Blockchain technology can be used to effectively address the safety and quality issues of products and services in the health industry. Monitored by the technology, the factitious factors are eliminated. The integration of Internet of Things “IoT”, Virtual Reality “VR”, Augmented Reality “AR”, Artificial Intelligence “AI”, and other technologies will greatly improve the application level and effectiveness.
 
The UBI blockchain system is based on the Ethereum framework and adopts the consortium blockchain (as defined below). This is the first generation and the first product of UBI as well. In early September 2018, the product was introduced to the market for promotion. UBI defines the consortium blockchain as follows: 1. Important product quality data must be stored in the blockchain to ensure its traceability and resistance to modification; 2. Only authorized organizations or individual are allowed to enter product data in the blockchain (characteristics of private chain); 3. Block Data in the blockchain is completely open and accessible to the public (characteristics of public chain). 4. Smart contracts are widely used in application scenarios.
 
UBI has developed a plan dedicated to the long-term development and application of blockchain technology to the Chinese health care industry. The Company’s goal is to reshape the trust system and innovate the business model for the Chinese health care industry by building the UBI blockchain based Global Health Chain system. This goal has three important parts: the first one is Kang-Chain Network, which will be an internet-based blockchain network capable of worldwide coverage, which we believe will enable connections through the internet between natural persons, medical institutions, and providers of health products and health services. We may also describe it as a value oriented or trust internet, to differentiate it from the current information internet. A trust system, service concept, and value orientation can be built for the safeguard of human lives and health quality from the perspective of super technology and cutting-edge thinking. We believe this future model for health differentiates itself from the current health practice in that it is built on trust and safeguard to provide a professional, targeted, flexible, easy to use, peer to peer, group to group, and safe health world that is writable and readable. We believe that the Kang-Chain Network will connect everyone, regardless the location in the world, to have all one’s needs of health satisfied. We believe that the Kang-Chain Network has the potential to entirely change the health world as it is known to us today. The second part consists of the Kang-Kang-Chain Cloud, which will fundamentally change people’s fear for and concerns about “clouds”. What is more important is that it will protect data privacy with clustered blockchain technology, so as to truly realize the data safety, privacy, permit based share, value, and socialization. Disconnected, and fragmented health data can be active and integrated with a humane premise, hence making it possible a human shared wealth to serve the human health. Kang Chain Cloud establishes a convenient cloud storage, a private safe, and information exchange of health data and information for individuals. The third part is Kang-Chain Community. Exchange and transactions between people used to be simple. However, along with the emergence of residual value, the trust between people started to disappear. People have worked hard to find a mechanism to get the lost trust back. People did not realize that the mechanism they were looking for had deviated from their original intention until today. Peer to peer is forthright and simple. This is exactly one of the essential characteristics of the blockchain technology, and the one that makes the disruption of reality and return to the nature possible. UBI believes the peer to peer business model will replace the current ones, and will work as a catalyst for the new communities and new business models. This also reflects the social progress and development, as well as the new normal of the shared demand, shared value, shared interest, and mutual reliance. The satisfaction between supply and demand featuring the exchange of peer to peer, group to group, and zero distance will naturally make the cost of exchange down to zero, value and speed maximized, and trusted. The innovative Kang Chain Community will be the highlight of the UBI global public health chain. Kang Chain Community is a commercial community formed out of an innovative model based on Kang Chain Network, and Kang Chain Cloud. This is a voluntary consumer community of the new era built on mutual understanding and trusting with their common needs and shared values.

Industry Trends
 
Blockchain techniques have shown considerable adaptability in recent years, as various market sectors have sought to find ways of incorporating capabilities into their operations. Especially since 2014, the blockchain began to be applied in the industry and commerce, and the blockchain application has entered a new era in 2018. Previously, the blockchain was mainly applied in the cryptocurrency, which kind of replaced the blockchain to mainly serve the financial industry. However, as the governments of various countries strengthen the supervision of virtual currency, the cryptocurrency circle will be restricted, and the blockchain will play an increasingly important role in industrial applications. Blockchain technology will be widely applied in the future in the fields of finance, medical health, games, copyright, sharing economy, social contact, cloud computing and other fields or industries. It will subvert today’s thinking and social models in many ways.
 
Application based on blockchain technology
 
Our management plans to focus its blockchain business on the health industry in China, and give priority to food and pharmaceuticals safety by providing effective technical systems, to prevent counterfeit foods and pharmaceuticals. With the development of blockchain technology, we can trace the entire process of food or pharmaceuticals in an all-round way in the integration of technology clusters such as IoT, VR, AR, AI, and robotics to provide manufacturers and consumers with the maximum symmetrical information exchange throughout the whole manufacturing and logistics process.
 
We are now in the early stages of blockchain technology, but we believe we have a good understanding of the framework design, the transition between the health industry language and the IT language, and the combination between the blockchain & the IoT and food & pharmaceutical technologies. We believe we are in a leading position and destined to have a bright future of blockchain technology.
 
Healthcare market
 
Our management believes that with the improvement of people’s living standards and the growing health awareness, the era of comprehensive health care has arrived. Following the article “Health China 2030” published by China government, we came to further understanding that healthcare, genetic testing, cell storage, precise health management, personal health data storage and analysis are increasingly recognized by humans and will become rigid demands. Traditional health care methods are being subverted. In 2015, “Health in China” was upgraded to China’s national strategy; in 2016, China launched the “Precision Medical Plan” with genetic testing technology as the main means; in 2016,“Health in China Outline 2030” plans to invest 60 billion yuan; in “The Development Plan for Emerging Industries of 2017”, genetic technology is included in National Document No. 1. In the United States, more than 5 million people receive genetic testing every year, creating a profit of 3 billion US dollars; Japan proposed the National Health Plan as early as in 1988 and nowadays the Japanese’s average life expectancy has reached 84 years old. Everybody needs health management. It is estimated that the market scale of China’s health industry will exceed 10 trillion yuan by 2020, according to China National Statistics Bureau.
 
Opportunities
 
Blockchain and the IoT are technologies that affect the future and are important ways and means to ensure the safety of health products and health services in the health market. UBI is the first company to enter this market. Being the first one of applying blockchain technology in the health industry will help the company position and develop itself in this field. The access in this market is of high criteria and cost. The ideas and beliefs of the UBI team make us optimistic about the future.
 
In conclusion, we believe that the global health market has the potential to be huge, not only because it has tremendous market dividends formed by resources that people continuously invest, but also because this market is related to human life and wellness, directly affecting the quality of human life and happiness. Therefore, we will seize the emerging technology of blockchain and the market opportunities at this particular stage, from the perspective of interests as well as the responsibility for human life and wellness, striving for the safety of food and pharmaceuticals and the safety of health services.
 
Our Strategy
 
UBI will firmly and persistently dedicate itself in research, development, application and promotion of the blockchain technology to the health industry in China. We believe that this disruptive technology will profoundly affect the next ten years or even longer and will, in our opinion, benefit all humanity in the health industry. Our mission is to reshape the trust system and innovate the business model with blockchain technology. We will promote the wide application of blockchain technology in the entity industry and commerce, to explore further of the blockchain beyond its characteristics of value transfer.
 
Our growth strategy depends to a large extent on our ability to bring the products and technical service to potential customers in target markets. We plan to initially target the China market and gradually expand to Europe, the United States and the other countries and regions.

Competitive Advantages
 
1. Excellent technical team
 
In its early stage of development, UBI has been cooperating with Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU) and received support from the HKSAR. In this context, a joint effort in research and development participated by enterprises, universities and governments was formed with a competitive advantage. At the same time, we work closely with international blockchain experts and technical teams. We have brought together the advantages of technology and talent.
 
2. Innovate blockchain application system and products through independent design and development.
 
The initial design of our blockchain system has firmly grasped the food and drug safety issue, an industry pain point that are widely concerned. The technicians and enterprise personnel cooperated to make analysis and design, optimize various frameworks and solutions from the perspective of the industry chain and supply chain, and has created a unique blockchain traceability system for safety purpose — consortium blockchain product. Meanwhile, we are deploying the UBI global health chain global system based on UBI blockchain technology world widely, in order to create Kang-Chain product group.
 
3. We have reliable resources in China’s health industry.
 
In China, UBI’s management has rich experience and resources in the health industry, which can be used for scientific research and development, raw material production bases and other industrial chains. The company’s management is also familiar with the international pharmaceutical market and the food market.
 
4. A good management team.
 
Our management, technical team and consulting team are the leading talents and professionals in their fields. They pursue high quality work. They are smart, responsible, charitable and gifted with vision and innovation spirit.
 
Target Market
 
Our current target market is China, where we believe food and pharmaceuticals safety has become a major challenge. Counterfeit food and pharmaceuticals are very common in China, due to natural and man-made factors. Although the safety of food and pharmaceuticals is closely linked to the vital wellness of hundreds of millions of people, we believe that the laws and regulations governing food and pharmaceutical safety in China are not perfect or complete and may not be strictly enforced in many occasions. The occurrence of poison capsule events, vaccine incident, ginkgo leaf, licorice tablets and other major drug dealing and counterfeiting cases, have had serious affects on people’s physical and mental health.
 
Sources of Income and Pricing
 
UBI plans to develop a series of blockchain technology based products, such as private blockchain, consortium blockchain and public blockchain which are developed based on different application scenarios and market demands, and as well as the technical system platform. The company generates revenue and profits by providing services and effective products to potential target customers. The price will be determined by the market supply and demand. After initial promotion and marketing, the company’s products and services may have an impact on the existing healthcare industry. Looking ahead, emerging technologies will lead new trends in the health care industry, law enforcement, privacy protection, food and pharmaceuticals safety. UBI will produce good profit by providing specific blockchain solutions and systematic services.

Sales and Marketing
 
In the future, we will mainly market UBI blockchain system and products through online and offline store. Marketing will also be promoted through cross-border e-commerce platforms. Conference marketing and professional channel marketing will be utilized. Our products and designs also consider the overall needs of human beings and will be tailor-made for some clients. Currently, we are paying attention to the development, formation and demands of China’s “One Belt, One Road” infrastructure initiative.
 
UBI management believe that UBI’s Global Health Public Blockchain will be our flagship product. On this public blockchain, we not only provide services for health institutions, enterprises, hospitals, etc., but more importantly, our health public blockchain network will connect various communities. In this case, peer-to-peer non-centralized marketing will be realized, which will make marketing faster and lower in cost. Meanwhile, enterprises and consumers can establish a common value on consuming. It will also enable individuals in the community to establish their own health data leger on the public chain, so they can effectively and safely manage their own health data, and become the true manager of their own health. Health data can be used for individuals to improve their own health, and can also be managed to create economic and social benefits through data analysis and appropriate use based on consented and shared value built among community members.
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company does not now engage in any manufacturing but may engage in manufacturing of products to be sold on the Company’s website in the future.
Government Regulation
 
We are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the State of Delaware, where we are incorporated, the United States and the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, data security, data retention, consumer protection, advertising, electronic commerce, intellectual property, manufacturing, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws.
 
In particular, there are numerous U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other user data, the scope of which is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations, and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy, data security, and data protection. However, given that the scope, interpretation, and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be conflicting, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with our privacy or security policies or privacy-related legal obligations by us or third-party service-providers or the failure or perceived failure by third-party apps, with which our users choose to share their data, to comply with their privacy policies or privacy-related legal obligations as they relate to the data shared with them, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or negative publicity, and could have an adverse effect on our brand and operating results.
 
We plan to develop solutions to ensure that data transfers from the E.U. provide adequate protections to comply with the E.U. Data Protection Directive. If we fail to develop such alternative data transfer solutions, one or more national data protection authorities in the European Union could bring enforcement actions seeking to prohibit or suspend our data transfers to the U.S. and we could also face additional legal liability, fines, negative publicity, and resulting loss of business.
 
Governments are continuing to focus on privacy and data security and it is possible that new privacy or data security laws will be passed or existing laws will be amended in a way that is material to our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices regarding our users’ data could require us to modify our services and features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services, and features. Although we have made efforts to design our policies, procedures, and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal, and foreign laws, changes to applicable laws and regulations in this area could subject us to additional regulation and oversight, any of which could significantly increase our operating costs.

The labeling, distribution, importation, marketing, and sale of our intended products are subject to extensive regulation by various U.S. state and federal and foreign agencies, including the CPSC, Federal Trade Commission, Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, Federal Communications Commission, and state attorneys general, as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local, and international regulatory authorities in the countries in which our intended products and services are distributed or sold. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could become subject to enforcement actions or the imposition of significant monetary fines, other penalties, or claims, which could harm our operating results or our ability to conduct our business.
 
The global nature of our business operations also create various domestic and foreign regulatory challenges and subject us to laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions, and our intended products are also subject to U.S. export controls, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. If we become liable under these laws or regulations, we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain products or services, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, and legislative proposals could harm our brand or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of compliance or other liabilities under these laws or regulations could harm our business and operating results.
 
PRC Government Regulations
 
Because our business and employees are located in the PRC, our business is also regulated by the national and local laws of the PRC. We believe our conduct of business complies with existing PRC laws, rules and regulations.
General Regulation of Businesses
 
We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable labor and safety laws and regulations in the PRC, including the PRC Labor Contract Law, the PRC Production Safety Law, the PRC Regulation for Insurance for Labor Injury, the PRC Unemployment Insurance Law, the PRC Provisional Insurance Measures for Maternity of Employees, PRC Interim Provisions on Registration of Social Insurance, PRC Interim Regulation on the Collection and Payment of Social Insurance Premiums and other related regulations, rules and provisions issued by the relevant governmental authorities from time to time.
 
According to the PRC Labor Contract Law, we are required to enter into labor contracts with our employees. We are required to pay no less than local minimum wages to our employees. We are also required to provide employees with labor safety and sanitation conditions meeting PRC government laws and regulations and carry out regular health examinations of our employees engaged in hazardous occupations. Violations of the PRC Labor Contract Law and the PRC Labor Law may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative and criminal liability in the case of serious violations. In addition, according to the PRC Social Insurance Law, employers like our PRC subsidiaries in China must provide employees with welfare schemes covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance, and housing funds.
 
Foreign Currency Exchange
 
The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in China is the Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended (2008). Under these Rules, RMB is freely convertible for current account items, such as trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan or investment in securities outside China unless the prior approval of, and/or registration with, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the People’s Republic of China, or SAFE, or its local counterparts (as the case may be) is obtained.
 
Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, in China may purchase foreign currency without the approval of SAFE for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. They may also retain foreign exchange (subject to a cap approved by SAFE) to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. In addition, if a foreign company acquires a subsidiary in China, the acquired company will also become an FIE. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of FIEs to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In addition, foreign exchange transactions for direct investment, loan and investment in securities outside China are still subject to limitations and require approvals from, and/or registration with, SAFE.
