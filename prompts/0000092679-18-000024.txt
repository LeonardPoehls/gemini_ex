ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Sparton Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company” or “Sparton”) has been in continuous existence since 1900. It was last reorganized in 1919 as an Ohio corporation. The Company is a provider of design, development and manufacturing services for complex electromechanical devices, as well as sophisticated engineered products complementary to the same electromechanical value stream. The Company serves the Medical & Biotechnology, Military & Aerospace and Industrial & Commercial markets through two reportable business segments; Manufacturing & Design Services (“MDS”) and Engineered Components & Products (“ECP”). All of the Company's facilities are certified to one or more of the ISO/AS standards, including ISO 9001, AS9100 and ISO 13485, with most having additional certifications based on the needs of the customers they serve. The majority of the Company's customers are in highly regulated industries where strict adherence to regulations such as the International Tariff and Arms Regulations ("ITAR") is necessary. The Company's products and services include offerings for Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) and Emerging Technology (“ET”) customers that utilize microprocessor-based systems which include transducers, printed circuit boards and assemblies, sensors and electromechanical components, as well as development and design engineering services relating to these product sales. Sparton also develops and manufactures sonobuoys, anti-submarine warfare (“ASW”) devices used by the United States Navy as well as by foreign governments that meet Department of State licensing requirements. Additionally, Sparton manufactures rugged flat panel display systems for military panel PC workstations, air traffic control and industrial applications, as well as high performance industrial grade computer systems and peripherals. Many of the physical and technical attributes in the production of these proprietary products are similar to those required in the production of the Company's other electrical and electromechanical products and assemblies.
On July 7, 2017, Sparton Corporation (the "Company" or "Sparton"), Ultra Electronics Holdings plc, (“Ultra”), and Ultra Electronics Aneira Inc., (“Merger Sub”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") that provided for Ultra to acquire the Company by merging Merger Sub into the Company (such transaction referred to as the "Merger"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
On October 5, 2017, at a special meeting of holders of shares of common stock of the Company, shareholders voted to adopt the Merger Agreement. Although the Merger Agreement had been adopted by the Company's shareholders, consummation of the Merger remained subject to other closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the “HSR Act”).
On March 5, 2018, Sparton announced the termination by Sparton and Ultra of the Merger Agreement as a result of the staff of the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) informing the parties that it intended to recommend that the DOJ block the Merger. Under a Merger Termination Agreement entered into by Sparton, Ultra and Merger Sub, the parties agreed to release each other from certain claims and liabilities arising out of or related to the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated therein or thereby, including any termination fees. The parties also agreed that certain agreements with confidentiality obligations will continue in full force and effect.
Also on March 5, 2018, Sparton announced that, during the DOJ’s review of Sparton’s proposed Merger with Ultra, the United States Navy (the “Navy”) expressed the view that instead of the parties proceeding with the Merger, each of Sparton and Ultra should enhance its ability to independently develop, produce and sell sonobuoys and over time work toward the elimination of their use of Sparton’s and Ultra’s joint venture for such activities. Since that time, Sparton has been in communication with the Navy to better understand its expectations with respect to the timing, funding and terms of current and future sonobuoy indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity ("IDIQ") production contracts. While no deadlines have been established nor funding decisions agreed upon, we believe the Navy would find it desirable if Sparton and Ultra were in a position to eliminate the use of the ERAPSCO joint venture for the sale of sonobuoys to the Navy by September 2024, which is the end of the GFY19-GFY23 IDIQ contract. Due to the significance of the effort and expenditures required, there can be no assurance that Sparton, or both of the ERAPSCO joint venture partners, will be able to independently develop, produce and sell fully qualified sonobuoys by that time, or at an earlier date if so required by the Navy. The GFY19-GFY23 IDIQ contract is currently under evaluation, and we anticipate that an award will be made by the Navy in GFY19 and that final delivery will be scheduled to occur in 2024. Additionally, we understand that there will be no impact on the existing GFY14-GFY18 IDIQ contract which provides for final delivery to occur in 2019.
On July 9, 2018, the Company announced the filing of a bid protest by ERAPSCO with the United States Government Accountability Office ("GAO") challenging the competitive range exclusion of ERAPSCO under the United States Navy ("Navy") Solicitation No. N00019-19-R-0002 for the GFY 19-23 AN/SSQ-125A (the "Q-125A") production sonobuoy. The protest challenged on a number of bases the Navy's decision to exclude ERAPSCO from the solicitation process and requested that GAO restore ERAPSCO's ability to participate in the process. On August 30, 2018, the Navy issued a notice that it had 
4

taken corrective action to reopen the competitive range regarding the Q-125A production sonobuoy and include ERAPSCO in that competitive range. This allows ERAPSCO to again participate in the bid process. As a result of the Navy’s decision to restore ERAPSCO’s ability to participate in the bid process, on September 4, 2018 the GAO dismissed the protest. 
As a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company announced that it would seek to re-engage with parties that previously expressed an interest in acquiring all or a part of Sparton and that are in a position to expeditiously proceed to effect such a transaction. There can be no assurance that any such process will result in the execution of a definitive agreement or the completion of a transaction.

MDS Segment
MDS segment operations are comprised of contract design, manufacturing and aftermarket repair and refurbishment of sophisticated printed circuit card assemblies, sub-assemblies, full product assemblies and cable/wire harnesses for customers seeking to bring their intellectual property to market. Additionally, Sparton is a developer of embedded software and software quality assurance services in connection with medical devices and diagnostic equipment. Customers include OEM and ET customers serving the Medical & Biotechnology, Military & Aerospace and Industrial & Commercial markets. In engineering and manufacturing for its customers, this segment adheres to very strict military and aerospace specifications and Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) guidelines and approvals, in addition to product and process certifications. 
The segment strives to exceed customers’ expectations with high delivery and quality performance. Our market advantage is our enterprise-wide Sparton Business System, experience and knowledge of the market, breadth of services that we offer and the relationships that we have developed over the past several decades. The competition includes both foreign and domestic companies, in addition to the internal capabilities of some of our customers. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing or marketing resources than we do. Sparton's MDS segment excels in providing low-volume, high-mix services to highly-regulated end markets. OEM's in our market segments are continually driving costs out of their respective businesses through outsourcing strategies, allowing opportunity for Sparton to capture additional value add opportunities.
The engineering and manufacturing of highly complex devices is a fairly fragmented industry with no dominant player in the market. In the past, large printed circuit board contract manufacturers have sold their “box build” capabilities and have been very successful. The industry has continued to grow with more companies developing printed circuit board assembly (“PCBA”) capabilities and others entering the market via mergers and acquisitions of smaller companies. This has led to stronger competition with larger companies that have the financial resources to offer the services that the customers are requiring. Customers will assume that quality will be 100% and will drive their decisions based on services offered that best fit their total solutions needs as well as on the overall cost of the these services.
The understanding of the market needs is critical for our success. We are well positioned with our capabilities to meet our current organic growth plans. Historically, acquisitions have been an important element of the growth strategy for the MDS segment. The segment recently had supplemented its organic growth by identifying, acquiring and integrating acquisition opportunities that resulted in broader, more sophisticated product and service offerings while diversifying and expanding the Company's customer base and markets. Today, the Company's focus is on organic growth.
The Company does not believe that the MDS segment is substantially dependent on any individual contract or agreement with any customer and the significance of these large customers continues to be reduced through the Company's customer diversification as a result of growth. The Company's typical contractual arrangement with a customer is represented by a master agreement which includes certain master terms and conditions of Sparton's relationship with this customer. This agreement does not commit the customer to any specific volume of purchases. Moreover, these terms can be amended in appropriate circumstances. Thus, until this customer submits a purchase order to Sparton, there is no guarantee of any revenue to Sparton. The Company uses the purchase orders to determine volume and delivery requirements.
The majority of Sparton's MDS segment customers are in highly regulated industries where strict adherence to regulations such as ITAR, regulations issued by the FDA, the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and similar foreign jurisdiction regulations such as the European Union RoHS (Restriction of 
5

Hazardous Substances) and REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) is necessary. Non-compliance risks range from variance notifications to production/shipping prevention depending upon the agency and form of non-compliance. These requirements are highly technical in nature and require strict adherence and documentation related to operational processes. Sparton's quality system provides us the ability to service such markets, differentiating Sparton from some potential competitors which lack such systems.
ECP Segment
ECP segment operations are comprised of design, development and production of proprietary products for both domestic and foreign defense markets, as well as for commercial needs. ECP designs and manufactures ASW devices known as sonobuoys for the U.S. Navy and for foreign governments that meet Department of State licensing requirements. This segment also performs an engineering development function for the United States military and prime defense contractors for advanced technologies, primarily in the Undersea Warfare space, ultimately leading to future defense products, as well as replacements for existing products. Specifically, the sonobuoy product line is built to stringent military specifications. These products are restricted by International Tariff and Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and qualified by the U.S. Navy, which limits opportunities for competition. This segment is also a provider of rugged flat panel display systems for military panel PC workstations, air traffic control and industrial and commercial marine applications, as well as high performance industrial grade computer systems and peripherals. Rugged displays are manufactured for prime contractors, in some cases to specific military grade specifications. Additionally, this segment internally develops and markets commercial products for underwater acoustics and microelectromechanical (“MEMS”) based inertial measurement.
Sparton is a 50/50 joint venture (“JV”) partner with UnderSea Sensor Systems, Inc. (“USSI”), currently the only other major producer of U.S. derivative sonobuoys. USSI's parent company is Ultra Electronics Holdings plc, based in the United Kingdom. The JV operates under the name ERAPSCO and allows Sparton and USSI to combine their own unique and complementary backgrounds to jointly develop and produce U.S. derivative sonobuoy designs for the U.S. Navy as well as for foreign governments that meet Department of State licensing requirements. ERAPSCO maintains the DBA Sonobuoy TechSystems through which it conducts business directly with foreign governments. In concept, and in practice, ERAPSCO serves as a pass-through entity maintaining no funds or assets. While the JV provides the opportunity to maximize efficiencies in the design and development of the related sonobuoys, both of the joint venture partners function independently as subcontractors; therefore, there is no separate entity to be accounted for or consolidated. The Board of Directors of ERAPSCO has the responsibility for the overall management and operation of the JV. The six member board consists of equal representation (full time employees) from both JV partners for three year terms. Personnel necessary for the operation of ERAPSCO, specifically a president, vice president, general manager, contract administrator and financial manager, are similarly assigned by the JV partners for rotating three year terms and the costs of these assigned individuals are borne by the party assigning the personnel. In response to a customer request for proposal (“RFP”) that ERAPSCO will bid on, the Board of Directors of ERAPSCO approves both the composition of a response to the RFP and the composite bid to be submitted to the customer based on financial thresholds set forth in the JV agreement. The Board of Directors of ERAPSCO strives to divide the aggregate contract awards at a 50/50 share ratio. Each JV partner bears the costs it incurs associated with the preparation and submission of proposals. Each JV partner submits to ERAPSCO a proposal for the estimated price of performing that portion of the RFP applicable to it. Upon award of a contract to the JV, separate subcontracts are generated between ERAPSCO and each of the JV partners defining the responsibilities and compensation. These subcontracts contain terms and conditions consistent with the prime contract. Each JV partner is responsible to ERAPSCO for the successful execution of its respective scope of work under its subcontract and each JV partner is individually accountable for the profit or losses sustained in the execution of the subcontract against its respective bid. In some instances, either Sparton or USSI handles the complete production and delivery of sonobuoys to ERAPSCO's customer. In other instances, either Sparton or USSI starts the production and ship completed subassemblies to the other party for additional processing before being delivered to the customers. Under ERAPSCO, individual contract risk exposures are reduced, while the likelihood of achieving U.S. Navy and other ASW objectives is enhanced. ERAPSCO has been in existence since 1987 and historically, the agreed upon products included under the JV were generally developmental sonobuoys. In 2007, the JV expanded to include all future sonobuoy development and substantially all U.S. derivative sonobuoy products for customers outside of the United States. The JV was further expanded three years later to include all sonobuoy products for the U.S. Navy beginning with U.S. Navy's 2010 fiscal year contracts.
New internally funded products are under development for sale as commercial products to the navigation, heading and positioning systems applications markets. Markets for these products include autonomous underwater and ground vehicles, handheld laser range finders, as well as unattended aerial vehicles as our product offerings grow. The principal example of such products is a family of precision inertial sensors for applications such as navigation or undersea petroleum exploration. Competition among companies that build these products is intense and dynamic. As such, development of our commercial products requires the identification of sustainable competitive advantages (“SCA”) prior to investment to ensure there is a viable market for our products. Each new product must advance the technology available to the market enough to overcome the inherent inertia preventing potential customers from switching from competitor's products. Likewise, existing products are 
6

evaluated periodically to ensure their SCA is still maintained and if not, either redesign or end-of-life occurs. The expansion of our commercial product lines leverages the intrinsic engineering talent at Sparton and capitalizes on the sonobuoy product volumes to provide technological as well as economies of scale advantages. Pursuit of commercial markets and all sales and profits from this endeavor are not a part of the ERAPSCO JV.
During fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, Sparton incurred internally funded research and development (“IR&D”) expenses of $2.7 million, $1.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, for the internal development of technologies. Customer funded R&D costs, which are usually part of a larger production agreement, totaled $3.8 million, $5.6 million and $16.7 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Sonobuoy and related engineering services, including sales to the U.S. Navy and foreign governments, accounted for 32%, 29% and 28% of consolidated revenue for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Sales to the U.S Navy accounted for 25%, 23% and 22% of consolidated revenue for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The U.S. Navy issues multiple contracts annually for its sonobuoy and engineering requirements. The loss of U.S. Navy sonobuoy sales would have a material adverse financial effect on the Company. While the overall relationship with the U.S. Navy is important to Sparton, the Company does not believe that it is substantially dependent on any individual contract or agreement with the U.S. Navy, other than the Subcontract, effective October 26, 2017 between Sparton DeLeon Springs, LLC and ERAPSCO; the Subcontract, effective December 20, 2017, between Sparton DeLeon Springs, LLC and ERAPSCO; the Subcontract, effective March 15, 2018, between Sparton DeLeon Springs, LLC and ERAPSCO and the Subcontract, effective April 11, 2018, between Sparton DeLeon Springs, LLC and ERAPSCO (collectively, the “Material Subcontracts”). Each of the Material Subcontracts is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and each has been issued pursuant to a U.S. Navy one year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with four option years (the “IDIQ Contract”). The IDIQ Contract is also considered a material contract to the Company and is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Pursuant to the currently effective subcontracts issued pursuant to the IDIQ, including certain of the Material Subcontracts, Sparton will supply sonobuoys to the U.S. Navy through ERAPSCO based on total subcontract awards received by Sparton DeLeon Springs, LLC in fiscal year 2018 of approximately $83.9 million.
United States Navy contracts allow Sparton to submit performance based billings, which are then applied against inventories purchased and manufacturing costs incurred by the Company throughout its performance under these contracts. Inventories were reduced by performance based payments from the U.S. Navy for costs incurred related to long-term contracts, thereby establishing inventory to which the U.S. Navy then has title, of $8.6 million and $8.5 million, respectively, at July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017. At July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017, current liabilities include performance based payments of $3.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively, on Navy contracts. As these payments are in excess of cost, there is no inventory to which the government would claim title and, therefore, no offset to inventory has been made.
ECP business operations are affected by numerous laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Navy contracts. The U.S. Navy generally has the ability to terminate ECP contracts, in whole or in part, without prior notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. If any of these contracts were terminated for convenience, Sparton would generally be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs, but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed.
Non-sonobuoy related manufacturing and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force. In addition, our divisional and executive management teams are an integral part of our sales and marketing teams.
Other
Materials used in our operations are generally available from a variety of worldwide sources, with the exception of certain select components. Our ability to access competitively priced materials is critical to our business success. Additionally, the volume purchasing power of larger competitors creates an advantage for them. During the past year, the Company has encountered higher than normal electronic component shortages and extended lead time issues due to shortages of certain components in the marketplace. These shortages and extended lead times are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. This condition has resulted in higher prices for these components as we seek to secure the necessary components from our suppliers or alternative suppliers, extension of our product delivery dates, and increased inventory levels due to a need to purchase components earlier than normally required. In addition to these shortages, recent developments in global trade relations have resulted in tariffs on components and raw materials we utilize. Uncertainties exist regarding the duration of these tariffs, the potential for an escalation of global trading issues, and our ability to recover these tariffs through price increases or other means. The risk of material obsolescence in our businesses is less significant than that which exists in many other markets since raw materials and component parts are generally purchased only upon receipt of a customer's order. However, excess material resulting from increasing order lead-times may pose a risk due to potential order cancellation or customer-directed design changes. While the Company does not expect to encounter significant long-term raw material procurement issues, raw material supply issues and global trade uncertainties pose a risk to our profitability.
