ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
 
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2013, under the name of All Soft Gels, Inc.
 
All Soft Gels, Inc. (“We”, or the “Company”) will market the sale of one soft gel liquid capsule (named All Soft Gels Kre-Alkalyn Liquid Gels).
 
GENERAL INTRODUCTION


All Soft Gels, Inc. has not commenced its major operations of having its one product a soft-gel capsule named All Soft Gels Kre-Alkalyn Liquid Gels, manufactured by an unaffiliated outside provider (Soft Gel Technologies, Inc. (SGTI) and the Company has not distributed the product to anyone. We are presently marketing All Soft Gels Kre-Alkalyn Liquid Gels in the Salt Lake City, Utah area.  We will not have any All Soft Gels Kre-Alkalyn Liquid Gels manufactured until the Company has sold the product to an end user.  We have not commenced our major operations.
 
In addition, the Company has not achieved any revenue in connection with its business for the year ended December 31, 2016.   As a result , we are a startup company, that is, we have no operating history or revenue, and are at a competitive disadvantage.

 The product is a liquid gel capsule containing soybean oil, kre-alkalyn creatine, gelatin, glycerin, L-glutamic acid, yellow beeswax, purified water, L-leucine, L-Arginine, and lecithin.  The product is to be taken orally, preferably with water.  Upon digestion the product is absorbed to provide increased blood flow for enhanced workout ability leading to improved strength and muscle gain. One serving is two capsules per day. The product is to be used as part of a fitness and training program, and maximum benefit will occur when used in conjunction with a weight training regimen. Intended customers are adults (persons over 18 years of age) involved in fitness or weight training.
 
As a dietary supplement, there are no FDA requirements on this product. All Soft Gels, Inc. has not sent the product to the FDA for approval because it is not required, and because it would be a lengthy and costly process to have this product FDA approved when not required.
 
The soft gel liquid capsules are manufactured by Soft Gels Technologies, Inc. (SGTI), who adheres to very strict guidelines they are placed under by all agencies with whom they work. SGTI has verbally indicated that all their ingredients used in any consumable products are very closely monitored.   Their business is registered as a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) company with NSF’s Dietary Supplement Certification program and the Natural Products Association (NPA), a status they have held for many years. They also have gone the extra step and are certified through NSF’s Athletic Banned Substances program, also known as GMP for Sport™, which means that their products will not contain any ingredients that might be of concern to professional athletes with regard to drug testing. The NSA and NPA are non-governmental third parties.   SGTI’s GMP for Sport™ certification only applies to its products and not the product it will manufacture for All Soft Gels, Inc.  However, in keeping with SGTI standards, the soft gel capsule SGTI will manufacture for All Soft Gels, Inc. does not and will not contain ingredients on any banned substance list.
 
Development of the capsules is complete, although manufacturing of the capsules will be ongoing as supply and demand dictates.
 
All Soft Gels, Inc. has nothing proprietary about their product. At this time, All Soft Gels, Inc. has no intellectual property in connection with the capsules.  However, we believe our product is superior that of the competition due to the Kre-Alkalyn creatine being in a soft gel form, avoiding substantial product break down before digestion as happens with competitors’ products.


The competition for and difficulty in selling energy Gel Caps may affect our ability to develop profitable operations in the future.  Companies that are engaged in energy Gel Caps retail products include large, established companies with substantial capabilities and long earnings records.
 
 Initial Sales Strategy
 We have established a two-prong sales approach; our approach utilizes direct sales through Mr. Nelson. Our direct sales will be conducted by Mr. Nelson. He will market the product locally in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. The Company’s current marketing strategy consists of various Point of Sale materials to include material to include advertising posters, flyers and magnetic strips with the Company name and its product developed by Mr. Nelson in the past several months. We also intend to derive sales from our internet website which is currently under development at:  http://www.allsoftgels.com.  We need further funding to complete the Company’s internet website. In addition, sales will be done by word of mouth, referrals, and online marketing.

Subsequent Sales Strategy
  All Soft Gels, Inc. will commence the marketing of the liquid gels for sale to the general public and is presently developing its marketing program for the sale of the liquid gels to the general public.  The Company is not offering the product to anyone at this time.  All Soft Gels, Inc. is considered a development stage company because it has not commenced its major operations. In addition, the Company has not achieved any revenue in connection with its business as of December 31, 2016. As a result, we are a startup company, which means that the Company has no operating history or revenue, and therefore is at a competitive disadvantage.
 
 We have no operating history and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Should we continue to incur losses for a significant amount of time, the value of your investment in the common shares could be affected downward, and you could even lose your entire investment.
 
We have not yet received any revenues from our development stage operations, nor have we otherwise engaged in any business operations. All Soft Gels, Inc. is a development stage company and in the absence of revenues and operations the Independent Audit Report dated March 6,  2016, cites a going concern. The going concern statement opinion issued by the independent auditors is the result of a lack of operations and working capital.
 
The company will need to raise capital which concerned the independent auditors because there is insufficient cash for operations for the next twelve months.  We will have to seek other sources of capital.

 
We established the minimum amount of $75,000 that the company will need to raise through debt instruments such as bank loans, or private financing so that operations could start, in order to generate some type of revenue. Presently no other sources have been identified and it is unknown if any other sources will be identified. There is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any bank loans or private financing. Additionally, we have no business plan to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person.
