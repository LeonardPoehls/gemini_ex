Item 1. Business.
Mission and Vision 
 Instructure’s mission is to make software that makes people smarter. Our vision is to help organizations everywhere leverage technology to maximize the potential of their people. 
Overview 
 We provide an innovative, cloud-based learning management platform for academic institutions and companies worldwide. We built our learning management applications, Canvas, for the education market, and Bridge, for the corporate market, to enable our customers to easily develop, deliver and manage engaging face-to-face and online learning experiences. Our platform combines powerful, elegant and easy-to-use functionality with the reliability, security, scalability and support required by our customers. 
 In today’s dynamic, knowledge-driven economy, quality education and constant learning are critical to compete and succeed. Academic institutions recognize that for students to reach their maximum potential, they require a learning environment that is interactive and accessible. Similarly, companies need to deliver seamless and easy learning experiences to better attract, develop and retain talent and compete more effectively. 
  We develop software that millions of students, teachers and employees use to help achieve their education and learning goals. Our applications enhance academic and corporate learning by providing an engaging, easy-to-use platform for instructors and learners, enabling frequent and open interactions, streamlining workflow, and allowing the creation and sharing of content with anytime, anywhere access to information. Our platform runs on a modern, cloud-based architecture that enables users to teach, learn and engage across a wide variety of application environments, operating systems, devices and locations at any time. Our open standards allow for integration with third-party publishers and software providers to deliver additional learning content and applications. Our platform also provides data analytics capabilities enabling real-time reaction to information and benchmarking in order to personalize curricula and increase the efficacy of the learning process. 
 We offer our platform through a Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, business model. Customers can rapidly deploy our applications with minimal upfront implementation. Customers also benefit from automatic software updates with virtually no downtime. Our SaaS business model substantially reduces the need for our customers to buy and support a broad range of IT infrastructure, and significantly reduces the cost, complexity and disruptions associated with implementations and upgrades of on-premise software. 
 We launched Canvas in February 2011 and have experienced rapid customer adoption in the education market. To better meet the needs of the corporate market, we leveraged a portion of the foundational code underlying Canvas to develop Bridge, which we launched in February 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we had well over 2,000 customers, representing colleges, universities, K-12 school districts, and companies in more than 40 countries.

For 2016, 2015 and 2014, revenue was $110.9 million, $73.2 million, and $44.4 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 51% and 65%. We have experienced net revenue retention rates of over 100% at each of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, our net losses were $53.6 million, $53.0 million and $41.4 million, respectively, as we focused on growing our business. 
 Our Platform 
 We designed our platform to enable users to teach, learn and collaborate anytime, anywhere, across a wide variety of application environments, operating systems, devices and locations. We believe our platform offers the following key benefits: 

• | Intuitive User Experience. Our research-driven approach to design has created elegant and intuitive user interfaces that leverage familiar, consumer web navigation techniques, such as drag and drop, to make it easy to use our platform. We designed our system from the ground up, with modern, web-based design features, to create a differentiated user experience. We enable seamless collaboration among instructors and learners to share feedback and encourage online discussion. These interactive features extend learning beyond the physical classroom and facilitate a more engaging learning experience. For Canvas, users can easily add audio, wikis, online workspaces, social media options and other collaboration tools to their online courses. Furthermore, our video-integrated functionality strengthens instructor-to-student and peer-to-peer online relationships and improves overall retention and usage rates.

• | Optimized for Mobile. Our mobile-optimized platform allows users to access their applications anytime and anywhere. We offer a responsive design to ensure an optimal experience on most devices and, for Canvas, we also have iOS and Android native mobile applications available for free download on both phones and tablets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High Availability and Uptime. Our software is mission-critical for our users and customers and we focus on maintaining enterprise-grade reliability at all times.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High Utilization. Millions of instructors, students, and employees have used our software. According to self-reported data in an ECAR 2015 survey, 44% of faculty in higher education use a learning management system to engage students in activities outside the classroom, while our internal analysis of higher education institutions using Canvas shows that 66% of faculty use Canvas to engage students in activities outside the classroom.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Native Cloud-based Software. Our cloud-based delivery model enables customers to rapidly deploy our applications to experience immediate benefit. Software updates are implemented regularly and transparently. Our single-instance, multi-tenant architecture is designed to scale to support our rapid growth. Our cloud-based platform provides upfront cost savings over on-premise solutions by reducing the need for expensive IT resources and hardware infrastructure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Open Access to Data Analytics. For Canvas, we provide users with open application programming interfaces, or API, access to data analytics. We deliver the analytics in an easy to understand and consumable way, that is optimized for independent analysis. This open visibility allows learners to view their own progress in real-time, educators to adjust programs and personalize curricula for maximum effectiveness and organizations to benchmark user data internally and respond to patterns observed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Open Platform. We are committed to collaboration and openness. Our open standards allow organizations to easily deliver additional learning content and applications from third-party publishers and software providers. This extends the content, tools and services necessary to satisfy the diverse needs of our customers without sacrificing the innate simplicity of our platform. Canvas users can deploy third-party content and software applications within the application interface or browse our EduAppCenter.com’s growing catalog of approximately 250 integrations. Bridge was specifically designed to integrate easily via open APIs with a variety of enterprise resource planning and human resources information systems.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy 
 We are pursuing the following strategies to grow our business: 
  
• | Grow our U.S. Customer Base. We believe that the market for learning management systems remains significantly underserved. K-12 academic institutions have yet to widely adopt learning management systems, while most higher education institutions have adopted legacy systems with which they are often unsatisfied. In the corporate market, there are both greenfield opportunities and opportunities to displace legacy solutions that do not meet customer needs. As a result, we believe there is opportunity to substantially expand our base of U.S. academic and corporate customers. Toward that end, we are making significant investments in growing our direct sales team, particularly focused on the corporate market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Further Maximize our Existing Customer Base. The majority of our academic customers implement Canvas widely within their institutions and across school districts. This approach to wide initial deployments allows us to efficiently and broadly promote adoption and utilization of Canvas by students and faculty. We plan to increase revenue from this customer base by selling additional applications and services. We plan to further penetrate our existing corporate customer base by growing the number of users on our platform and expanding enterprise wide. We believe our user-based pricing model and innovative applications provide us with a substantial opportunity to increase the value of our existing customer base.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to Expand Internationally. We believe there is a significant opportunity for our cloud-based learning management platform outside of the United States and we intend to expand our direct and indirect sales force to further penetrate international markets. We opened our international headquarters in London in June 2014, and for the year ended December 31, 2016, international customers accounted for 9% of our revenue.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to Innovate and Offer New Applications. We will continue to make significant investments to further enhance the functionality of our existing applications, expand the number of applications on our extensible learning platform and develop into adjacent markets that will benefit our customers. We take a strategic approach to research and development investment. For example, in February 2015, we launched Bridge to better serve our corporate customers because we saw corporate customers adopt Canvas, due to a lack of suitable alternatives. In October 2016, we announced the launch of Arc, our next generation video platform for interactive learning and intuitive collaboration.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arc
 Arc is a video platform that makes video learning more impactful using contextual comments, robust analytics, and seamless integration with learning management systems such as Canvas. When instructional designers use Arc to organize and deliver video content, viewers learn from each other’s insights as well as from the instructor’s direction and feedback. As part of the Canvas integration, students can upload Arc videos as assignment submissions, which allows teachers to give more relevant, contextual feedback inside the video.
Technology and Standards 
 The technologies used to build our platform and applications are native cloud, multi-tenant and designed to scale to millions of users. We utilize a modern technology stack to take advantage of advancements in web-design, open source technologies, scalability, and security. We have implemented industry-standard best security practices to help us protect our servers and our customers’ critical information. 
 Our platform and applications are hosted on cloud infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Our hosting services provide full support, rolling release upgrades/updates, backup, and disaster recovery services. We primarily use Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2, along with load balancing, auto scaling and storage, or S3, provided by AWS. Our infrastructure enables us to scale horizontally and rapidly adjust to variances in usage, at the server, database and file store level. Our applications run on virtualized instances in Tier III and Tier IV AWS data center facilities, which provide industry-standard best security practices. As of December 31, 2016, we used AWS data center facilities located in Virginia, Oregon, Dublin, Ireland, Frankfurt, Germany, Sydney, Australia and Singapore and intend to expand operations to other regions based on market conditions. These facilities have earned multiple certifications including, but not limited to, SOC 2 Type II, ISO9001 and ISO27001. 
 We designed our platform to be resilient to failure and capable of rapid recovery from component failure. We apply a wide variety of strategies to achieve enterprise-grade reliability. We have automated procedures in place to handle coordinated changes across our various instances and store backups of key databases in multiple redundant and geographically isolated locations.
 Our technology stack is a dynamic web application built with our own automated scaling and provisioning technologies. We use Web 2.0 technologies like Ruby on Rails and Node.js, which provide users a familiar web experience. Our platform is built on underlying open source technologies, taking full advantage of advancements in scalability and flexibility. We utilize the Linux operating system, Postgres and Cassandra databases, and Redis value store. Our platform also provides an API that third-parties can use to add new features and functionality. 
 Keeping the platform secure is a primary focus of our operations team due to the sensitive nature of the data contained within the platform. We maintain a high level of diligence around data security and have chosen to adopt the AICPA SOC2 set of security controls and demonstrate compliance with these controls through annual audits and web application vulnerability assessments.

Customers 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had well over 2,000 customers representing colleges, universities, school districts, and companies in more than 40 countries. Canvas is used by seven Ivy League schools and we have K-12 customers in all 50 states. The majority of our academic customers implement Canvas widely within their institutions and across school districts. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription contract. In situations where there is a single contract that applies to entities with multiple subsidiaries or divisions, universities or schools, only the entity that has contracted for our platform is counted as a customer. For example, a contracting school district is counted as a single customer even though the school district encompasses multiple schools. In 2016, no single customer represented more than 10% of our revenue. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our applications and services through a direct sales force. Our sales organization includes technical sales engineers who serve as experts in the technical aspects of our applications and customer implementations. Many of our sales efforts require us to respond to request for proposals, particularly in the higher education space and to a lesser extent in K-12, and to a minimal extent in the corporate market. As we grow internationally, we may use reseller partnerships as needed to penetrate certain new markets. 
 We engage in a variety of traditional and online marketing activities designed to provide sales lead generation and sales support and promote brand awareness. Our specific marketing activities for lead generation include advertising in trade publications, digital advertising, including search engine optimization and search engine marketing, display search and referral marketing. Brand awareness activities include press relations in business, human resources, education publications and blogs, market specific advertising campaigns and speaking engagements, and industry trade-shows and seminars. We also host InstructureCon, our annual user conference for current customers and prospects. Nearly 2,000 people attended InstructureCon 2016 in Keystone, Colorado.

Customer Success 
 We view strong customer support and services as essential for customer retention even though our applications are easy to adopt and use. The majority of our services and support is offered by phone and online audio and video conferencing rather than in person, resulting in a more efficient and cost effective business model for us and our customers. Our Customer Success department, responsible for all customer post-sale interaction, consists of employees located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Australia. Our services and support efforts include the following: 

• | Customer Success Management. We have created a strong Customer Success Management team to assist customers throughout the deployment and production lifecycle. They provide coverage available to all customers as part of their standard subscription as well as other service offerings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implementation Services. We believe that a positive onboarding experience leads to more satisfied customers, longer customer relationships and greater lifetime value. Implementation services includes training and consulting services that generally take anywhere from 30 to 90 days to complete depending on customer-side complexity and timelines. It includes regularly scheduled and highly-structured activities to ensure customers progress toward better utilizing our applications. Most of these interactions take place over the phone and through online audio and video conferencing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Training Services. Also critical to customer success is our customers’ comfort level with the features and functionality of our applications. We include training with every implementation and offer additional training for a fee. The training offered is intended to engender confidence among users so they can be successful with our platform. Most training is performed remotely by online audio and video conferencing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consulting Services. In addition to our implementation and training offerings, we provide custom application development, integrations, content services, and change management consulting. These services are architected to boost customer adoption of our applications and to drive usage of features and capabilities that are unique to Instructure, which we believe increases brand loyalty and lifetime value.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support. We provide standard support services, which can be upgraded to our premium support services to include 24/7 coverage and a more stringent service level agreement. Our Tier 1 offering includes our premium support services as well as direct support to users by our agents. We also provide extensive user guides and online videos for the ongoing education and assistance of our users.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information about Segments and Geographic Revenue
 The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision makers (“CODMs”), which are the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s CODMs evaluate the Company’s financial information and resources and assess the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. See footnotes to the consolidated financial statements for information by geographic area.
Partner Ecosystem and Integration 
 We are committed to enabling our customers to build an ecosystem for successful learning. Our open platform is central to both our technology and our strategy. 
 From a technological perspective, we remain focused on implementing industry standards like IMS Global Learning Consortium’s Learning Tools Interoperability and Caliper, allowing for robust integrations between Canvas and a large spectrum of third-party solutions to be offered to our customers. 
 Our partnership program invites third-party software, service and content providers, through an extensive library of APIs, to easily integrate with our applications and at no or minimal charge to the partner. This allows us to broaden and efficiently extend the functionality of our applications. We have over 100 partners, including Pearson, Cengage, Gooru, Ex Libris, Panopto, AspirEdu, Boundless Learning, iParadigms, Verificient Technologies, Microsoft and Harvard Business Publishing.

Research and Development 
 Our product, customer success, and sales and marketing teams operate cross-functionally and regularly engage with customers, partners and industry analysts to understand customer needs and general industry trends to enhance our existing applications. Additionally, our research and education team analyzes user data and current online learning trends and collaborates with customers to inform application development and growth into adjacent markets. Once application improvements are identified, the entire development organization works closely together to design, develop, test and launch new functionality and application updates. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments to strengthen our existing applications, and expand the number of applications on our extensible learning platform that will benefit our customers and allow us to expand into new markets. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recorded $36.0 million, $24.2 million, and $21.3 million, respectively, in research and development expenses.
Culture and Employees 
 We are passionate about making learning and working more engaging and accessible for people everywhere and we apply that same vision at Instructure every day. We maintain seven values that we believe set us apart, define our company culture and serve as a strategic advantage as they are directly aligned with the experience we strive to provide to our customers. 

• | Customer Experience. We aspire to create an awesome customer experience in every interaction with our applications and people.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Openness. Instructure is built on openness—it’s part of who we are. Open doors. Open office. Open source. We have created an open work environment without offices to increase collaboration and transparency—and to reflect the open learning platform environment we provide to our customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ownership. Everyone’s an owner because each of us can have a significant impact on our ability to succeed. Full-time Instructure employees receive equity grants and can participate in the success and growth of the company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trust. We have a clear “tell us if we’re doing something stupid” policy. Everyone is encouraged to offer input and feedback regardless of level of experience or position. Questioning the status quo is part of our DNA and supports us in continuing to disrupt and transform our markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Integrity. Simply put, we say what we’re going to do and then we do it. We hold people accountable for results and commitments. Our objectives and commitments are openly shared throughout the company.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Excellence. Achieving excellence isn’t easy. But we believe it can be simple. Instructure pursues the leading edge of innovation in our technology, support, and business operations. We do this by hiring smart, creative, passionate people and giving them opportunities to create awesome.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simplicity. Our platform is designed to make teaching, learning, and engaging easier. Everything we do—from designing software to how we communicate—should reflect that. Keep it simple and easy to understand.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since our founding, we have worked hard to retain our open and engaging culture with people who are passionate about improving learning. We have received multiple “best places to work” awards and have maintained high ratings on recruiting websites. As of December 31, 2016, we had 949 employees. 
 Competition 
 We operate in highly competitive markets. Canvas primarily competes with systems offered by Blackboard, D2L and Moodle in the education market. Bridge primarily competes with systems offered by Cornerstone OnDemand, Saba Software and SumTotal Systems (owned by Skillsoft) along with dozens of small, specialized systems for specific industries to large, generalized systems provided as part of a larger human resources management suite. 
 We may face future competition in our markets from other large, established companies, as well as from smaller specialized companies. 
 The principal competitive factors in our markets include the following: 
  
• | usability and features;
--+------------------------


• | pricing;
--+---------


• | reliability and uptime;
--+------------------------

 8


 
• | service and support for users and staff;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | software integration and third-party publisher partnerships;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | mobile capabilities;
--+---------------------


• | data analytics; and
--+--------------------


• | collaboration and engagement.
--+------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development, partner ecosystem development and customer support. In addition, many of our competitors, particularly the large software companies named above, may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories and significantly greater resources. Some competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours, which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to changes in customer needs. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not offer or develop products or services that are superior to ours or achieve greater market acceptance. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, a variety of contractual arrangements, such as license agreements, assignment agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the intellectual property used in our business. We actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks, and domain names in the United States and in other key jurisdictions, but we have not, to date, applied for patent protection for any of our inventions. We are the registered holder of a variety of U.S. and international domain names that include the term Instructure, Canvas and Bridge. 
 A substantial portion of our Canvas application, including the base code, uses “open source” software we license from third parties. Open source software is made available to the general public on an “as-is” basis under the terms of a non-negotiable license. Open source software is generally freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source licenses, like the GNU Affero General Public License may require us to offer the components of our software that incorporate the open source software for no cost, make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software, and license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. We also rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties under proprietary licenses. Though such third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available to us. 
 To promote our open platform philosophy, we make available a substantial portion of the source code for Canvas available to the public on the “GitHub” platform for no charge, under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License. We accept modifications of the source code for Canvas from contributors who agree to the terms of our contributor agreement. Our contributor agreement provides for assignment of joint ownership in the copyright to the contribution, and a license to any patent rights of the contributor. Contributors must also represent that it is an original work and that the contribution does not violate any third-party intellectual property right. 
 We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information, and all of our key employees and contractors have done so. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers. We also control and monitor access to, and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our software is available.

Regulatory 
 The legal environment of internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied in this environment, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, is often unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as data privacy and security, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, content regulation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Moreover, our academic customers are regulated at the state and federal levels by legislatures, administrative agencies and other policymaking bodies that can directly impact their ability to procure and deploy technology products. 
 Our customers, and those with whom they communicate using our applications, upload and store customer data onto our platform. This presents legal challenges to our business and operations, such as rights of privacy or intellectual property rights related to the content loaded onto our platform. Both in the United States and internationally, we must monitor and comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations regarding the data stored and processed on our platform as well as the operation of our business. 
 Data Privacy and Security Laws 
 Data privacy and security with respect to the collection of personally identifiable information, or PII, continues to be the focus of worldwide legislation and regulation. We are subject to data privacy and security regulation by data protection authorities in the U.S. (including the states in which we conduct our business) and potentially in other countries. 
 In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the unauthorized use and disclosure of individuals’ PII. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials or amending existing laws to expand compliance obligations. Federal laws are also under consideration that may create additional compliance obligations and penalties. In the European Union, where companies must meet specified privacy and security standards, the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and data protection laws of each of the European Member countries require comprehensive information privacy and security protections for consumers with respect to PII collected about them. We have in the past relied on compliance with adherence to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as agreed to and set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the European Union and Switzerland, concerning U.S. companies doing business in Europe, collecting PII from European citizens, and transferring such PII to the United States under the Safe Harbor Framework. As a result of the October 6, 2015 European Union Court of Justice, or ECJ, opinion in Case C-362/14 (Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner) regarding the adequacy of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework is now considered, within the EU, to be an invalid means of legitimizing data transfers to the United States under the Data Protection Directive and its implementations into EU member state national law. In light of the ECJ opinion in Case C-362/14, we are engaged in efforts to legitimize data transfers from the European Economic Area, such as the use of so-called ‘model contract clauses’ developed by the European Commission. On July 12, 2016, the European Commission adopted the new EU-U.S. “Privacy Shield” to replace the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and starting on August 1, 2016, the Privacy Shield was made available to companies for self-certification.  In addition, on May 4, 2016, the EU formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which will apply to all EU member states from May 25, 2018 and will replace the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC on that date.  The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of data protection rules.  In light of these developments, we plan to evaluate Privacy Shield to determine whether it is appropriate for our data transfers and any additional mechanisms necessary to ensure compliance with the GDPR. We post on our website our privacy policies and practices concerning the processing, use and disclosure of PII. Our publication of our privacy policy and other statements we publish that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices. 
 Through contractual obligations with our customers we sometimes agree to certain obligations related to The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, which generally prohibits educational institutions that receive federal funding from disclosing PII from a student’s education records without the student’s consent. We are also subject to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, which applies to operators of commercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect personal information from children, and to operators of general audience websites with actual knowledge that they are collecting information from U.S. children under the age of 13. Also, certain laws and regulations that protect the collection, use and disclosure of particular types of data may hinder our ability to provide services to customers and potential customers subjected to such laws.
