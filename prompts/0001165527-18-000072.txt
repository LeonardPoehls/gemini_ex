ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
 
Rokk3r Inc. (“we”, “us”, the “Company”, or “Rokk3r”) is incorporated in the State of Nevada.
 
Our Services and the Rokk3r Ecosystem
 
We provide a suite of services that is a hybrid network of human and machine intelligence systems, enabling early stage startup technology companies and existing businesses to develop new products and businesses in a frictionless, accelerated and comprehensive way.  Our services are designed to leverage exponential technologies to rapidly accelerate and shape industries. These exponential technologies include artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality (AR, VR), blockchain (decentralized ledger technologies), data science, digital biology and biotech, machine learning, nanotech, robotics and sensors. By taking into account modern economic theories (abundance), exponential organizations (ExOs) factors, exponential technologies, increased global connectivity, and the rise of a collective global genius, we seek to optimize rates of success in company building and product development by offering a broader range of essential services in one place. We provide these services to allow our clients to focus on the creative aspects of building a business or creating new products and relieve them with the burden of developing an operational and development infrastructure.
 
The Rokk3r Ecosystem is being designed to provide our clients with global access to education, idea validation, team creation and experts who collaborate to build ventures (a process we call crowd building) and position them for potential future growth.  Physical locations we are calling “Rokk3r Hubs” are planned for launch in select emerging and established economies that we believe will enable entrepreneurs, investors and talent to participate in the expected growth of our clients’ businesses.
 
Our Market
 
A rise in the number of people connected to the internet from 3 billion to 6 billion over the next 5 to 10 years is projected to lead to trillions of dollars of online commerce. These increases have led to a new breed of visionaries, designers, developers and creators who are seeking to leverage exponential technologies to build companies who develop new software applications, products and business solutions to address global needs.
 
We believe that the solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges lie in the intersection of exponential technologies. That is, when two or more of these technologies are used in combination to attack a persistent challenge, the possibility of developing a sustainable solution becomes much more likely.
 
For example, consider a potential healthcare solution that leverages machine learning, public health records, and individual genetic profiles to help prevent heart disease. Or, consider another solution that might use personal health records, a new biosensor, and the data from smartphones to predict the presence of cancer. These are the types of solutions we are trying to enable through the innovation and learning platform we provide.
 
Furthermore, it is well known that a high percentage of entrepreneurs fail, with reasons running from inability to find product market fit, to not being able to recruit the appropriate talent to not receiving funding at the right time.  We believe that the infrastructure for entrepreneurs who seek to develop new technologies does not match up with the demand for new applications. Yesteryear solutions of leveraging close contacts to get work done and raising funds from family and friends when it really matters is not always effective.  Even in today’s hyper-connected world, we believe innovation is hampered by where you are, the lack of access to investors, mentors, technology resources and access to the global economy. We believe these limitations create a need for an infrastructure and ecosystem that provides an overall, global entrepreneurial solution. A limitation addressed by our Rokk3r Ecosystem.
 
Our Marketing Efforts and Plans
 
Our goal is to make it possible for anyone, anywhere to participate in our public-market based, blockchain-driven, exponential company building ecosystem. We plan to unlock the process of company building and have been actively marketing our advisory services in the U.S., Latin America and the U.K. to meet the needs of this market. We expect to add new consulting clients through these enhanced marketing efforts coupled with increasing demand from U.S. based technology companies seeking our services. We will continue to focus our efforts on companies that utilize technology in their software applications, business process or products that fulfill a need in daily living. We believe these companies have the greatest potential for growth and profitability and are in need of business development services and capital.

Our marketing efforts include sponsoring trade symposiums, investment forums, formation of strategic alliances with industry and trade associations and educational institutions and our presence on the Internet.
     Principal Suppliers
 
We believe we will have adequate access to a qualified development team for the services we are offering.
 
Competition
 
The services we offer compete with the services offered by entities and individuals seeking to take advantage of the growing need of companies seeking management advice in order to develop new products and technologies and obtain access to U.S. capital markets for their expansion. This competition ranges from large management consulting firms and investment banks that offer a broad range of consulting and financial services, to small companies and independent contractors that provide specialized services. Many of the firms prospecting these clients are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Furthermore, we acknowledge we are competing with firms that may possess greater financial, marketing, technical, human and other resources. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to offer a wider range of value-added services than our competitors. In light of the sheer numbers of companies and individuals seeking to expand or develop new products and technologies, we believe it is difficult for early stage companies to convert ideas into products or businesses, attract interest in the financial community, make acquisitions and increase revenues and profitability.  We believe our company is well positioned to assist these early stage companies.
Government Regulation
 
We believe we are in substantial compliance with all governmental regulations applicable to our business. We will employ a number of external resources to assist us in complying with our regulatory obligations. These external resources will include outside technology providers and consultants. As we expand our business, we will be required to raise additional capital to cover the expected increase in costs to hire and train additional internal and external resources to ensure we remain in substantial compliance with our governmental obligations.
Patents and Trademarks
 
We do not own any patents or trademarks.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2018, we have no full-time employees. However, our controlling shareholder, Rokk3r Labs, provides us with the services of its employees, contractors and third-party software developers on an as-needed basis pursuant to a Collaboration Agreement. See Item 13.
