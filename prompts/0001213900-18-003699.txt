ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Propel is a holding company for Propel Media, Kitara and DeepIntent.
 
Propel is a diversified online advertising company. Propel generates revenues through the sale of advertising to advertisers who want to reach consumers in the United States and internationally to promote their products and services.
 
Propel delivers advertising, including via its real-time, bid-based, online advertising platform called Propel Media Platform. This technology platform allows advertisers to target audiences and deliver video, display and text based advertising. Propel and its Propel Media Platform provide advertisers with an effective way to serve, manage and maximize the performance of their online advertising purchasing. Propel offers both a self-serve platform and a managed services option that give advertisers diverse solutions to reach online audiences and acquire customers. As of December 31, 2017 Propel had over 1,100 advertiser customers and served millions of ads per day.
 
Propel primarily serves its advertising to users who are part of our owned and operated member-based network or the member-based networks of our third party application partners. Propel provides its audience with access to its premium content for free and obtains the users’ permission to serve advertising to them while they peruse content on the web. In this model, Propel also serves advertising through partners who acquire users by providing a variety of applications free of charge and such partners receive permission from their users to serve ads to them. In this model, advertising units are served directly to users through a browser extension or other software installed on the user’s computer.
 
Propel’s offerings to its advertising customers will increasingly leverage DeepIntent’s integrated data and programmatic buying platform, which the Company acquired in connection with the acquisition of DeepIntent in January 2017, to improve performance for its advertisers. The DeepIntent platform provides a data-driven approach to programmatic advertising that integrates into its data management platform traditional first-party data (such as client CRM data) and cookie-based third-party user data in order to build an enriched profile of a brand’s target audiences. Leveraging DeepIntent’s artificial intelligence tools, these profiles are supplemented with real-time consumer interest data using DeepIntent’s proprietary Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. With a holistic view of each user’s interests and behaviors, DeepIntent’s demand side platform provides tools to accurately price the value of each user with respect to the goals of the advertiser while simultaneously providing brands with the confidence that their ads will appear in a “brand safe” environment. Additionally, DeepIntent’s platform provides the Company with the ability to offer its advertisers programmatic inventory across all screens, including desktop, mobile, tablet and connected TV.
 
Propel also provides solutions to advertisers through its publisher business model with a channel of direct publishers, networks and exchanges. These supply channels expand our ability to serve advertising. In this model, the advertising units are served to users through a website, and we serve advertising units to the user in coordination with the publisher, network or exchange.
 
Propel’s principal executive office is located at 2010 Main Street, Suite 900, Irvine, CA 92614. Its telephone number at that location is (949) 251-0640.
 
History and Structure of Our Company
 
Overview
 
Propel was incorporated in Delaware on October 7, 2014 for the purpose of completing the Transactions (as defined below). Prior to the completion of the Transactions, Propel had no assets and did not conduct any material activities other than those incidental to its formation. Upon completion of the Transactions, the businesses of Propel Media and Kitara became the business of Propel. In February 2015, Propel’s common stock began trading on the OTC Pink Market, operated by OTC Markets Group (“OTC Pink Market”) under the trading symbol “PROM.”
Business Combination
 
On January 28, 2015, Propel consummated the “reverse merger” (the “Reverse Merger” or the “Transactions”) as contemplated by (i) the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of October 10, 2014, by and among Kitara, Propel Media, which was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kitara, and Kitara Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), which was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Propel, and (ii) the Unit Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of October 10, 2014 and amended as of December 23, 2014, April 29, 2015 and January 26, 2016 by and among Kitara, Propel, Propel Media and the former members of Propel Media (“Transferors”).

Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, in addition to the consideration paid in connection with the closing of the Transactions and the earn-out payable if the Company reaches certain financial performance thresholds for the fiscal years 2015 to 2018 (none of which have been met to date), the Company incurred a deferred payment obligation of (i) $10,000,000 to the Transferors (“Deferred Obligation”), which is payable in cash and/or stock not later than June 30, 2019, and (ii) $6,000,000 payable in cash immediately after the payment of certain fees to the Lenders on or about January 28, 2019, (the “Deferred Payment”). The Company can pay the Deferred Obligation from an equity financing or from available working capital. The Company is required to use its reasonable best efforts to complete equity financings that would raise sufficient net proceeds to pay the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation in cash to the Transferors on or before June 30, 2019 (the “Equity Financing Period”). In addition, the Company’s board of directors, at least two times per year during the Equity Financing Period, is obligated to determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, the amount, if any, of the Company’s working capital available to be used to pay all or a portion of the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation in cash, taking into account such factors as it may deem relevant. If the Company’s board of directors determines that there is available working capital to pay all or a portion of the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation, the Company must use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain any required lender consent and, if such consent is obtained, must promptly pay to the Transferors an amount in cash equal to such available working capital. Finally, Jared Pobre, one of the Transferors, on behalf of the Transferors, is permitted to elect, during the ten day period following each December 31st during the Equity Financing Period, commencing December 31, 2016, to receive any unpaid amount of the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation in shares of the Company’s common stock. For such issuance, each share of the Company’s common stock will be valued at the closing market price of the Company’s common stock as reported on NASDAQ or such other national securities exchange on which the Company’s Common Stock is listed (or if not so listed, the bid price on the OTC Pink Market) on the date on which such shares are issued to the Transferors (and if a closing price or bid price, as applicable, is not reported on such day, then the stock shall be valued at the last closing price or bid price, as applicable, reported).
 
Acquisition of DeepIntent
 
On June 21, 2017 (“DeepIntent Closing Date”), pursuant to a stock purchase agreement (“DeepIntent Acquisition Agreement”) with the former stockholders of DeepIntent, Propel purchased 100% of the equity interests of DeepIntent, consisting of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock of DeepIntent. The purchase price, which is subject to an adjustment for working capital, consisted of $4,000,000 paid at closing, $500,000 which was paid on December, 21, 2017 and, $500,000 payable on June 21, 2018 (collectively, the “Deferred Payments”). In addition, the sellers may earn up to an aggregate of $3,000,000 of additional consideration upon the achievement of certain performance levels during the years ending December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (collectively, the “Earnouts”).
 
Debt Financing 
 
On January 28, 2015, in connection with the closing of the Transactions, Propel, Kitara and Propel Media, as “Borrowers,” and certain of their subsidiaries, as “Guarantors,” entered into a financing agreement, as amended on December 23, 2016, May 30, 2017, June 21, 2017 and November 10, 2017 (“Financing Agreement”), with certain financial institutions as lenders (“Lenders”), HPS Investment Partners, LLC (formerly known as Highbridge Principal Strategies, LLC) (“Highbridge”), as collateral agent for the Lenders (“Collateral Agent”), and PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”), as a Lender and administrative agent for the Lenders (“Administrative Agent”).
 
The Financing Agreement provided the Borrowers with (a) a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $81,000,000 (the “Term Loan”) and (b) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $15,000,000 at any time outstanding (the “Revolving Loan” and, together with the Term Loan, the “Loans”). The Loans will mature on January 28, 2019 (“Final Maturity Date”). The company intends to refinance the obligation under the Loans.
 
The outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan is repayable in consecutive quarterly installments in equal amounts of $1,750,000 on the last day of each March, June, September and December commencing on March 31, 2015, except that the payment due on March 31, 2015 was $1,219,000. The Term Loan is subject to an annual excess cash flow sweep, pursuant to which a principal payment of $2,149,000 was made in April 2017. The remaining balance of the Term Loan and the Revolving Loan are due and payable on the Final Maturity Date, except in certain limited circumstances.
 
The Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow the Revolving Loan prior to the Final Maturity Date, subject to the terms, provisions and limitations set forth in the Financing Agreement. The outstanding principal amount of advances may not at any time exceed the lesser of $15,000,000 or the borrowing base.

Subject to the terms of the Financing Agreement, outstanding amounts under the Term Loan bear interest, from the date of the Term Loan until repaid, at a rate per annum equal to 9.00% plus either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) (but not less than 1% and not more than 3%) for the interest period in effect for the Term Loan (or such portion thereof), or (ii) the bank’s reference rate. For each interest period, the Company may choose to pay interest under either the LIBOR or reference rate method.
 
Subject to the terms of the Financing Agreement, the Company may have multiple revolving loans under the revolving loan arrangement. Each revolving loan shall bear interest on the principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding, from the date of such Loan until repaid, at a rate per annum equal to 6.00% plus either (i) the LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such Loan (but LIBOR may not be less than 1%), or (ii) the bank’s reference rate. For each revolving loan, the Company can choose to borrow either at the LIBOR or the reference rate.  
 
The obligations of the Borrowers under the Financing Agreement are secured by first priority security interests granted to the Lenders on all of the Borrowers’ and Guarantors’ tangible and intangible property, including accounts receivable, intellectual property and shares and membership interests of the Borrowers (other than Propel) and the Guarantors.
 
The Financing Agreement and other loan documents provide for certain customary fees and other amounts to be paid to the Lenders at the closing of the Financing Agreement (approximately $3,000,000), during the term of the Financing Agreement (approximately $900,000) and on the fourth anniversary of the closing date of the Financing Agreement ($12,500,000).
 
On June 21, 2017, the Borrowers (as defined below) entered into an amendment to the Financing Agreement (“Amendment No. 2”), the purpose of which was to allow for the Company’s consummation of the DeepIntent Acquisition Agreement. In connection with Amendment No. 2, on October 2, 2017 we paid an amendment fee (“Amendment Fee”) of $752,000. The Amendment Fee has been reflected as interest expense, net, within the consolidated statement of operations.
 
The Financing Agreement and other loan documents contain customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the Borrowers’ ability to, among other things, create certain liens, make certain types of borrowings and engage in certain mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, asset sales and affiliate transactions. The Financing Agreement also contains a financial covenant, as discussed in Item 7 below. The Financing Agreement provides for customary events of default, including, among other things, if a change of control of Propel occurs. The Loans may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.

Opportunity
 
We believe the online advertising market is well positioned for growth with expanded ways in which audiences can connect to the Internet across a variety of devices. Market forecasts are anticipating significant growth in advertising spending across all major digital ad formats as follows:

1. | U.S. mobile advertising spending in 2018 is forecasted to be $70.05 billion growing to $82.31 billion in 2019. (eMarketer) 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | U.S. display advertising spending in 2018 is forecasted to be $48.42 billion growing to $54.68 billion in 2019. (eMarketer) 
3. | U.S. video advertising spending in 2018 is forecasted to be $15.42 billion growing to $17.56 billion in 2019. (eMarketer) 
4. | U.S. native advertising spending in 2018 is forecasted to be $25.2 billion growing to $28.9 billion in 2019. (Business Insider Intelligence) 

 
Propel is positioning itself to take advantage of these major industry growth trends.
 
Strategy
 
Propel participates in the online advertising market where advertisers reward providers who can deliver performance and return on advertising investment. The fundamental strategy of the business is to drive advertiser performance across all media and geographies. Key elements of the Propel strategy include:

1. | Increasing quality inventory from supply sources that deliver improved advertiser performance. This includes increasing Propel’s owned and operated member-based network through increased investment in media buying to acquire users. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Expanding revenues that come from video advertisers. As more advertiser budget moves from television to online, we see opportunities to increase the revenue we generate from distributing video advertisements on behalf of our advertisers. 
3. | Expanding revenues that come from display advertisers. As display advertising budgets continue to increase, we see the opportunity to increase revenues we generate from distributing display advertisements on behalf of our advertisers. 
4. | Expanding ad inventory by increasing our publisher-based syndication program to expand supply for video and display advertisements. 
5. | Migrating into the mobile market to take advantage of advertiser demand for this segment of the market.

Business
 
Overview
 
Propel generates revenue by selling advertising to advertisers and serving the advertising to users while they browse the Internet. We have two monetization models.
 
In one model (which we sometimes refer to herein as the “member-based business”), we have a direct relationship with users who have installed an extension in the users’ browsers or software that allows us to serve them advertising through their browsers as an overlay image on the content that they are viewing or in a new browser window or tab. In this model, we have no publisher relationship and as a result no publisher payments. We acquire a relationship with users in two ways: (i) through our owned and operated properties and (ii) through properties developed by our third party application partners. In each case, a user who is offered free access to our owned and operated property or to the third party application partner’s property agrees to receive advertisements served by us from advertisers using our Propel Media Platform as they browse the Internet. This allows us or our third party application partners to install an extension to the user’s browser or download software onto the user’s computer. The extension or software allows us to travel with the user as the user views content on the Internet. We capture the URLs and keywords of certain browsing pages viewed, and in real time determine if we have advertisers who have bid on keywords or the URL being browsed. If so, we serve the relevant advertising. In some situations, we have advertisers who wish to have us serve advertising on a run-of-network basis, which then permits us to serve ads across our user base without targeting parameters being established.
 
During 2017, as we focused on growing our user base via the marketing of our owned and operated properties, such as free casual games and free lifestyle content. We continue to have a distinct media buying organization that purchases advertising on various online ad platforms and is dedicated to developing the user base acquired through our owned and operated properties for our member-based business model.
 
In the second model (which we sometimes refer to herein as the “publisher business model”), we develop publisher based syndication supply channels through relationships with web publishers, exchanges and other supply channels. In this model, there is a direct publisher relationship and we use the traffic from publishers as the user base to whom we serve ads. No extension or software is downloaded or otherwise used. In this model, we enter into a revenue share or CPM (as defined below) payment model with the publisher.
 
Propel’s offerings to its advertising customers will increasingly leverage DeepIntent’s integrated data and programmatic buying platform to improve performance for its advertisers. The DeepIntent platform provides a data-driven approach to programmatic advertising that integrates into its data management platform traditional first-party data (such as client CRM data) and cookie-based third-party user data in order to build an enriched profile of a brand’s target audiences. Leveraging DeepIntent’s artificial intelligence tools, these profiles are supplemented with real-time consumer interest data using DeepIntent’s proprietary Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. With a holistic view of each user’s interests and behaviors, DeepIntent’s demand side platform provides tools to accurately price the value of each user with respect to the goals of the advertiser while simultaneously providing brands with the confidence that their ads will appear in a “brand safe” environment. Additionally, the DeepIntent platform provides the Company with the ability to offer its advertisers programmatic inventory across all screens, including desktop, mobile, tablet and connected TV.
 
Advertiser Sales and Account Management
 
Propel is focused on building relationships with digital advertisers.
 
Propel currently services over 1,100 advertisers and its advertiser clients include, but are not limited to, direct advertisers, affiliate advertisers, lead generation advertisers, leading advertising agencies and advertising networks and exchanges representing premium brands.
 
Propel’s sales team and account management organization are comprised, collectively, of 24 employees. They call on and support advertisers and their advertising campaigns. The sales and account management teams are responsible for acquiring new advertisers, developing campaign goals and strategies with advertisers or their agents and working with the clients to establish the ad formats that will run. They are also responsible for developing the return on investment metrics with the advertiser that will be used to help the account management organization or the advertiser understand performance as the campaign is running and will allow the account management organization, the salesperson and the advertiser to optimize campaigns to meet campaign goals.

Campaigns are set up and managed by either the salesperson, account manager or the advertiser themselves. These activities are executed through the Propel Media Platform. This platform allows Propel to work with advertisers to:
 

● | Process advertiser applications; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Accept or reject advertiser applications; 
● | Record advertiser information, payment terms and semi-automate the advance payment process through credit card or wire transfer, if required; 


● | Set up campaigns including: 
--+--------------------------------


o | Specifying the ad units to be employed for the campaign, which include: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Video ads –Video ads are served to its audience on a run-of-network basis and the advertiser is charged when the ad is displayed (this is priced on a Cost Per Thousand Impressions, or CPM). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
§ | Display ads – These are traditional box ads combining graphical images with ad copy. These ads are served based on targeted keywords. The advertiser is charged when the ad is displayed (this is referred to as Cost Per View, or CPV). 
§ | Textlink ads – Ads that appear when the consumer places the mouse cursor over the targeted keyword. If the user clicks on the ad, the user is taken to the advertiser’s offer landing page that provides more information. The advertiser is only charged if the consumer clicks on the ad (this is referred to as Cost Per Click, or CPC). 


o | Establishing targeting parameters by keywords and URLs that the advertiser chooses. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | Establishment of bid price for keywords and URLs. As the Propel Media Platform is a bid-based platform, the advertiser’s ad will be displayed if its bid price wins over other advertisers who are also bidding to serve their ads. 
o | Establish links to ad creative that will run in each campaign. 


● | Generate reports and metrics that allow real time campaign performance management. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Audience Development
 
Propel advertisers’ campaigns are dependent on having an audience to receive the advertising. Propel’s model is to reach its audience either directly or via partners.
 
Propel reaches audiences for its advertisers through two different business models:
 

● | The member-based business model acquires a relationship with users in two ways: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Owned and Operated Properties. Propel develops and distributes multiple free casual gaming, lifestyle and other content properties. In this method, Propel buys media and advertises these gaming sites and lifestyle content properties on various online destinations, including casual gaming and social media portals. Propel provides its audience with access to its premium gaming and lifestyle content for free and obtains the user’s permission to serve advertising to them while they peruse content on the web. Propel incurs media costs to acquire audiences in this manner. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | Application Partners’ Properties. Propel partners with third party application developers who have their own audience bases and are seeking to serve advertising to them. In this instance, Propel partners with these third party application developers to increase the total audience that Propel’s advertisers can reach with their advertisements. Propel operates under a revenue share model with its partners in this distribution model. 


● | The publisher business model serves advertising through publisher based syndication supply channels. In this model, Propel develops direct relationships with publishers, networks and exchanges for supply and then purchases impressions from these supply sources. Propel operates under a revenue share model or on a fixed CPM with its partners in this distribution model. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During 2017, as we further transitioned away from the declining revenues from third party application partners, we focused on growing our user base via the marketing of our owned and operated properties, such as free casual games and lifestyle content. This led to 84% of our 2017 revenue being generated by our owned and operated audience. Our revenue mix is expected to continue to be heavily weighted to supply coming from owned and operated audience and publisher business as opposed to our third party application partners.
 
Solutions, Technology & Services
 
Propel offers advertisers the ability to reach audiences in which performance is measured by their willingness to view an ad or click through to the advertisers’ landing pages for more information or to complete a conversion action as defined by the advertiser. Typical conversions might include, for example, making a purchase, filling out an automobile test drive form, taking a survey or filling out a request for more information from online education providers. Superior performance is achieved by having engaging ad units that target the right audiences and are served at the right scale and frequency. Although most creative work is done by the client, Propel offers design services to help improve campaign performance through more impactful creative ads and landing pages. Propel offers video, display and text link ad units that are designed for maximum impact and conversions.
 
Audience targeting is achieved through keywords and URLs. Advertisers bid on keyword and URL targets which they believe will be relevant to the content that their audiences will be consuming. An advertiser will bid on anywhere from a few to thousands of keywords and URLs at varying bid prices based on the importance of the keyword or URL and the competition from other advertisers for that same keyword or URL. Advertisers may raise or lower keyword or URL bid prices as they see how effective various keywords or URLs perform for their campaigns. If a keyword or URL target is performing well for an advertiser, the advertiser may want to increase the number of individuals clicking on the advertiser’s advertisements. This is accomplished by raising the bid price the advertiser is willing to pay to have the advertiser’s ad served, which in turn will generate more impressions and, hopefully, increased conversions. Conversely, if a keyword or URL is not performing, bid prices might be lowered in order to not spend advertising budget on underperforming keywords or URLs.

Propel’s proprietary ad serving technologies are geared toward optimizing direct response advertiser campaigns to ensure that the desired performance criteria are generated within advertiser defined cost parameters. It is through Propel’s ad serving technologies that Propel matches advertisers with targeted audiences in a real time auction environment. Propel’s ad serving technologies determine if there are relevant keywords or URLs on the webpage that an audience member is perusing and that an advertiser or advertisers are targeting. It then evaluates the parameters for serving an ad, including the number of times an audience member has been exposed to a particular ad, the time intervals between ads, the competitive bid prices, the conversion data, time of day parameters that the advertiser has chosen to show ads and other relevant segmenting options. The ad server then decides which advertiser’s ad to serve, if any, to a particular audience member. This generally takes place in the 150 milliseconds that it generally takes a webpage to load on a computer and occurs tens of millions of times per day.
 
Propel Media Platform is the Propel advertiser interface platform that registers campaign input parameters that drive its ad serving to carry out campaigns as defined by the advertiser. The Propel Media Platform interface allows advertisers to establish and direct what and where creative assets (ads) are to be found, the keyword, URL and geographic targets for each campaign, the bid price for each keyword and URL target, day part serving parameters, serving intervals between ad impressions, budget parameters on a daily basis and other segmenting options.
 
Key benefits of the platform are:
 

● | Comprehensive – Self-serve platform, with managed account solutions 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cost Effective – Bid Based, Cost per Click (CPC), Cost per View (CPV) and Cost Per Thousand (CPM) pricing 
● | Targeted Data – Capable of targeting based on a variety of attributes, such as frequency caps and time of day 
● | Performance Goal Oriented – Designed for direct response, performance driven advertisers and brand marketers based on defined event results 
● | Diverse Solutions – Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) standard Display and Video formats available 
● | Scalable – Capable of handling thousands of advertisers and billions of ad impressions monthly 

 
The Propel Media Platform provides an easy to use self-service interface that allows for the building of customized ad campaigns with contextually targeted ads. The platform also provides performance traffic and budget management capabilities to meet key goals.
 
The platform is currently servicing over 1,100 advertisers. Propel solutions deliver effective results for advertisers that allow them to target and reach mass audiences with high performance results across text, display and video formats. The reporting and analytics interface allows advertisers to see campaign performance in real-time. Campaign optimization and management is all performed through the Propel Media Platform interface.
 
Video Offerings
 
In 2017, Propel focused on expanding its video offerings to existing and new advertisers on our user network (the member-based business model) and on our expanding syndication network of publishers, exchanges and marketplaces (the publisher business model).
 
Propel is focused on delivering a set of comprehensive solutions supported by industry leading services and a proven video advertising technology platform.
 
Propel’s objective is to ensure that every online advertising campaign dynamically achieves key performance metrics through brand-safe delivery to the right audience against relevant content in engaging interactive video ad formats. We believe consumers are spending more time online watching video content and advertisers are increasingly shifting budgets from television to online platforms.
 
The Propel video solutions are designed to address the needs of traditional direct relationships with brands and their agencies as well as the expanding evolution of programmatic advertisers. We believe that regardless of how online advertising campaigns are executed, whether by media buying or through programmatic automation, the same elements of relevant content, audiences and performance are required to optimize brand value.

Competition
 
Propel operates in a dynamic and competitive market, influenced by trends across multiple industries, including, but not limited to, the digital advertising industry, the video content marketing industry and the digital publishing industry. We expect that competition in Propel’s industry will continue to intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation, the continuing maturation of the industry and low barriers to entry.
 
The display, video, desktop application and online advertising solutions market is highly competitive, with many companies providing competing solutions. Propel competes with Google, RythmOne, Criteo, IAC, Facebook, The Trade Desk, Vibrant and many demand side advertiser platforms, supply side advertising platforms, ad networks, exchanges and desktop and mobile applications.
 
We believe that Propel competes favorably with an emphasis on key competitive factors, including strong relationships with online advertisers, publishers and third party application developers, an advanced and scalable technology platform, effective audience engagement and goal-based performance, data driven benchmarks and brand and campaign metrics for advertising campaigns, brand safety and proven performance. With respect to these factors, we believe that Propel’s effective, scalable and stable goal based performance platform well positions Propel as an independent provider of online advertising solutions.
 
Technology and Development
 
Propel’s technology and development efforts are focused on investing in its Propel Media Platform and a suite of complementary services. Much of its technology and development is conducted through a consulting arrangement with Bravo Studio d.o.o., which arrangement dates back to 2009. Pursuant to the consulting arrangement, Bravo Studio d.o.o. provides Propel with ongoing software and technology development services and support. Any intellectual property that is created within the scope of the consulting arrangement is owned by Propel. The consulting arrangement is terminable by either party upon 15 days’ prior written notice to the other party. Development efforts are also conducted through the Company’s DeepIntent operations, with development personnel located both in the United States and in India. Propel has incurred approximately $4,021,000 and $3,488,000 in technology and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Propel continues to develop a robust platform to enable automation and optimization of online advertising and publisher inventory. Propel’s strategy incorporates enhanced optimization management capabilities for video, display and text ad units. Capitalizing on proprietary and third-party data tools and reporting functionality, Propel will continue to analyze audience insights and offer reporting functionalities to provide Propel and its advertisers, publishers and third party application developers with a transparent understanding of Propel’s performance.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Propel’s ability to protect its intellectual property, including its technologies, will be an important factor in the success and continued growth of its business. Propel has established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of its proprietary information such as the use of license agreements with customers and its use of confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with its employees, consultants, business partners and advisors where appropriate. These methods, however, may not afford complete protection for Propel’s intellectual property and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop technologies similar or superior to those of Propel.
 
Propel currently has secured one patent which expires on July 16, 2033, and has multiple trademarks protecting its intellectual property and its brands.
 
Government Regulation
 
Propel is subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that are applicable to companies engaged in the online advertising business. In addition, many areas of law that apply to Propel’s business are still evolving, and could potentially affect its business to the extent they restrict its business practices or impose a greater risk of liability. We are aware of several ongoing lawsuits filed against companies in Propel’s industry alleging various violations of privacy or data security related laws.

Privacy
 
Privacy and data protection laws and regulations play a significant role in Propel’s industry. In the United States, at both the state and federal level, there are laws that govern activities such as the collection, use and disclosure of data by companies like Propel.
 
Online advertising activities in the United States have primarily been subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which has regularly relied upon Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or Section 5, to enforce against unfair and deceptive trade practices. Section 5 has been the primary regulatory tool used to enforce against alleged violations of consumer privacy interests. In addition, as Propel continues expanding into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, Propel increasingly becomes subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how it conducts business. In particular, European data protection laws can be more restrictive regarding the collection, use and disclosure of data than those in the United States.
 
Additionally, U.S. and foreign governments have enacted, considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants’ ability to collect, augment, analyze, use and share anonymous data, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tools to track people online.
 
The European Union (the “EU”), and some EU member states have already implemented legislation and regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which was adopted by the EU in 2016 and becomes effective May 25, 2018, requiring advertisers to obtain specific types of notice and consent from individuals before using cookies or other technologies to track individuals and their online behavior and deliver targeted advertisements. It remains a possibility that additional legislation and regulations may be passed or otherwise issued in the future.
 
Propel also participates in industry self-regulatory programs under which, in addition to other compliance obligations, it provides consumers with notice about its use of cookies and its collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of its offerings. The rules and policies of the self-regulatory programs that Propel participates in are updated from time to time and may impose additional restrictions upon it in the future.
 
Any failure, or perceived failure, by Propel to comply with U.S. federal, state, or international laws or regulations pertaining to privacy or data protection, or other policies, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in proceedings or actions against it by governmental entities or others.
 
Advertising Content
 
Even though Propel’s advertisers create the content of their ads and Propel receives contractual protections from its advertisers, Propel may nevertheless be subject to regulations concerning the content of their ads. Federal and state laws governing intellectual property or other third-party rights could apply to the content of ads Propel places even if it has no part in the creation of the ad. Laws and regulations regarding unfair and deceptive advertising, sweepstakes, advertising to children and other consumer protection regulations, may also apply to the ads Propel places on behalf of clients.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, Propel had 54 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. None of Propel’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Propel considers its relationship with its employees to be good.
 
Internet Address/Availability of Reports
 
Propel is subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and files or furnishes annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.
