ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
We are a global provider of trading services and solutions, specializing in over-the-counter, or OTC, and exchange-traded markets. Our retail, institutional and futures segments service customers in more than 180 countries worldwide, and we conduct business from our offices in Bedminster, New Jersey; Jersey City, New Jersey; Chicago, Illinois; Powell, Ohio; London, England; Cornwall, England; Tokyo, Japan; Sydney, Australia; Shanghai, China; Pembroke, Bermuda; Hong Kong; Dubai, U.A.E.; Zurich, Switzerland; and Singapore.
We have invested considerable resources since our inception to develop our proprietary trading platforms to provide our customers with advanced price discovery, trade execution and order management functions, while improving our ability to acquire and service our customers efficiently, as well as manage market and credit risk associated with our customer’s trading activity. Today our customers can trade through web-based, downloadable and mobile trading platforms and have access to innovative trading tools to assist them with research and analysis, automated trading and account management.
We operate our business in three segments. Through our retail segment, we provide customers around the world access to a diverse range of global financial markets. We offer our customers access to over 12,500 financial products, including spot foreign exchange (forex), precious metals trading, as well as contracts for difference (CFDs), which are investment products with returns linked to the performance of underlying assets. We offer CFDs on currencies, commodities, indices, individual equities, bonds, options and interest rate products. In the United Kingdom, we offer spread bets, which are investment products similar to CFDs, but that offer more favorable tax treatment for residents of that country. In addition to these OTC products, our futures segment offers exchange-traded futures and options on futures on more than 30 global exchanges. Our institutional segment offers access to markets in spot and forward foreign exchange and precious metals via our GTX platform, as well as agency execution services. We provide deep liquidity in spot and forward foreign exchange and precious metals to buy-side and sell-side firms, including banks, brokers, hedge funds, Commodity Trading Advisors and asset managers. Each of our operating segments is discussed in more detail below. For financial information regarding our segments, please refer to Note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
As a global provider of online trading services, our results of operations are impacted by a number of external factors, including market volatility, competition, the regulatory environment in the various jurisdictions and markets in which we operate and the financial condition of the retail and institutional customers to whom we provide our services. These factors are not the only factors that impacted our results of operations for the most recent fiscal period, and additional factors may impact our results of operations in future periods. In addition, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of other factors that may impact our business.

Growth Strategies
We intend to grow our business and increase our profitability principally by employing the following strategies:


• | Pursuing organic growth by:

5


• | Leveraging our global footprint and powerful brand assets to increase our overall share in the markets we operate.


• | Focusing on the development of our direct business versus our lower margin indirect business;


• | Providing an attractive proposition to address the needs of our two distinct customer segments: experienced active traders and retail investors; and


• | Introducing new, innovative products and services; including upgraded and enhanced trading platforms and tools as well as digital advisory products.


• | Increasing operational excellence by:


• | Increasing automation, thereby reducing service costs;


• | Simplifying our technology “stack”;


• | Rationalizing our brands across our three business segments; and


• | Seeking to achieve an optimal balance between insourcing versus outsourcing.


• | Reducing revenue volatility through:


• | Reducing the variability between customer transaction revenue (CTR) and reported results;


• | Implementing artificial intelligence driven hedging programs;


• | Decreasing the cost of hedging; and


• | Further optimizing trade flow.


• | We will also continue to selectively review mergers and acquisitions and other inorganic opportunities which complement our organic growth strategy.

Our Retail Segment
Our retail segment represented 74.9% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. We conduct our retail business primarily through our FOREX.com and City Index brands. As of December 31, 2017, we had 185,729 funded retail accounts.
Through our retail segment, we provide customers around the world access to a diverse range of global financial markets. We offer our customers access to over 12,500 financial products, including spot foreign exchange (forex), precious metals trading, as well as contracts for difference (CFDs), which are investment products with returns linked to the performance of underlying assets. We offer CFDs on currencies, commodities, indices, individual equities, bonds, options and interest rate products. In the United Kingdom, we offer spread bets, which are investment products similar to CFDs, but that offer more favorable tax treatment for residents of that country. We offer these products under the diverse regulatory environments in which we operate. Because of U.S. regulations, neither we, nor our subsidiaries, offer CFDs or spread bets in the United States or to U.S. residents.
We seek to attract and support our customers through direct and indirect channels. Our primary direct channels for our retail segment are our Internet websites, FOREX.com and Cityindex.com, which are available in multiple languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Our indirect channel includes our relationships with introducing brokers, who solicit customers on our behalf, and white label partners, who offer our trading services to their customers under their own brand. Total retail trading volume sourced through direct and indirect channels was 67% and 33%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
We generate revenue in our retail segment principally from transaction fees we charge our customers, including the bid/offer spread, financing charges for positions held overnight, commissions on equity CFD trades and advisory services, and other account related fees.
In 2017, we generated approximately 72.7% of our retail segment trading volume from customers outside the United States. For a discussion of the risks associated with our retail segment operations outside the United States, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
The following sections provide additional information regarding our retail business:

Innovative trading tools
We have made significant investment in the development and support of our award-winning proprietary trading technology in order to provide our customers with an enhanced customer experience and multiple ways to trade and manage their accounts, tailored to their level of experience and preferred mode of access. In addition, we selectively offer third party trading tools that we believe complement our proprietary offerings. We believe that our proprietary trading technology has and will continue to provide us with a significant competitive advantage because we have the ability to adapt quickly to our customers’ changing needs, rapidly incorporate new products and features and offer our customers multiple ways to engage with us.
Competitive pricing and fast, accurate trade execution
We have longstanding relationships with a large number of institutional liquidity providers, as well as access to multiple liquidity venues. This allows us to offer our customers superior liquidity and more competitive pricing with tighter bid/offer spreads than many of our competitors. In addition, we have developed a proprietary pricing engine that electronically aggregates quotes from our liquidity sources. This ensures that our prices accurately reflect current market price levels and allows us to provide our customers high-speed trade execution. In 2017, we handled over 14 million trade requests and executed 99.9% of trades in less than one second, with an average execution speed of 0.03 seconds. We have established a set of standards we use to measure execution quality for FOREX.com, and we publish execution statistics on a monthly basis. The FOREX.com execution scorecard, which is available on our website, demonstrates our ability to provide fast, accurate trade executions, as well as our commitment to transparency in our business. We believe we are the only firm in our industry to voluntarily publish a monthly execution scorecard with the level of detail that we provide.
Efficient customer onboarding and account management
We have developed proprietary technology to handle numerous aspects of account onboarding and customer service including account opening and customer verification process, fast online account funding and withdrawals with a wide variety of automated payment methods, and on-demand delivery of customer information, such as account statements and other account-related reporting. We also offer account opening and funding functions on our mobile trading applications in order to provide a superior experience to the large number of customers who trade primarily through their mobile devices. Given the highly regulated and global nature of our business, these processes are customized to each regulatory jurisdiction in which we operate, and are further tailored to customer needs and preferences in specific countries in order to make it easier for clients in these countries to open accounts with us and then to fund and trade in those accounts. 
Sophisticated risk management
Because we are exposed to market, credit and other risks in connection with our retail business, developing and maintaining robust risk management capabilities is a high priority.
We allow our customers to trade notional amounts greater than the funds they have on deposit with us through the use of leverage, making management of credit risk a key focus for us. We manage customer credit risk through a combination of providing trading tools that allow our customers' to avoid taking on excessive risk and automated processes that close customer positions in accordance with our policies, in the event the funds in customers' accounts are not sufficient to hold their positions. One such tool available on our trading platforms is a real-time margin monitoring tool that enables customers to know when they are approaching their margin limits. If a customer’s equity falls below the amount required to support one or more positions, we will automatically liquidate positions to bring the customer’s account into margin compliance.
In addition, we actively monitor and assess various market factors, including volatility and liquidity, and take steps to address identified risks, such as proactively adjusting required customer margin (both initial and maintenance). For example, on January 15, 2015, the Swiss National Bank, or SNB, unexpectedly announced that it would move interest rates to -0.75% and abandon the 1.20 floor for EUR/CHF that it had previously maintained. The announcement led to extraordinary volatility in the Swiss franc, which negatively impacted many market participants. However, as part of our ordinary course risk management process, we had identified significant risk relating to EUR/CHF products and had increased client margin requirements to 5% well in advance of the SNB's move, which mitigated the risk of negative client equity in the event the price floor was abandoned.
With respect to market risk, when a retail customer executes a trade with us, the trade may be naturally hedged against an offsetting trade from another customer, hedged through an offsetting trade with one of our liquidity providers or may become part of our net exposure portfolio. For naturally hedged trades, we receive the entire bid/offer spread we offer our customers on the two offsetting transactions. For trades hedged with our liquidity providers, we earn the difference between the retail bid/offer spread we offer our customers and the wholesale bid/offer spread we receive from our liquidity providers. Customer

trades in our net exposure portfolio are managed pursuant to our risk-management policies and procedures, including risk limits established by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors, and we receive the net gains or losses generated through the management of our net exposure.
Our risk management policies and procedures have been developed to enable us to effectively manage our exposure to market risk, particularly in connection with the management of our net exposure. Our net exposure is evaluated continuously and is continuously rebalanced throughout the trading day, thereby minimizing the risk we will be adversely affected by changes in the market prices of the products we hold. This real-time rebalancing of our portfolio enables us to curtail risk and to be profitable in both up and down market scenarios.
Our risk management policies and procedures are established and reviewed regularly by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. Our risk-management team monitors risk exposure continuously and updates senior management both informally over the course of the trading day and formally through real-time, intraday and end-of-day reporting. We do not actively initiate proprietary market positions in anticipation of future movements in the relative prices of the products we offer.
Customers
Our retail customers consist primarily of self-directed traders, who execute trades on their own behalf. A small number of our customers have engaged an intermediary to make trading decisions on their behalf. 
Our typical self-directed customer is generally comfortable making trading decisions and is specifically interested in trading leveraged products, which generally have a higher risk/reward profile. For the year ended December 31, 2017, self-directed customers represented approximately 99.3% of our retail trading volume.
The intermediaries engaged by our managed account customers, which we refer to as authorized traders, include professional money managers, which trade aggregated customer funds, and individuals that trade for a small number of customer accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2017, managed account customers collectively represented approximately 0.7% of our retail trading volume.
Sales and Marketing
In connection with our retail business, we look to acquire new customers as cost-efficiently as possible, primarily through online marketing efforts such as advertising on third-party websites, search engine marketing and email marketing. Our experienced in-house marketing team creates highly targeted online campaigns tailored to experienced traders, as well as marketing programs and materials designed to support and educate newer traders. We use sophisticated tracking and measurement techniques to monitor the results of individual campaigns and continually work to optimize our overall marketing results.
One of our principal lead-generation tools is to offer prospective customers access to free registered practice trading accounts for a 30-day trial period. From a prospective customer’s point of view, we believe the registered practice trading account serves two important functions. First, it allows the prospective customer to evaluate our trading platform, tools and services. Second, for less experienced traders, it serves as an educational tool, providing the prospective customers with the opportunity to try trading in a risk-free environment, without committing any capital. During this trial period, our customer service team is available to assist and educate the prospective customers.
We also work with introducing brokers in order to expand our customer base. We work with a variety of different types of introducing brokers, ranging from small, specialized firms that specifically identify and solicit customers interested in forex and CFD trading, to larger, more established financial services firms. Introducing brokers direct customers to us in return for either a commission on each referred customer’s trading volume or a share of net revenue generated by each referred customer’s trading activity. In 2017 we began to roll out a global affiliate program pursuant to which third parties refer customer to us in exchange for a one-time payment. The affiliate program commenced in the United Kingdom and we intend to extend it to our other major markets.
Competition
The market for our retail services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Our competitors vary by region in terms of regulatory status, breadth of product offering, size and geographic scope of operations. Our main competitors during 2017 can be categorized as follows:
8


• | Regulated Forex Firm such as OANDA Corporation and FXCM. Like us, these firms have also expanded globally over the past several years, and we consider them to be competitors in several of our key markets. In February 2017, FXCM was required to cease offering its services in the United States by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and we acquired substantially all of the company's U.S.-domiciled customers. For more information, please refer to Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.


• | Global Multi-Asset Trading Firms, including firms such as Interactive Brokers, IG Group Holdings plc and CMC Group. These firms generally offer a broad set of asset classes and earn a significant percentage of their revenue from CFDs, forex and exchange-traded products.

Our Institutional Segment
Through our institutional segment, we provide a variety of services to institutional investors including electronic access to foreign exchange and precious metals via an ECN, agency execution services from our voice sales team through our registered swap dealer; trading on a registered swap execution facility and prime-of-prime services in collaboration with the retail segment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our institutional segment represented 9.8% of our net revenue.
In contrast to our retail segment, in our institutional segment, we act as agent between the principals to the transactions that are executed. We do not assume any market or credit risk, as we earn commissions or commission equivalents (markup/markdown) for our services. Our institutional segment also facilitates client orders through riskless principal trades.
Service Offerings
Through the ECN platform, which is branded under “GTX,” we provide deep liquidity in spot and forward foreign exchange and precious metals to buy-side and sell-side firms, including banks, brokers, hedge funds, Commodity Trading Advisors and asset managers. GTX’s centrally-cleared prime brokerage model supports true peer-to-peer trading capabilities and allows every GTX client to add market liquidity to the venue by posting real-time bids and offers, while also trading on other participants' bids and offers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net revenue from our ECN business was 74% of the net revenue of our institutional segment.
Our prime-of-prime business, which we refer to as our GTX Direct offering, allows experienced traders who meet certain qualifications, but do not have a credit line with a prime broker, access to trading on the GTX ECN. Through GTX Direct, our clients deposit collateral with us and we make trades through the GTX trading platform on our clients’ behalf, earning a commission for each trade.
The agency execution desk serves a broad range of participants across several asset classes, allowing clients to interact with the market based on their specific needs and preferences. Our agency execution business is currently positioned on as a compliment to our ECN offering, providing bespoke hands-on service for clients wishing to execute more complex or structured transactions.
Our swap execution facility, or SEF, offers electronic trading of non-deliverable forwards. We are in the process of on-boarding prime banks to serve as central clearing hubs to facilitate this business.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, net revenue from our agency execution business constituted 25% of the net revenue of our institutional segment.
GTX is powered by software and intellectual property that we first licensed on an exclusive basis in 2010. After undertaking significant development and enhancement efforts, we acquired full ownership of the software and intellectual property in July 2014.
Sales and Marketing
We have a direct sales team that is dedicated to building relationships with potential institutional customers and expanding our institutional business. Since its inception in 2010, our institutional business has expanded to include customers throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. 
9

Competition
In general, competition for business with institutional clients is based on a variety of factors, including technology, execution quality, client relationships, client service, cost and reputation.
GTX competes with other firms offering electronic trading platforms, such as Nex Group, formerly ICAP, through its EBS offering; Thomson Reuters; Currenex, owned by State Street Bank; Hotspot, a subsidiary of CBOE Holdings, Inc.; Integral Development Corp.; FastMatch Inc.; 360T Trading Networks; and others. 
Our Futures Segment
Our futures segment offers execution and related services for exchange-traded futures and futures options on major U.S. and European exchanges. We clear our customers’ trades through our regulated FCM, GAIN Capital Group, LLC (“GCGL”). In 2014, we expanded our futures business by acquiring a majority interest in Global Asset Advisors, LLC (“GAA”), a Chicago-based futures brokerage firm which principally markets to and services clients under the Daniels Trading (“DTR”) brand. GAA is an introducing broker targeting retail and professional traders, primarily in equities and agricultural products. At the same time, we also acquired a majority interest in Top Third Ag Marketing, LLC (“TT”), an introducing broker, which uses options-based hedging strategies to help clients manage the risks of agricultural production.
Revenue in our futures segment is primarily generated through commissions earned on futures and futures options trades. Our futures segment represented 12.3% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Advanced Trading Platform
Our futures segment provides customers an enhanced experience through our GAIN Trader proprietary trading platform. We have invested in high-speed connectivity to provide access to over 30 global electronic exchanges, which allows us to deliver streaming quotes and high-speed executions. The GAIN Trader platform has a robust suite of trading tools, including charting tools, custom alerts and indicators, as well as automated trading and risk management tools. Our futures segment also provides Trade Desk Manager, a version of our GAIN Trader platform offered to other introducing brokers, which allows them to manage their customers’ accounts. In addition, we facilitate connection to our trading services through APIs from other front-end applications, and we license a white label version of our GAIN Trader platform to select third parties.
Risk Management
In our futures segment, we are exposed to credit risk as it relates to customer positions. If an adverse market move occurs and triggers an additional margin requirement, we may be unable to collect the additional margin in a timely manner, or at all. In such a case, we would incur bad debt expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. To mitigate this risk, we monitor all client accounts in near real time using multiple tool and processes designed to ensure that our client accounts are trading within their means.
Sales and Marketing
As with our other segments, we seek to acquire futures customers as cost-efficiently as possible. Our principal source of new customers comes from a large network of introducing brokers, In addition, sales leads are generated through seminars, online advertising and other media. In addition to our marketing efforts, we attract our futures segment customers through dedicated sales staff at GCGL, GAA and TT. These sales teams focus on a variety of sectors and provide differentiated services to our customers. 
Competition
Our futures segment competes for both introducing-broker generated business and direct client business. For introducing brokers, our primary competitors are the limited number of FCMs that own and operate proprietary technology, including FC Stone, R.J. O’Brien, Rosenthal Collins Group, Interactive Brokers, and ADM Investor Services. 
The majority of our competitors for direct business are small, privately held firms like Allendale, Advance Trading, and Roach Ag Marketing; as well as larger firms such as Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade and E*Trade Financial Corporation.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions to protect our proprietary technology, intellectual property rights and our brands (e.g., FOREX.com, GAIN Capital, City Index and GTX). We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and 
10

consultants, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. We rigorously control access to our proprietary technology. Currently, we do not have any pending or issued patents.
We use a variety of service marks that have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including: GAIN Capital (registered service mark), FOREX.com GAIN Capital Group (registered service mark), Forex Insider (registered service mark), ForexTrader (registered service mark), FOREX.com (registered service mark), It’s Your World. Trade It. (registered service mark), GAIN Capital Futures (registered service mark), GAIN Futures, OEC (registered service mark). We also have registered trademarks covering our City Index brand name and logo in a variety of jurisdictions, including Australia, the United Kingdom, European Union, Singapore and China.
Regulation
Overview
Our business and industry are highly regulated. Our operating subsidiaries are regulated in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, the United Kingdom (through which we have accessed regulatory passport rights to operate in a number of European Economic Area jurisdictions), Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada, Singapore and the Cayman Islands. Government regulators and self-regulatory organizations oversee the conduct of our business in many ways, and several perform regular examinations to monitor our compliance with applicable statutes, regulations and rules. These statutes, regulations and rules cover all aspects of our business, including:

• | sales and marketing activities, including our interaction with, and solicitation of, customers;


• | trading practices, including the types of products and services we may offer;


• | the methods by which customers can fund accounts with us;


• | treatment of customer assets, including custody, control, safekeeping and, in certain countries, segregation of our customer funds and securities;


• | maintaining specified minimum amounts of capital and limiting withdrawals of funds from our regulated operating subsidiaries;


• | continuing education requirements for our employees;


• | anti-money laundering practices;


• | recordkeeping and reporting; and


• | supervision regarding the conduct of directors, officers and employees.

In some jurisdictions in which we offer our products and services, we are not subject to regulation as a result of the nature of the market or the manner in which we conduct our business. We consult with legal counsel in jurisdictions in which we operate on a regular basis as to whether we have the required authorizations, licenses or approvals or whether we may conduct our business cross-border with residents in that jurisdiction without obtaining local regulatory authorization, approval or consent. To the extent that we wish to serve customers in a jurisdiction in which we determine licensing or registration is required, we may also elect to direct such customers to a licensed white label or other partner, rather than pursuing licensing or registration ourselves.
Though we conduct our business in a manner which we believe complies with applicable local law, regulators may assert authority over activities that they deem to take place within the jurisdiction they regulate, and new laws, rules or regulations may be enacted that change the regulatory landscape and result in new, or clarify preexisting, registration or licensing requirements.
The primary responsibility for ensuring that we maintain compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements is vested in our legal and compliance departments. In addition, our legal and compliance departments are responsible for our ongoing training and education programs, supervision of our personnel required to be licensed by one or more of our regulators, review of sales, marketing and other communications and other related functions. In addition, our sales employees are licensed pursuant to applicable regulation.

U.S. Regulation
In the United States, the CFTC and the NFA regulate our forex and futures trading activities. Historically, the principal legislation covering our U.S. forex business was the Commodity Exchange Act, which provides for federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded on organized exchanges. In recent years, as in the case of other companies in the financial services industry, our forex business has been subject to increasing regulatory oversight. The CFTC Reauthorization Act, which grants the CFTC express authority to regulate the retail forex industry includes a series of rules which regulate various aspects of our business, including:

• | creating “retail foreign exchange dealers,” or RFEDs, a new regulated category of forex brokers focused on retail investors that are permitted to act as counterparty to retail forex transactions;


• | imposing an initial minimum security deposit amount between 2.0% and 5.0%, depending on the pair, of the notional value for retail forex transactions in “major currency” pairs and between 5.0% and 20%, depending on the pair, of the notional value for retail forex transactions in "non-major currency";


• | providing that introducing brokers, money managers and fund managers must either (i) register with the CFTC and become members of the NFA or apply for an exemption from registration and (ii) meet the minimum net capital requirements applicable to futures and commodity options introducing brokers or enter into a guarantee agreement with a CFTC-regulated forex dealer member and permitting only one such guarantee agreement per introducing broker;


• | requiring that a risk disclosure statement be provided to every retail forex customer, including disclosure of the number of profitable and unprofitable non-discretionary accounts maintained by the forex broker during the four most recent calendar quarters; and


• | prohibiting RFEDs, FCMs and introducing brokers from including statements in sales and marketing materials that would appear to convey to potential retail forex customers that there is a guaranty against loss, and requiring that FCMs, RFEDs and introducing brokers provide retail forex customers with enhanced written disclosure statements that, among other things, inform customers of the risk of loss; and

In July 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act. A number of significant provisions contained in the law affect or will affect once implementing regulations are adopted by the appropriate federal agencies, our business. Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act includes:

• | rules that, beginning in October 2010, require us to ensure that our customers residing in the United States have accounts open only with our NFA-member operating entity, GCGL;


• | amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act that, beginning on July 15, 2011, required essentially all retail transactions in any commodity other than foreign currency to be executed on an exchange, rather than OTC;


• | a requirement that federal banking regulators adopt new rules regarding the conduct and operation of retail forex businesses by banks; and


• | a requirement that the SEC adopt rules regarding the conduct and operation of retail forex businesses by broker-dealers.

The Dodd-Frank Act also provides for additional regulation of swaps and security-based swaps, including some types of foreign exchange and metals derivatives in which we engage. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the registration of swap dealers with the CFTC and imposes significant regulatory requirements on swap dealers and swap execution facilities. Effective February 27, 2013, GAIN GTX, LLC, ("GTX SEF") became provisionally registered with the CFTC and NFA as a swap dealer. Effective June 2016, GTX SEF, LLC became permanently registered with the CFTC as a swap execution facility, replacing the temporary registration previously granted in April 2014. The CFTC and NFA have adopted, and may adopt, new rules including those more recently adopted requiring Retail Foreign Exchange Dealers to provide greater transparency about the cost associated with their forex transactions; required notification to NFA for FCMs that decide to offer customers the ability to trade any virtual currency futures product and monthly risk data reporting requirements for Swap Dealers. Our operations in the U.S. are also subject to regulatory capital requirements that require various of our subsidiaries to maintain a minimum level of net capital relative to customer obligations. For more information, please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Regulatory Capital Requirements.”
U.S. Patriot Act and Anti-Money Laundering
Like other companies in the financial services industry, we are subject to a variety of statutory and regulatory requirements concerning our relationships with customers and the review and monitoring of their transactions. Specifically, we are subject to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the Patriot Act, which requires that we maintain a comprehensive anti-money laundering, or AML, program, a 
12

customer identification program, or CIP, designate an AML compliance officer, provide specified employee training and conduct an annual independent audit of our AML program. Consistent with the Patriot Act, our CIP includes both documentary and non-documentary review and analysis of potential customers. Under our CIP, we review each prospective customer’s identity internally and also contract with third-party firms that perform extensive background checks on each prospective customer, including through review of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets and Control, Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons lists. These procedures and tools, coupled with our periodic training, assist us in complying with the Patriot Act, as well as the CFTC’s and NFA’s applicable AML and CIP requirements. 
United Kingdom Regulation
GAIN Capital U.K., Ltd. (“GCUK2”), Trade Facts, Ltd. (“Trade Facts”) and GAIN Capital Payments Ltd. are registered in the U.K. and are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in respect of their trading activity. These U.K. Entities are required to comply with relevant U.K. and E.U. legislation and regulation. GAIN Capital-Forex.com U.K. Ltd. (“GCUK1”) was regulated until October 6, 2017 when its business operations were integrated into GCUK2 and its license was deregistered with the FCA. Please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Regulatory Capital Requirements” for a discussion of minimum regulatory capital requirements applicable to our U.K. businesses.
Client Money Rules
GCUK2 is subject to the FCA’s client money rules by virtue of being authorized by the FCA to hold client money. Under these rules, we are required to: 

• | maintain adequate segregation of client funds;


• | maintain adequate records in order to be able to meet future obligations when we hold client assets as collateral and be able to identify details of those assets to clients;


• | comply with custody rules when holding financial instruments (as defined by MiFID I) or other investments belonging to a client in the course of our business, including the safeguarding of those investments and holding all dividends and fees (e.g., stock lending fees) in accordance with the client money rules;


• | have adequate organizational arrangements in place to minimize the risk that client money may be paid for the account of a client whose money has not yet been received by us;


• | undertake daily internal and external client money reconciliations; and


• | appoint an individual who is responsible for Client Asset Sourcebook, or CASS, oversight.

Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions
As in the U.S., we are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements concerning our relationships with customers and the review and monitoring of their transactions. Specifically, the U.K. Entities are subject to ongoing customer due diligence, or CDD, obligations under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007, or MLR, and the FCA Handbook. 
The prescribed CDD measures require the U.K. Entities to (i) verify customer identity and understand the nature and purpose of the proposed relationship on the basis of documents, data or information obtained from a reliable and independent source and (ii) review and monitor their customer’s transactions and activities. The U.K. Entities are required to determine the extent of CDD measures required for each customer on a risk sensitive basis depending on the type of customer, business relationship, product or transaction and we must be able to demonstrate that such measures are appropriate in view of the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. Our procedures are based on the Joint Money Laundering Group’s Guidance for the U.K. Financial Sector, which provides guidance to firms for the determination of appropriate CDD measures. 
The FCA requires the U.K. Entities to have systems and controls in place to enable them to identify, assess, monitor and manage money laundering risk. Accordingly, we have the requisite systems and controls in place which are comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of our activities. We provide appropriate training to our employees in relation to money laundering and retain documentation of our risk management policies and risk profile in relation to money laundering. As required, we provide regular reports to our Money Laundering Reporting Officer, or MLRO, on the operation and effectiveness of these systems and controls, including details of our regular assessments of the adequacy of these systems and controls to ensure their compliance with FCA requirements.
Our systems and controls also include CDD and other measures to identify where customers and others with whom we transact may be subject to financial sanctions, including those initiated or adopted by the U.K. Treasury or the EU.

EMIR
The E.U. European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Regulation (EU) 648/2012), or EMIR, imposes requirements on entities that enter into any form of derivative contract, including foreign exchange derivatives, and applies directly to firms in the E.U. and indirectly to non-E.U. firms that trade with E.U. firms. Accordingly, the U.K. Entities need to:

• | report all derivative contracts and their lifecycle events (concluded, modified and terminated) to which we are a party to a trade repository either by ourselves or through a third party;


• | keep all records relating to concluding of derivative contracts and any subsequent modification for 5 years;


• | comply with the risk management requirements for OTC bilateral derivatives, including portfolio reconciliation, portfolio compression, record keeping, dispute resolution and margining (these requirements began to be phased in starting in September 2016); and


• | clear through central counterparties all OTC derivatives which will be subject to the mandatory clearing obligation.

Appropriateness assessments
Where firms offer “execution only” services for certain financial instruments which are deemed “complex”, E.U. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/39/EC), or MiFID I, requires firms to assess the appropriateness of those investments for retail clients. For this assessment, we are required to collect information about our existing and potential clients’ knowledge and experience with regard to specific products and services, including: 

• | the types of services, transactions and financial instruments with which the retail client is familiar;


• | the nature, volume, and frequency of the retail client’s transactions in financial instruments and the period over which they have been carried out; and


• | the level of education, and profession or relevant former profession of the retail client or potential retail client.

We are required to offer to a retail client or transact for them only those products that are deemed appropriate for their knowledge, experience and other circumstances. If the retail client demands a product that has been assessed as inappropriate for the retail client’s circumstances by us, we may either refuse to offer the product to the client, or allow them access to the product but we are required to give the retail client a warning that the product may be inappropriate to its circumstances. We are not required to undertake this analysis for professional clients as we are entitled to assume that a professional client has the necessary knowledge and experience in order to understand the risks involved in relation to the particular products or services for which he has been classified as a professional client. 
MiFID II
MiFID I applied in the U.K. from November 2007 but has been recast into a new directive, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (Directive 2014/65/EU), or MiFID II, and a new regulation, the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (Regulation 600/2014), or MiFIR. The changes implemented by MiFID II and MiFIR took effect on January 3, 2018.
MiFID II: 

• | expands the number of financial instruments for which firms are required to carry out an appropriateness assessment before providing an execution only service to retail clients;


• | extends the pre- and post-trade transparency regime to derivatives traded on regulated markets, multi-lateral trading facilities, or MTFs, and organized trading facilities, or OTFs;


• | expands transaction reporting to those financial instruments traded on MTFs, OTFs, and those financial instruments where the underlying instrument is traded on a Trading Venue; and


• | gives E.U. Member State regulators the new power to ban or restrict the marketing, distribution or sale of a financial instrument or types of financial practice where there is a threat to investor protection, the orderly functioning and integrity of markets or to financial stability. The European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority have similar powers to impose a ban on an EU-wide basis or in relation to a particular E.U. Member State.

Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs) 
Regulation 1286/486 on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products, or the PRIIPs Regulation, took effect in the U.K. from January 1, 2018, reflecting a delay from the original implementation date of December 31, 2016. U.K. Entities now need to comply with the new regime set out in the PRIIPs Regulation in relation to 
14

PRIIPS that they manufacture, advise on or sell to retail clients. The FCA regards derivatives (including options, futures, and contracts for differences) as falling within the definition of a PRIIP. The new regime requires us to provide retail clients with a standardized key information document, or KID, in good time before any transaction in derivatives is concluded or for transactions concluded by distance communications, after the transaction has taken place, but only if it is not possible to provide the KID in advance and the client consents. 
ESMA’s Consultation Paper: ESMA35-43-904
In January 2018, the European Securities and Markets Association, or ESMA, issued a consultation paper, referred to as ESMA35-43-904. In this paper, ESMA states that it is considering the possible use of its product intervention powers under Article 40 of MiFIR to address investor protection concerning the marketing, distribution and sale of CFDs and binary options to retail investors. These proposals include the use of enhanced risk disclosures, restrictions upon the offering of promotional incentives to clients, mandatory margin close-out levels for retail clients and varying limitations on the opening leverage that may be offered to clients; including an overall cap of 30 to 1 leverage for major currency pairs and lower leverage levels for other asset classes. The comment period for ESMA’s consultation expired in February 2018 and we cannot currently predict which, if any, of the proposed changes will be implemented. The FCA have indicated that any U.K. policy measures covering similar topics would take in to account such ESMA measures once finalized.
