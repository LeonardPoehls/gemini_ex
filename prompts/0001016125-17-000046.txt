Item 1. Business
Overview
Ultimate Software is a leading cloud provider of people management solutions, often referred to as human capital management (“HCM”). Ultimate's UltiPro product suite (“UltiPro”) is a comprehensive, engaging solution that has human resources ("HR"), payroll, and benefits management at its core and includes global people management, available in 14 languages with more than 35 country-specific localizations. The solution is delivered via software-as-a-service ("SaaS") to organizations based in the United States and Canada, including those with global workforces. At the close of 2016, we had approximately 3,700 organizations as customers and approximately 33 million people records in our HCM cloud. We attained our leadership position, we believe, through our focus on unified HCM, people-centric product design, cloud technology, and strong customer relationships.
UltiPro is designed to deliver the functionality businesses need to manage the complete employee life cycle from recruitment to retirement and to facilitate employee engagement with their employers and each other. The solution includes unified feature sets for talent acquisition and onboarding, HR management and compliance, benefits management and online enrollment, payroll, performance management, employee engagement surveying, compensation management with salary planning, budgeting, and development of incentive plans, succession management, learning management, reporting and analytical decision-making and predictive tools, and time and attendance. UltiPro has role-based features for HR professionals, executives, managers, administrators, and employees whether they are in or out of the office, including access to business-critical information on mobile devices such as the iPhone, iPad, and other smartphones and tablets.
Our customers tell us that UltiPro helps them to streamline talent management, HR and payroll processes to significantly reduce administrative and operational costs while also empowering them to manage the talent in their workforces more strategically. UltiPro provides our customers tools to analyze workforce trends for better decision making, identify high-performing talent within their organizations, predict who high-performers will be with a high degree of accuracy, find critical information quickly and perform routine business activities efficiently.
Our cloud offering of UltiPro provides Web-based access to comprehensive HCM functionality for organizations that want to simplify delivery and support of their business applications. We have found that UltiPro is attractive to companies that want to focus on their core competencies to increase sales and profits while we, through UltiPro, supply and manage the hardware, infrastructure, ongoing maintenance and backup services for our customers. 
We market our UltiPro solutions primarily to enterprise companies, which we define as organizations with 2,501 or more employees, including those with 10,000 or more employees; mid-market companies, which we define as those having 501-2,500 employees; and strategic market companies, which we define as those having 100-500 employees. Our mid-market and strategic customers have access to nearly all the features that our larger enterprise companies have through UltiPro, plus a bundled services package. Since many companies in the mid- and strategic markets do not have information technology (“IT”) staff on th
2

eir premises to help with system deployment or ongoing management issues, we have created a bundled services package to give these customers a high degree of convenience by handling system configuration, business rules, and other situations for them “behind the scenes.” UltiPro is marketed primarily through our enterprise, mid-market, and strategic direct sales teams.
Cloud Computing Model
Cloud computing is the current terminology for describing the delivery of SaaS. Market acceptance of cloud computing for mission critical enterprise applications has become increasingly common in recent years since software can be delivered cost-effectively, reliably, and securely to businesses over the Internet without the need for customers to purchase supporting software and hardware for an on-premise system or the need to keep IT people on staff to monitor and upgrade such a system.
We introduced our first subscription-based service solution over the Internet in December of 2000, and we began marketing our first multi-tenant SaaS HCM to enterprise companies in 2002. Since that time, we have significantly expanded our HCM offerings and enhanced our foundational technologies. Today, we develop our solutions using the latest advances in cloud computing and provide our customers with solutions that are highly functional, easy to use, configurable, and fast. Our cloud model is based on a multi-tenant architecture that is both open and secure with support for user experiences on both desktop and mobile devices. Our customers that have moved away from traditional on-premise software to our cloud-based service applications benefit by substantially reducing the cost and complexity typical of on-premise software implementations, customizations, and upgrades. Through cloud computing, we supply and manage the hardware, infrastructure, ongoing maintenance, and backup services for our customers. We install the latest version of our software for our customers, thereby reducing their need to buy and maintain their own IT resources. As a part of our cloud model, we also provide activation and training services to our customers as well as support services.
We provide our hardware, infrastructure, ongoing maintenance and backup services at four data centers: one located near Atlanta, Georgia, one near Phoenix, Arizona, one near Toronto, Canada, and the fourth near Vancouver, Canada. Our data center facilities are owned and operated by independent third parties, who provide redundant power, bandwidth, and physical security. Ultimate employees deploy, monitor, and manage our hardware and software systems in accordance with our security and data privacy policies, which are subject to examination by an independent third-party.
Market Share
Based on our customer counts and market data from Hoover's/Dun & Bradstreet as of January 3, 2017, we estimate our approximate share of the total available market (TAM) at the close of 2016 to be 7 percent for enterprise companies, 9 percent for mid-market companies, and 1 percent for companies in the strategic market. 
Company Information

During February 2015, Ultimate formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, The Ultimate Software Group of Asia, PTE. LTD. There were no material assets or revenues in Canada or Singapore as of or for the year ended December 31, 2016. Ultimate's headquarters is located at 2000 Ultimate Way, Weston, Florida 33326 and our telephone number is (954) 331-7000. 
Capabilities of UltiPro
UltiPro is a comprehensive cloud-based solution designed to deliver the functionality businesses need to manage the complete employee life cycle from recruitment to retirement, and to facilitate employee engagement with their employers and each other. The solution includes feature sets for talent acquisition and onboarding, HR management and compliance, benefits management and online enrollment, payroll, performance management, employee engagement surveying, compensation management, succession management, learning management, reporting and analytical decision-making tools, time and attendance, and role-based self-service capabilities for executives, managers, administrators, and employees whether they are in or out of the office. UltiPro offers the following capabilities to our customers:
Role-Based Internet Access to Functionality. UltiPro provides Web access to workforce-related business functions, company communications, and reporting for everyone in our customer's organization, not just the HR department. The access and specific functionality can be tailored to our customer's process requirements and the individual user's role. We believe that UltiPro's employee-facing Web applications can increase management and administrative efficiencies by providing immediate access to reporting, staff management processes and business intelligence for business leaders, and can reduce operating costs 
3

by eliminating the need for organizations to print and distribute paper communications, handbooks, forms, and paychecks. Ultimate also provides UltiPro functionality for use on mobile devices. Using tablets or smartphones, employees can manage their goals, provide feedback to managers, search and apply for career opportunities, access their own personal information, such as pay statements, and view their company's employee directory to look up contact information or employee photos. In addition, managers can approve or deny daily workflow transactions, such as salary changes and paid time off, access reports and analytics, and readily review goals, competencies, and accomplishments of their team members. 
Rich and Highly Configurable Functionality. UltiPro has rich functionality built into the solution and provides extensive capabilities for configurability. As a result, we have found that our customers can avoid extensive customizations and yet are able to achieve a highly tailored solution to meet their specific business needs. Since UltiPro's feature-sets are unified, our customers are able to streamline their management of the total employment cycle and can generate strategic HR and talent management reports from UltiPro as their primary, central system of record for their employee data.
Flexible, Rapid System Setup and Configuration. UltiPro has been designed to minimize the time and effort required to set up and configure the system to address individual company needs. Largely because our UltiPro solutions deliver extensive functionality that can be configured to align with our customers' various business models with few customizations, our setup of new customers is faster and simpler than implementations typical of legacy, on-premise software. 
Reduced Total Cost of Ownership. We believe that the UltiPro solution provides cost saving opportunities for our customers and that UltiPro is competitively priced. In addition, we believe that our current practices in activating the UltiPro solution result in cost savings for customers when compared with implementations of other similar solutions in the industry. The UltiPro customer may also reduce the administrative and IT support costs associated with the organization's HR, benefits and payroll functions over time. Administrative costs can be further reduced by providing an organization with greater access to information, streamlined HR processes and transactions, and control over reporting.
Modern Cloud Technologies. We have consistently focused on identifying leading technologies and practices and integrating them into our products. The primary characteristics of our technology and cloud architecture are:

• | Multi-tenant model (multiple instances of UltiPro for different organizations can reside on one server) that allows each application component to run on a separate farm, or cluster, of load-balanced servers while still providing customer data security and segregation.


• | Configurability that enables customers to achieve a highly tailored UltiPro experience for their businesses without incurring the high expense of custom software.


• | Web services, with a focus on micro-services (a set of platform-neutral and vendor-independent protocols that enable application interactions over the Internet using Extensible Markup Language, or XML, and other Web technologies) that enable UltiPro customers to connect with other applications and data services easily and securely.


• | Domain-driven, user-centered design framework that leverages industry-leading tools and technologies, including, but not limited to, Microsoft's .NET platform, Openstack, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS, and Docker to streamline the complexities of our HCM domain and focus on how our users want to use UltiPro rather than expect them to change their behavior to accommodate our product.


• | HTML-5 framework and responsive Web design for mobile-centric computing that enables a rich, dynamic user experience for UltiPro users on the smartphones or tablets of their choice.

Rich End-User Experience, Ease of Use and Navigation. We design our products to be user-friendly and to simplify the complexities of managing employees and complying with government regulations in the HR, payroll, and talent management areas. UltiPro uses familiar, consumer-style navigation, which we believe makes our solution convenient and easy to use. While traveling or out of the office, our customer's HR professionals, executives, managers, administrators, and employees can manage payroll and employee functions and run reports by accessing UltiPro over the Internet or find answers to key routine questions by using an UltiPro application on their mobile devices.
Comprehensive Customer Services and Industry-Specific Expertise. We provide several types of customer service: cloud services, professional setup and activation services, customer support services, knowledge (or training) services, and a group of optional service offerings we call Select Services that includes payment services (such as tax filing, garnishment management and check printing), ongoing managed services, and other specific-need services such as filing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("ACA") compliance documents for customers. The voice of our customers is incorporated into all of our processes, and all of our services are designed to create a positive, proactive and productive UltiPro experience for our customers. We have multiple avenues for our customers to give us feedback and recommendations on product enhancements, and we provide our customers a portal where they can choose to learn about UltiPro and Ultimate in the style that best suits them - online webinars, videos, instructional documents, online chats, customer communities, and other vehicles.

We recognize the importance of issuing timely updates that reflect changes in tax and other regulatory laws and employ a dedicated research team to track jurisdictional tax changes for more than 10,000 active tax codes included in UltiPro as well as changes in other employee-related regulations.
Managed Services. As part of our mission to simplify the work lives of our customers’ human resources and payroll people, we introduced UltiPro Managed Services in the fourth quarter of 2013 as a result of our acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Accel HR, LLC ("Accel HR"). These managed services are now part of our Select Services offerings and are designed for those customers who want to outsource some components of their HR, payroll, benefits, and HCM technology management functions without sacrificing the control of, or access to, their employee data that they enjoy with our cloud solution. Unlike other outsourced payroll or Human Resources Information System ("HRIS") services that typically take a one-size-fits-all approach, our customers can select from a variety of payroll management, HRIS, and/or benefits management services and combine them into a tailored bundle that best suits their unique needs.
UltiPro Standard Functionality and Optional Capabilities
UltiPro's standard functionality includes, but is not limited to, a set of role-based features that engage employees while allowing HR generalists as well as benefits, compensation, and payroll managers and other business managers to develop, coach, evaluate and reward their people and meet organizational objectives. Business intelligence along with system configuration tools and integration capabilities support our customers' connections with third-party applications and providers. UltiPro also includes employee relations tools for managing disciplinary actions and grievances, and health and safety incidents.
In addition to UltiPro's HCM functionality, our customers have the option to purchase a number of additional capabilities on a per-employee-per-month (“PEPM”) basis, which are available to enhance and complement the core functionality of UltiPro and which are based on the particular business needs of our customers. These optional UltiPro capabilities currently include (i) the talent acquisition suite (recruitment and onboarding); (ii) the talent management suite (performance management, talent predictors, and succession management); (iii) learning management; (iv) employee engagement surveys; (v) compensation management; (vi) benefits enrollment; (vii) time management; (viii) payment services (formerly referred to as “tax filing”); (ix) wage attachments; and (x) other optional features (collectively, “Optional Capabilities”), which are described below.
Differences between capabilities available to our enterprise, mid-market and strategic customers are specified below. Unless otherwise specified, capabilities are included in both our enterprise and mid-market offerings.
UltiPro's Standard HR/Payroll Functionality
UltiPro can act as the gateway to business activities for a company's executives, management team, HR/payroll staff, administrators, and employees. Employees of customers can access UltiPro from standard Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, view information and perform tasks in a language of their individual choice (most commonly English, Spanish, or French), set their personal preferences for the order and placement of home-page content, and set up access to any available page in one click. Ultimate believes that UltiPro allows our customers to improve service to their employees through better communications and to save time because managers and administrators can complete hundreds of common employee-related tasks, including administering benefits, managing staff and accessing reporting and business intelligence in real time, from one central solution. UltiPro also enables companies to provide secure, on-demand access to company and personal information for their employees over the Internet.
UltiPro's Standard HR/payroll functionality includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Human Resources Management. UltiPro manages all aspects of a person and their employment relationship regardless of where the employee resides. This includes personal details, skills and competencies, international identification documents, employment history, employment contracts (for those employees in countries that require them), performance, job and salary information, career development and preferences, and health and wellness programs. This allows single country or multinational organizations to easily manage and report on worldwide headcounts, and other critical business metrics. In addition, UltiPro facilitates the recording and tracking of key information for government compliance and reporting in the US, Canada and many other countries. This includes the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA), regulations implemented by the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), workers' compensation regulations, the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the ACA, and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws for the United States. UltiPro also enables compliance with HIPPAA confidentiality requirements for protecting sensitive data such as employee social security numbers. 
5

Benefits Management. UltiPro allows companies to automate the matching of health, welfare, dental, vision, and other benefits they offer their employees, including configuration and administration of benefit plans and employee and employer contributions. UltiPro also enables employees to check benefit options and coverage online. UltiPro eliminates the need for duplicate rules, duplicate data entry, and reconciliation reporting because it stores details for deductions and benefit plans in one common table. These features include rules for coverage, premium and employer match computations, and eligibility and participation determinations. UltiPro also allows companies to maintain and administer paid time off benefits, such as vacation (including calculating benefit accrual amounts), track leave-time taken, and facilitate the response to employee leave requests.
Payroll. UltiPro's payroll features a powerful engine that handles hundreds of payroll-related computations intended to minimize the customer's need for side calculations or additional programming. For example, UltiPro delivers complex wage calculations such as average pay rates for overtime calculations, shift premiums, garnishments and levy calculations. With UltiPro, a company's central payroll department, remote offices or multiple divisions can process payroll and can define and report on who completes each specific processing step based on the exact needs of the organization, thus supporting appropriate separation of duties. All of this is managed through an easy-to-use dashboard of payroll tasks and statuses. To help our customers reduce the complexities and errors associated with administrators manually assigning appropriate payroll taxes to employees in the United States, Ultimate offers an embedded feature called Smart Tax Search™. Smart Tax Search™ leverages the latest GIS (geographic information systems) technology to enable UltiPro to automatically assign the correct federal, state, and local payroll taxation rules based upon the home and work addresses listed in UltiPro’s employee records.
Tablet-Based Time clock. UltiPro TouchBase, which was introduced in connection with our acquisition of Employtouch (the "Employtouch Acquisition"), provides our customers an interactive mobile time clock device that collects time punches, as well as highlights the information most critical to employees and managers via an engaging activity stream. With UltiPro TouchBase, our customers can capture employee time on a touchscreen tablet device, collecting employee-validated data for cost accounting and payroll; can leverage photos for accurate capture of employee time-entry, avoiding 'buddy punches'; and can validate transactions using PIN (Personal Identification Number) entry, HID (Human Interface Device), RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), magnetic swipe or barcode. 
Role-Based Self-Service. Authorized managers have self-service access to staff information such as salary, compensation history, key dates and emergency contacts, with reporting and workforce analysis tools to facilitate decision-making. A customer's managers can view and update staff information, manage department activities, post job openings, leverage recruiting and hiring tools, and perform queries on workforce data. UltiPro's document management features can be used to house and categorize employee-related documents such as drivers' licenses, consent forms, and completed I-9 forms with required identification. Administrators, managers and employees have the ability to attach files in standard formats such as Microsoft Word, PDF, JPEG, and spreadsheets to employee files. The documents can be grouped and sorted to individual requirements, as necessary.
Employees also may be given immediate, security-protected access to view their own pay details on a mobile device or the Web, and benefits summaries, frequently used forms, and company information on the Web. They can also update personal information such as address, phone number, emergency contacts, and skills; change their preferences such as direct deposit accounts and benefits selections; make routine requests such as asking for vacation time; and enroll in training.
UltiPro Business Intelligence. UltiPro Business Intelligence uses a business intelligence platform from IBM Cognos Corporation, a third-party provider, for HR, payroll, and talent management reporting and analysis. Accessed via the Web, UltiPro Business Intelligence gives users the ability to access data across the UltiPro solution - from HR, payroll to benefits administration and enrollment, compensation, talent acquisition and onboarding, talent management, compensation, compliance, year-end data, and more - and enables them to create, modify, and distribute workforce-related reports and notifications. UltiPro includes a pre-configured data mapping library and pre-authored reports and analytics. Controlled by role-based security, everyone in a customer's organization—from line managers to executives can have immediate access to key workforce metrics, and they can personalize their own user experience to show the reports they want to see and how they want to see them. We believe that UltiPro Business Intelligence gives our customers significant strategic value for managing their workforce-related functions and saves them labor time and money by eliminating or reducing the need for internal technology people to generate hundreds of individual reports for disparate executive and management needs. UltiPro Business Intelligence is available to manager roles on a mobile device or tablet via UltiPro Mobile to provide quick access to mobile optimized reports and analytics. We also embed key data visualizations in context of the application. These data visualizations are developed as part of the core application and provide in-context support to decision-makers.
Other Key Capabilities. UltiPro's tracking of hours worked in payroll ties to UltiPro's benefits management, enabling automatic calculation of employees' hours of service eligibility and providing HR leaders analytical insight into compliance risk related to the ACA delivered in the Healthcare Eligibility Dashboard and via our UltiPro ACA Toolkit. UltiPro includes system configuration tools such as graphical workflow configuration and platform configuration to allow customers to extend UltiPro 
6

with new secure, reportable fields. In addition, UltiPro offers role-based security, flexible business rules, and an easy-to-use content management tool. Conditional workflow enables organizations to authorize HR/payroll staff, managers, or supervisors to manage key HR processes via UltiPro, expediting business activities such as hiring an employee or making a salary increase. UltiPro workflow is configurable based on customer need and includes numerous pre-configured processes based on industry best-practices. System administration is designed to enable non-technical users to administer UltiPro's role-based security, built-in conditional workflow, and system business rules, as well as to enable system administrators to post company communications, link to external Web sites and tailor functionality to reflect the customer's own company user experience requirements. Enterprise Integration Tools also are included to provide the ability to interface with third-party cloud and on-premise applications and providers such as general ledger, payment services, time clocks, banks, 401(k) and benefits providers, check printing services and unemployment management services.
UltiPro Predictors. The UltiPro predictive analytics solution is a key part of the core UltiPro suite where predictive metrics and indicators are available to support manager decisions. The predictors are based on statistical algorithms we developed over the course of more than two years and validated with numerous customers. UltiPro’s predictive metrics help managers to determine the best actions to take for further developing or changing the career trajectory of employees reporting to them, thereby helping organizations to reduce turnover and improve employee engagement. For example, organizations can set tolerances for certain predictive metrics in our UltiPro Retention Predictor™, giving a manager or HR generalist the ability to see immediately if an employee exceeds the tolerance level they have defined as "risk of leaving" and, thereby, providing them an early warning to take an appropriate action to increase the chances of that employee staying. In addition to our UltiPro Retention Predictor, the solution includes an UltiPro High Performer Indicator™, which identifies employees who consistently receive high pay raises, and an UltiPro High Performer Predictor™, which ranks employees predicted to be high performers based upon a number of variables tracked in UltiPro, and the UltiPro Engagement Indicator which provides insight into an employee’s level of engagement at their organization. To assist managers in creating actions to increase the engagement and retention of team members, UltiPro includes a section called Leadership Actions, based on best practices in talent management, to serve as optional methods for following up.
UltiPro's Optional Capabilities
UltiPro Talent Acquisition is a suite of add-on products comprised of Recruitment and Onboarding.
i) Recruiting. The Ultimate team designed our recruiting solution to transform the recruiting process by increasing candidate engagement and simplifying the work of recruiters. Built to be candidate-centric, UltiPro Recruiting has a consumer-like interface to attract and keep top talent engaged, with the goal to reduce the typical 40 percent to 80 percent online application drop-off rate typically occurring with traditional applicant tracking solutions. Rather than being restricted to limited profile information and résumés typical of traditional solutions, candidates can build an in-depth online presence that gives recruiters and hiring managers a more complete understanding of who they are. UltiPro Recruiting includes an appealing user interface, gamification, and collaboration tools. It is fully mobile and integrates with popular social networks such as LinkedIn and Twitter. At the same time, UltiPro Recruiting automates the recruiting process for hiring managers, recruiters, and HR staff by enabling them to track and manage standard recruitment tasks such as posting open jobs, reviewing résumés, screening candidates, and scheduling interviews.
ii) Onboarding. UltiPro Onboarding is a comprehensive solution that provides employers the ability to engage and welcome new employees into an organization before the first day of work and to speed their time to productivity. UltiPro Onboarding enables dynamic content such as video messages from executives, managers, and co-workers and gives new hires the ability to connect with fellow team members, request a mentor, engage in self-directed learning through a feature called ‘Unlock Your Potential,’ and complete compliance and other required documents. The solution is easily configurable to meet the specific needs of an organization and includes such activities as obtaining required government and procedural paperwork, including electronic signatures and document storage; provisioning necessary equipment and job-specific tools such as office location, computer equipment, and uniforms; ensuring enrollment in necessary training programs; and instilling the employer's core values and business objectives.
UltiPro Talent Management is a suite of add-on products comprised of Performance Management, Talent Predictors, and Succession Management.
i) Performance Management. UltiPro Performance Management helps companies maximize the development of their people and improve employee satisfaction by automating and enhancing the performance process, using competency-based employee development. UltiPro Performance Management streamlines the processes of evaluating performance and completing performance reviews, making competency assessments, identifying top performers for 
7

succession planning, and tracking and executing coaching, training and development plans. The solution also supports a continuous process of capturing real-time employee feedback from a social network and, through our mobile solution, makes goal management, talent profile information, employee observations, and goal journaling convenient for employees.
ii) Succession Management. With UltiPro Succession Management, organizations can involve company leadership, managers, and individuals in an ongoing, collaborative process of succession planning. Employees can manage their own talent profiles-updating factors that influence succession readiness such as mobility preferences, languages, education, accomplishments, and competencies-to ensure that leadership has a deeper understanding of the talent landscape at their organization. Visible to employees and managers, UltiPro's employee “talent card” provides a consolidated and comparative view of multiple succession-readiness factors, which then can be used in both decision-making and career development processes.
Other Optional Capabilities include, but are not limited to, the following products, which are supplemental to UltiPro's standard HR/payroll capabilities:
UltiPro Learning. Through a strategic partnership, Ultimate has the right to market and distribute an independent third party's learning management product as part of the UltiPro solution. We have branded this product UltiPro Learning. Ultimate is the single-source contact for customer implementations and ongoing solution support for UltiPro Learning. It is both Web-based and mobile and is integrated with UltiPro's HR and talent management functionality. UltiPro Learning is a new approach to learning that supports the collaborative and on-demand nature of learning demanded by employees today. UltiPro Learning allows organizations to create, curate, and deliver learning content to employees to meet their professional and personal learning needs. Customers can also create learning academies to meet specific organizational needs.
UltiPro Perception. UltiPro Perception was introduced as part of the acquisition made in the third quarter of 2016 of Kanjoya, Inc. ("Kanjoya"), a California corporation (the “Kanjoya Acquisition”), located in San Francisco, California. UltiPro Perception offers a modern way to collect and understand feedback through employee surveys and in-depth analytics of that data for HR and managers. The solution enables organizations to solicit feedback from employees in both structured and unstructured forms. Using the power of the ingrained Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine, UltiPro Perception analyzes feedback in a variety of ways, providing leaders a deeper understanding of employee sentiment while safeguarding employee privacy and anonymity. The built-in analytics allow everyone from HR and company executives to individual managers to view and gain a deeper insight into employee sentiments, identify employee feedback trends, and compare team results. These insights provide the basis for organizations to take appropriate action tailored to the needs of both teams and leaders, with the objective to improve engagement, satisfaction, and retention.
Compensation Management. UltiPro Compensation Management includes Salary Planning, Salary Budgeting and Incentive Compensation Plans capabilities. This expanded solution is designed to support executives, managers and compensation analysts working with salary increase allocations and to incentivize employees by giving them visibility into their individual compensation plans. Highly configurable, including multi-currency and pro-ration capabilities, UltiPro Compensation Management makes it easy for companies to manage their unique compensation plans and salary award processes with flat amounts, percentages and unit-based compensation such as restricted stock unit awards. Managers can review their salary budgets and merit pool guidelines and determine the best way to allocate pay increases to their employees within their approved budget parameters. Once managers decide on the allocations, they submit pay increases through UltiPro Payroll.
Benefits Enrollment. With UltiPro Benefits Enrollment, employees can enroll in the appropriate benefit plans for their individual needs online, either at work or from home, during defined open enrollment periods. Employees can also choose to quickly renew their benefits in a single click and are guided to make the right selections based on prerequisites that link benefit plans together. UltiPro mobile capabilities enable employees to update their retirement contributions on the go. Benefits administrators can configure the enrollment process and messaging to make the process easy for employees and can monitor the enrollment progress. UltiPro Benefits Enrollment also guides employees through the benefit and personal information changes necessary as a result of life events such as getting married, having a baby or moving. UltiPro also delivers more than 70 predefined Benefit Carrier templates to facilitate the electronic feeds required for insurance carriers and plan administrators, reducing the need for manual reporting of employee census information, participant coverage, and billing reconciliation.
Time, Attendance, and Scheduling (designed for enterprise companies). Through a strategic partnership, we have the right to market and distribute an independent third party's time and labor management product as part of the UltiPro solution. We have branded this product as UltiPro Time and Attendance, marketing the components as UltiPro Time and Attendance, UltiPro Leave Management, and UltiPro Workforce Scheduling (collectively, “UTA”). Ultimate is the single-source contact for customer implementations and ongoing solution support for UTA. UTA is Web-based and integrated with UltiPro's payroll, HR, 
8

and benefits functionality. UltiPro Time and Attendance tracks time and attendance labor metrics and supports a variety of time-capture mechanisms. UltiPro Leave Management includes all of the functionality required to effectively track and manage employee leave. UltiPro Workforce Scheduling features industry-specific employee scheduling options to ensure that organizations in different environments deploy employees in an efficient and legislatively compliant manner.
Time Management (designed for mid-market and strategic companies). UltiPro Time Management delivers the functionality and flexibility needed to manage employee time and attendance efficiently and provides Web access to real-time employee time and labor information. UltiPro Time Management provides companies with the tools to proactively prevent issues that negatively impact business performance, such as employee coverage gaps, labor law violations, and excess labor spending. Fully integrated scheduling, time and attendance, and leave management capabilities reduce payroll expenditures and streamline payroll and workforce management processes.
Payment Services. We have the right to market and distribute an independent third party's tax filing solution that we have branded UltiPro Payment Services (“UltiPro Payment Services”). With this solution, companies are able to meet all Federal, state, and local payroll tax filing obligations quickly and easily. The UltiPro solution saves payroll staff time by eliminating the administrative burdens associated with tax filing. UltiPro Payment Services enables businesses to deposit federal, state, and local tax payments for more than 10,000 active tax codes via electronic funds transfer or check and automates filing for monthly, quarterly, and annual tax returns.
Wage Attachments. For organizations required to process third-party payments on behalf of their employees for items such as child support, tax levies, and creditor garnishments, UltiPro Wage Attachments provides the means to effectively streamline and manage the payment process. UltiPro Wage Attachments eliminates the burden associated with payments to third parties by using information entered and calculated in UltiPro, so there is no need to manage payment processing or analyze varying disbursement schedules for multiple jurisdictions. We ensure that each third-party payment is made according to the designated payment method and reaches its required destination within the assigned timeframe. 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Compliance. In the fall of 2015, Ultimate began deploying an ACA Toolkit that enables our customers to comply with ACA regulations by the 2016 deadline. The toolkit is embedded in UltiPro and automatically populates the Forms 1094-C and 1095-C with the appropriate information. In addition, Ultimate offers our customers additional optional ACA-related services branded UltiPro ACA Employer Services. These include such services as printing and electronic filing of 1094-C and 1095-C forms with the IRS on our customer’s behalf and ongoing proactive monitoring and managing of employee eligibility alerts, notices, and penalty responses.
Other Optional Capabilities. We offer a number of additional HR and payroll-related services to extend the value of UltiPro, including test environment services, W-2 print services, pre-employment screening, paycheck modeling, pay cards, unemployment tax management, employment verification services, employee assistance, health and wellness, and work/life balance programs. In addition, we offer UltiPro Federated Single Sign-On for standards-based identity management by leveraging Microsoft's Active Directory Federated Services infrastructure as well as single-sign-on capabilities through our partner Ping Identity. These solutions help improve and simplify data security by enabling individuals to use a single login credential (such as a network login) to seamlessly access UltiPro over the Internet.
Technology 
We strive to use the most modern and capable technologies available for delivering solutions that are flexible, easy to use, fast, and secure. Major characteristics of our cloud application platform include, but are not limited to, the following:
Multi-tenancy. As a SaaS provider, we use a multi-tenant cloud model that allows us to support multiple customers on a single set of systems while maintaining performance, security, and reliability. We manage and maintain our solutions for our customers, including all hardware and software upgrades. Our customers benefit by reducing their need to keep their own IT resources on staff for UltiPro solutions. Our cloud customers also benefit from having the most current version of UltiPro installed as soon as it is available.
Configurability. We have invested in our own technology and approaches for enabling application and system configurability, giving our customers the ability to achieve a highly tailored solution while minimizing or eliminating the need to create custom code.
Openness and Connectivity. We leverage widely adopted technology and industry standards for exposing data and functionality via application programming interfaces (APIs). Customers can access their HCM data based on these standard, open, and secured connections in order to link to their in-house systems, third-party cloud applications, and other systems that require data feeds such as benefits providers. Our UltiPro Carrier Network (UCN) leverages industry-leading solutions from Informatica, allowing Ultimate to create standard, reusable connectors that support the unique data transfer requirements of i

ndividual benefits providers, simplifying both the development and maintenance of these connections. Ultimate also supports a number of pre-packaged connectors for solutions that expand or extend the functionality included in UltiPro. These packaged integrations include, but are not limited to: Yammer, a provider of enterprise social networking solutions; CERTPOINT, a provider of learning management solutions; and Ping Identity, which offers single-sign-on capabilities for business applications. 
Domain-Driven, User-Centered Design. Our solution design approach includes domain-driven design, which provides a streamlined process for developing software with the complexities of an HCM domain in alignment with the principles of a service-oriented architecture (SOA). A key focus of our user-centered design is to optimize the overall user experience of our customers and to maximize user engagement. We have invested significant resources in usability design and testing to create a consumer-grade experience that is flexible, responsive, and personalized. In the design of the user-experience, our emphasis is on how users want to use the product rather than the expectation that users will change their behavior to accommodate the product.
Mobile-Centric User Experience. In addition to the user experience capabilities available through Microsoft.NET, Ultimate uses Hypertext Markup Language version 5 (HTML5) and responsive Web design approaches to deliver flexible user experiences for smartphones and tablets. This mobile framework supports applications delivered through multiple browsers and automatically adapts to screen size and orientation and takes advantage of gesture-based capabilities. Other features of our mobile-centric user experience include search for both people data and functionality, configurability for individual users that allows them to drag and drop individual content 'gadgets' and menu controls, and favorite-specific functionality for quick access.
Workflow. Ultimate supports numerous transactions and operational processes for our customers. These processes are frequently unique to an individual customer and typically require multiple steps, approvals, data input, and confirmations. To support our customers' unique requirements, UltiPro includes configurable business process automation, or workflow, which enables customers to automate processes based on their own needs and change these processes over time without custom software code. 
Business Intelligence. Ultimate provides sophisticated data query and report authoring via IBM Cognos, a leading suite of business intelligence tools. Our customers can access reports and conduct data queries from a Web browser and are able to apply on-line analytical processing to multidimensional data cubes for exploring data on employees graphically and statistically from diverse angles. We maintain a link between Cognos' report catalog and UltiPro's data dictionary, eliminating the necessity for customers to create and maintain ad hoc reporting catalogs on their own. We also maintain a BI Exchange, an online community where Ultimate professionals and customers can post, download, and share standard reports. We have unified security for the data elements across UltiPro and Cognos instances so that role-based security controls data access across both solutions. We also provide single sign-on to simplify and secure user access.
Data Centers for Cloud Offering 
Our cloud offering provides Web-based access to comprehensive HCM functionality for organizations that want to simplify delivery and support of their business applications. As a part of our cloud offering services, Ultimate provides the hardware, infrastructure, ongoing maintenance and backup services for our customers at four data centers. The data center located near Atlanta, Georgia, is owned and operated by Quality Technology Services (“QTS”). The data centers located near Toronto and Vancouver, Canada, are owned and operated by CenturyLink Technology Services ("CenturyLink") (formerly known as Savvis Communications Canada, Inc.), and the data center located in Phoenix, Arizona, is owned and operated by IO Phoenix One, LLC.
Ultimate's use of the data center located near Atlanta, Georgia, is governed by a Master Space Agreement dated February 2, 2012 with Quality Technology Services Metro, LLC (“QTS Metro”). Pursuant to the terms of the QTS Agreement, Ultimate may from time to time submit orders for the use of certain physical space within the data centers for hosting Ultimate's hardware equipment, as well as Internet connectivity services, security, power and generator back-up, environmental controls and access controls. The QTS Agreement provides that any service order will automatically renew for successive renewal terms, unless either party notifies the other party in writing at least sixty days prior to the end of the then current term that there will be no such renewal. Furthermore, the QTS Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party thereto, if: (i) the non-terminating party breaches any material term of such QTS Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 10 days after receipt of written notice; (ii) the non-terminating party becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding relating to insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, or reorganization; or (iii) a court or other government authority having jurisdiction over the services prohibits the furnishing of services governed by such QTS Agreement.
Ultimate's use of the data centers located near Toronto and Vancouver, Canada, are governed by a Master Services Agreement dated April 30, 2013 (the “CenturyLink Agreement”) between Ultimate's wholly owned subsidiary Ultimate Canada 
10

and CenturyLink. Pursuant to the terms of the CenturyLink Agreement, Ultimate Canada has use of certain physical space within the data center for hosting Ultimate Canada's hardware equipment, as well as Internet connectivity services. The CenturyLink Agreement contains provisions relating to data security and access to the data center. Upon placing a service order, Ultimate Canada is guaranteed certain pricing terms and is committed to minimum usage levels for a period of at least 36 months from the effective date of April 1, 2016, per an addendum entered into by both parties to extend the term of the original agreement. The CenturyLink Agreement will renew on a month-to-month basis unless either party gives at least sixty days written notice prior to the completion of the applicable term that there will be no such renewal. The CenturyLink Agreement provides that its term will end upon the expiration of the term of the last-executed service order. Ultimate has guaranteed the payment of all amounts due from Ultimate Canada to CenturyLink under the CenturyLink Agreement.
Ultimate's use of the data center located near Phoenix, Arizona is governed by a License and Master Services Agreement dated February 27, 2012 (the "IO Phoenix Agreement") with IO Phoenix One, LLC. Pursuant to the terms of the IO Phoenix Agreement, Ultimate has use of certain physical space within the data center for hosting Ultimate's hardware equipment, as well as Internet connectivity services. The IO Phoenix Agreement contains provisions relating to data security and access to the data center. Ultimate is guaranteed certain pricing terms and is committed to minimum usage levels for a period of at least 42 months from November 1, 2014, the effective date of an addendum entered into by both parties to extend the term of the original agreement. The IO Phoenix Agreement will automatically renew thereafter for additional terms of one year unless either party gives written notice prior to the completion of the applicable term that there will be no such renewal. Ultimate must give written notice within 60 days while IO Phoenix must give written notice within 120 days.
Pricing
Our cloud offering is designed to provide an appealing pricing structure to organizations that prefer to minimize the initial cash outlay associated with typical capital expenditures for traditional on-premise products. Our cloud customers purchase the right to use UltiPro on an ongoing basis for a specific term in a shared or dedicated hosted environment, and the arrangement can typically be renewed after its initial term has expired. In the shared environment, Ultimate provides an infrastructure with servers shared among many customers who use a Web browser to access the application software through the related data center. In the dedicated environment, the customer does not share servers with other customers but rather has its own set of servers. The pricing for our cloud offering, including both the hosting element as well as the right to use UltiPro, is on a per employee per month ("PEPM") basis.
Research and Development Activities
Ultimate incurs research and development expenses, consisting primarily of software development personnel costs, in the normal course of our business. Such research and development expenses are for enhancements to our existing products and for the development of new products. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we spent $158.5 million, $120.0 million and $108.8 million, respectively, on research and development activities, gross of capitalized software. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, $37.9 million, $26.3 million and $25.2 million, respectively, of research and development expenses were capitalized for computer software development costs related to an internal-use development project that is expected to be offered in the future. UltiPro Recruiting, a component of the overall capitalized development project, became ready for its intended use during May 2014. UltiPro OnBoarding, another component of the overall capitalized development project, became ready for its intended use during December 2016. Amortization for the components of the development project that are completed will begin when they are ready for their intended use and will be included with cost of recurring revenues in our statement of operations once amortization commences.
Customer Services
Network Products Guide named Ultimate’s services team the “Best Customer Service Department of the Year” in its 2016 IT World Awards, and the Technology Services Industry Association recognized our services team for “Innovation in Transformation of Support Services” in its 2016 TSIA Star Awards. In addition, G2 Crowd recognized Ultimate as #1 in Customer Satisfaction for HR Management Suites in 2016, and we believe this rating is a result of both our services and product teams’ work. G2 Crowd is an online business software review platform that bases its rankings on user reviews of solutions.
We believe that our focus on delivering our customers a positive and productive UltiPro experience has differentiated Ultimate in the marketplace and is critical to the quality of Ultimate's comprehensive service solution. We provide our customer services in two broad categories: (i) professional services and (ii) customer support services and product maintenance. Additionally, we provide services associated with the delivery of our cloud-based solutions. These services include, but are not limited to, purchasing and supporting hardware and system software; installing new versions of UltiPro; and backing up customer data.

Professional Services. Ultimate's professional services include system setup and activation (i.e., implementation), executive relationship management (“ERM”), and knowledge management (or training) services. We believe that our setup and activation consulting services are differentiated from those of other vendors by speed, predictability and completeness. Our successful record with rapid system activation and implementations is due, we believe, to our standardized methodology, consultants, highly configurable product functionality, and comprehensive conversion and integration tools.
Ultimate has a primarily long-tenured team of functional and technical consultants who are dedicated to assisting customers with rapid deployments. In addition, we provide our customers with the opportunity to participate in formal training programs conducted by our knowledge management services team, as well as online scheduled courses and on-demand training. Training programs are designed to increase our customers' ability to use the full functionality of our products, thereby maximizing the value of our customers' investments. Courses are designed to align with the stages of implementation and to give attendees hands-on experience with UltiPro. Trainees learn such basics as how to enter new employee information, set up benefit plans and generate standard reports, as well as more complex processes such as defining company rules, configuring the system and creating custom reports. Ultimate maintains training facilities in Atlanta, Georgia; Schaumburg, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Santa Ana, California; and at our headquarters in Weston, Florida. Ultimate rents training facilities in other locations, such as Toronto, Canada, on an as-needed basis. In addition to offering classes at these facilities, we conduct Web-based training, and provide recorded on-demand training as well as “Quick Tours” for rapid assistance in specific areas of the solution. After our customers have processed their first live payroll using UltiPro (referred to as going “Live”) and have been turned over to our customer support and maintenance program, we assign a customer relationship manager to the account to assist customers obtaining maximum value of the UltiPro solution, connect with other Ultimate users and advanced business analytics. The ERM team also focuses a large portion of its time on customer retention, which is an important aspect of Ultimate's long-term business model.
Customer Support. We offer comprehensive and on-going support services to all of our UltiPro customers. Ultimate had a recurring revenue cloud customer retention rate which was approximately 97% in 2016. Ultimate's customer support services include: software updates that reflect tax and other legislative changes; a named customer service representative; telephone support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; unlimited access to Ultimate's employee tax center on the Web; seminars on year-end closing procedures; a customer blog; and periodic newswire emails. In addition, our customer support services team maintains a Customer Success Portal for our customers where customers can submit inquiries and service requests as well as search a knowledge base of information for instant answers to questions, holds an annual national user conference and arranges for Ultimate professionals to attend smaller, user-organized user group meetings on a routine basis throughout the United States.
Customers
As of December 31, 2016, Ultimate provides our UltiPro solutions to approximately 3,700 customers with approximately 33 million people records in our cloud. Ultimate's customers represent a wide variety of industries, including manufacturing, food services, sports, technology, finance, insurance, retail, real estate, transportation, communications, healthcare and other services. For each of the three years ended December 31, 2016, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. 
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our products and services primarily through our direct sales force.
Our direct sales force includes business development vice presidents, directors and managers who have defined territories, typically geographic. The sales cycle begins with a sales lead generated through a national, corporate marketing campaign or a territory-based activity. In one or more on-site visits, phone-based sales calls, or Web demonstrations, sales managers work with application and technical sales consultants to analyze prospective client needs, demonstrate Ultimate's UltiPro solutions and, when required, respond to requests for proposals. The sale is finalized after customers complete their internal sign-off procedures and the terms of the contract are negotiated and signed.
With a sale of the cloud offering, the agreement generally requires PEPM fees based on company size, and bundled fees for implementation and training. Typical payment terms include a deposit at the time the contract is signed and ongoing PEPM payments on specific payment dates designated in the contract, usually tied to the Live date. 
We support our sales force with a comprehensive marketing program that includes public relations, advertising, direct mail, trade shows, seminars and workshops, email marketing, social media marketing, and Web marketing. Working closely with the direct sales force, customers and strategic partners, our marketing team defines positioning strategies and develops a well-defined plan for implementing these strategies. Our marketing services include market surveys and research, overall 
12

campaign management, creative development, demand generation, results analysis, and communications with field offices, customers, and marketing partners.
Intellectual Property Rights
Ultimate's success is dependent, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We do not have any patents or patent applications pending.
Competition
The market for our products is highly competitive. Our products compete primarily on the basis of technology, delivered functionality, price/performance and service.
Ultimate's competitors in our enterprise market include (i) large service bureaus, primarily Automatic Data Processing Inc. (“ADP”) and, to a lesser extent, Ceridian; and (ii) companies, such as Oracle, Lawson, and Workday that offer human resource management and payroll software products for use on mainframes, client/server environments and/or Web servers. In our mid-market and strategic market, Ultimate's competitors include payroll service providers, such as ADP, Ceridian and Paychex.
Backlog
Backlog consists of our UltiPro cloud-based solutions under signed contracts for which the services have not yet been delivered. Our backlog amounts include the full contract value of sales to our customers that have not yet processed their first payroll using UltiPro and are not indicative of the annual recurring revenue value of such sales. Backlog can vary from one year to the next when the average contract period fluctuates significantly. At December 31, 2016, Ultimate had backlog of $399.9 million compared with $320.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Ultimate expects to fill approximately $349.6 million of the backlog during 2017. Ultimate does not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of sales that can be expected for any future period. There can be no assurance that backlog at any point in time will translate into revenue in any subsequent period.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, Ultimate employed 3,747 people. Ultimate believes that our leadership's relationships with employees are good, and that belief is validated by Ultimate’s # 1 ranking on Fortune's 2016 list of "10 Best Large Workplaces in Technology", #15 on Fortune's 2016 “100 Best Companies to Work For” list and #5 on Fortune's 2016"100 Best Workplaces for Millennials." Also in 2016, Fortune ranked Ultimate # 4 on its list of 100 Best Workplaces for Women and # 5 on its list of 50 Best Workplaces for Diversity. All of these Fortune rankings are determined largely by scores on anonymous employee surveys administered by the Great Place to Work Institute. As reported by Bloomberg.com in November 2015, from a universe of approximately 445,000 companies evaluated, Ultimate received the highest positive-performance outlook from its employees on Glassdoor, exceeding 90%, more than double the Glassdoor company-average of 43%. Ultimate's consistent history of good employee relationships is further validated by Ultimate's #20 ranking on Fortune's 2014 “100 Best Companies to Work For” list, # 9 ranking on its 2013 list, # 25 ranking on its 2012 list, and the Great Place to Work Institute's ranking of Ultimate as the #1 Best Place to Work in America among medium-sized companies for both 2009 and 2008. However, competition for qualified employees in the technology sector and Ultimate's industry is intense. Management of Ultimate believes that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.
