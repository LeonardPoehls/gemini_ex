 Introduction 
 American River Bankshares (the “Company”) is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1995. As a bank holding company, the Company is authorized to engage in the activities permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and regulations thereunder. Its principal office is located at 3100 Zinfandel Drive, Suite 450, Rancho Cordova, California 95670 and its telephone number is (916) 851-0123.
 The Company owns 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of its banking subsidiary, American River Bank, and American River Financial, a California corporation which has been inactive since its incorporation in 2003.
 American River Bank was incorporated and commenced business in Fair Oaks, California, in 1983 and thereafter moved its headquarters to Sacramento, California in 1985. American River Bank operates four full service offices in Sacramento County including the main office located at 1545 River Park Drive, Suite 107, Sacramento and branch offices in Sacramento and Gold River; one full service office in Placer County, located in Roseville; two full service offices in Sonoma County in Healdsburg and Santa Rosa; and three full service offices in Amador County in Jackson, Pioneer, and Ione. In 2000, North Coast Bank was acquired by the Company as a separate bank subsidiary. Effective December 31, 2003, North Coast Bank was merged with and into American River Bank. On December 3, 2004, the Company acquired Bank of Amador located in Jackson, California. Bank of Amador was merged with and into American River Bank.
 American River Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to applicable legal limits. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act includes an increase to $250,000 as the maximum FDIC insurance limit per depositor retroactive to January 1, 2008. On November 9, 2010, the FDIC implemented a final rule to permanently increase the maximum insurance limit to $250,000 under the Dodd-Frank Act.
 American River Bank does not offer trust services or international banking services and does not plan to do so in the near future. American River Bank’s primary business is serving the commercial banking needs of small to mid-sized businesses within those counties listed above. American River Bank accepts checking and savings deposits, offers money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit, makes secured and unsecured commercial, secured real estate, and other installment and term loans and offers other customary banking services. American River Bank also conducts lease financing for most types of business equipment, from computer software to heavy earth-moving equipment. American River Bank owns 100% of two inactive companies, ARBCO and American River Mortgage. ARBCO was formed in 1984 to conduct real estate development and has been inactive since 1995. American River Mortgage has been inactive since its formation in 1994.
 During 2017, the Company conducted no significant activities other than holding the shares of its subsidiaries. However, it is authorized, with the prior approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Board of Governors”), the Company’s principal regulator, to engage in a variety of activities which are deemed closely related to the business of banking.

The common stock of the Company is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AMRB.”
 At December 31, 2017, the Company had consolidated assets of $656 million, net loans of $309 million, deposits of $556 million and shareholders’ equity of $77 million.
 General
 
The Company is a regional bank holding company headquartered in Sacramento County, California. The principal communities served are located in Sacramento, Placer, Yolo, El Dorado, Sonoma, and Amador counties. The Company generates most of its revenue by providing a wide range of products and services to small and middle-market businesses and individuals. The Company’s principal source of revenue comes from interest income. Interest income is derived from interest and fees on loans and leases, interest on investments (principally government securities), and Federal funds sold (funds loaned on a short-term basis to other banks). For the year ended December 31, 2017, these sources comprised 68.6%, 31.4%, and 0.0%, respectively, of the Company’s interest income.
 American River Bank’s deposits are not received from a single depositor or group of affiliated depositors, the loss of any one of which would have a materially adverse effect on the business of the Company. A material portion of American River Bank’s deposits are not concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries.
 As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, American River Bank held $29,000,000 in certificates of deposit for the State of California. In connection with these deposits, American River Bank is generally required to pledge securities to secure such deposits, except for the first $250,000 insured by the FDIC.
 Based on the most recent information made available by the FDIC through June 30, 2017, American River Bank competes with approximately 32 other banking or savings institutions in Sacramento County, 25 in Placer County, 19 in Sonoma County and 6 in Amador County, in which American River Bank’s market share of FDIC insured deposits was approximately 0.9% in the service areas of Sacramento County, 0.5% in Placer County, 0.6% in Sonoma County, and 15.3% in Amador County.
 Employees
 At December 31, 2017, the Company and its subsidiaries employed 91 persons on a full-time equivalent basis. The Company believes its employee relations are good.

Competition
 General Competitive Factors
 In order to compete with the major financial institutions in its primary service areas, American River Bank uses to the fullest extent possible the flexibility which is accorded by their community bank status. This includes an emphasis on specialized services, local promotional activity, and personal contacts by their respective officers, directors and employees. American River Bank also seeks to provide special services and programs for individuals in their primary service area who are employed in the agricultural, professional and business fields, such as loans for equipment, furniture, tools of the trade or expansion of practices or businesses. In the event there are customers whose loan demands exceed their respective lending limits, they seek to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with other financial institutions. Furthermore, American River Bank also assists those customers requiring services not offered by either bank to obtain such services from correspondent banks.

-

Commercial banks compete with savings and loan associations, credit unions, other financial institutions and other entities for funds. For instance, yields on corporate and government debt securities and other commercial paper affect the ability of commercial banks to attract and hold deposits. Commercial banks also compete for loans with savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, mortgage companies and other lending institutions.
 Banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials. In general, the difference between the interest rate paid by a bank to obtain their deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received by a bank on loans extended to customers and on securities held in a bank’s portfolio comprise the major portion of a bank’s revenues.
 The interest rate differentials of a bank, and therefore their revenues, are affected not only by general economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States as set by statutes and as implemented by federal agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board can and does implement national monetary policy, such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession, by its open market operations in United States government securities, adjustments in the amount of interest free reserves that banks and other financial institutions are required to maintain, and adjustments to the discount rates applicable to borrowing by banks from the Federal Reserve Board. These activities influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies and their impact on American River Bank is not predictable.
 Competitive Data
 At June 30, 2017, based on the most recent “Data Book Summary of Deposits in FDIC Insured Commercial and Savings Banks” report at that date, the competing commercial and savings banks had 181 offices in the cities of Gold River, Rancho Cordova, Roseville and Sacramento, California, where American River Bank has its five Sacramento area offices, 60 offices in the cities of Healdsburg and Santa Rosa, California, where American River Bank has its two Sonoma County offices, and three offices in the cities of Jackson, Pioneer and Ione, California, where American River Bank has its three Amador County offices. Additionally, American River Bank competes with thrifts and, to a lesser extent, credit unions, finance companies and other financial service providers for deposit and loan customers.
 Larger banks may have a competitive advantage because of higher lending limits and major advertising and marketing campaigns. They also perform services, such as trust services, international banking, discount brokerage and insurance services, which American River Bank is neither authorized nor prepared to offer currently. American River Bank has made arrangements with its correspondent banks and with others to provide some of these services for its customers. For borrowers requiring loans in excess of American River Bank’s legal lending limits, American River Bank has offered, and intends to offer in the future, such loans on a participating basis with its correspondent banks and with other community banks, retaining the portion of such loans which is within its lending limits. As of December 31, 2017, American River Bank’s aggregate legal lending limits to a single borrower and such borrower’s related parties were $12,093,000 on an unsecured basis and $20,155,000 on a fully secured basis based on capital and allowable reserves of $80,618,000.
 American River Bank’s business is concentrated in its service area, which primarily encompasses Sacramento County, South Western Placer County, Sonoma County, and Amador County. The economy of American River Bank’s service area is dependent upon government, manufacturing, tourism, retail sales, agriculture, population growth and smaller service oriented businesses.
 Based upon the most recent “Data Book Summary of Deposits in FDIC Insured Commercial and Savings Banks” report dated June 30, 2017, there were 219 operating commercial and savings bank offices in Sacramento County with total deposits of $32,447,098,000. This was an increase of $2,151,334,000 compared to the June 30, 2016 balances. American River Bank held a total of $291,532,000 in deposits, representing approximately 0.9% of total commercial and savings banks deposits in Sacramento County as of June 30, 2017.
 Based upon the most recent “Data Book Summary of Deposits in FDIC Insured Commercial and Savings Banks” report dated June 30, 2017, there were 98 operating commercial and savings bank offices in Placer County with total deposits of $12,233,315,000. This was a decrease of $529,101,000 compared to the June 30, 2016 balances. American River Bank held a total of $59,750,000 in deposits, representing approximately 0.5% of total commercial and savings banks deposits in Placer County as of June 30, 2017.

American River Bank held a total of $114,779,000 in deposits, representing approximately 15.3% of total commercial and savings bank deposits in Amador County as of June 30, 2017.
 Supervision and Regulation
 General
 American River Bankshares is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Bank Holding Company Act”), and is registered as such with, and subject to the supervision of, the Board of Governors. The Company is required to obtain the approval of the Board of Governors before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of the voting shares of any bank if, after giving effect to such acquisition of shares, the Company would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank. The Bank Holding Company Act prohibits the Company from acquiring any voting shares of, or interest in, all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located outside the State of California unless such an acquisition is specifically authorized by the laws of the state in which such bank is located. Any such interstate acquisition is also subject to applicable California and federal law.
 The common stock of the Company is subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the qualification requirements of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968, as amended. The Company is also subject to the periodic reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which include, but are not limited to, annual, quarterly and other current reports with the SEC.
 The Company, and any subsidiaries which it may acquire or organize, are deemed to be “affiliates” within the meaning of that term as defined in the Federal Reserve Act. This means, for example, that there are limitations (a) on loans by American River Bank to affiliates, (b) on investments by American River Bank in affiliates’ stock as collateral for loans to any borrower, and (c) other transactions between any bank subsidiary and the Company. The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting, public sale and distribution of securities.
 
American River Bank is licensed by the California Commissioner of the Department of Business Oversight (the “Commissioner”), and its deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable legal limits. On November 9, 2010, the FDIC implemented a final rule under the Dodd-Frank Act to permanently increase the maximum insurance limit to $250,000 per depositor. American River Bank has chosen not to become a member of the Federal Reserve System. Consequently, American River Bank is subject to the supervision of, and is regularly examined by, the Commissioner and the FDIC. The supervision and regulation includes comprehensive reviews of all major aspects of American River Bank’s business and condition, including its capital ratios, allowance for possible loan and lease losses and other factors. However, no inference should be drawn that such authorities have approved any such factors. American River Bankshares and American River Bank are required to file reports with the Board of Governors, the Commissioner, and the FDIC and provide any additional information that the Board of Governors, the Commissioner, and the FDIC may require.

Capital Standards
 Risk-Based Capital. The Board of Governors and the FDIC adopted risk-based capital guidelines for evaluating the capital adequacy of bank holding companies and banks. The guidelines were designed to make capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, to take into account off-balance sheet exposures and to aid in making the definition of bank capital uniform internationally. Under the risk-based guidelines and prior to amendments to the capital rules effective January 1, 2015 as described below in “Basel III - New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations,” American River Bankshares and American River Bank were required to maintain capital equal to at least 8.0% of its assets and commitments to extend credit, weighted by risk, of which at least 4.0% was required to consist primarily of common equity (including retained earnings) and the remainder was to consist of subordinated debt, cumulative preferred stock, or a limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves.
 Assets, commitments to extend credit, and off-balance sheet items were categorized according to risk and certain assets considered to present less risk than others permitted maintenance of capital at less than the 8% ratio. For example, most home mortgage loans were placed in a 50% risk category and therefore required maintenance of capital equal to 4% of those loans, while commercial loans were placed in a 100% risk category and therefore required maintenance of capital equal to 8% of those loans.
 Under the risk-based capital guidelines, assets reported on an institution’s balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet items are assigned to risk categories, each of which has an assigned risk weight. Capital ratios are calculated by dividing the institution’s qualifying capital by its period-end risk-weighted assets. The guidelines established two categories of qualifying capital: Tier 1 capital (core capital including common shareholders’ equity and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock) and Tier 2 capital (supplementary capital which includes, among other items, limited life (and in the case of banks, cumulative) preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and a limited amount of reserve for credit losses. Each institution is required to maintain a minimum risk-based capital ratio (including Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) of 8%, of which at least half must be Tier 1 capital.
 A leverage capital standard was adopted as a supplement to the risk-weighted capital guidelines. Under the leverage capital standard, an institution was required to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to the sum of its quarterly average total assets and quarterly average reserve for loan losses, less intangible assets not included in Tier 1 capital. Period-end assets may be used in place of quarterly average total assets on a case-by-case basis. The Board of Governors and the FDIC also adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies as a supplement to the risk-weighted capital guidelines. The leverage ratio establishes a minimum Tier 1 ratio of 3% (Tier 1 capital to total assets) for the highest rated bank holding companies or those that have implemented the risk-based capital market risk measure. All other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% with higher leverage capital ratios required for bank holding companies that have significant financial and/or operational weakness, a high-risk profile, or are undergoing or anticipating rapid growth.
 Effective January 1, 2015, the risk-based capital regulations described above were amended to the extent described below in “Basel III - New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations.”
 Basel III – New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. In July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued interim final rules that revised and replaced the risk-based capital requirements in order to implement the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Basel III reforms reflected in the final rules include an increase in the risk-based capital requirements and certain changes to capital components, as well as changes to the calculation and categories of risk-weighted assets. For example, changes to risk weighted assets include increasing the original risk weight to 150% on assets past due 90 days or more or on nonaccrual, utilizing loan to value ratios in the risk weighting of mortgage loans and assigning a 150% risk weight to certain higher risk commercial real estate loans.
 
Effective January 1, 2015, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 Billion or more and banks like American River Bank must comply with new minimum capital ratio requirements to be phased-in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2019, which consist of the following: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 8% (unchanged); and (iv) a Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets (“leverage”) ratio of 4%.
  
8
-

In addition, a “capital conservation buffer,” is established which when fully phased-in will require maintenance of a minimum of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets in excess of the regulatory minimum capital ratio requirements described above. The 2.5% buffer will increase the minimum capital ratios to (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new buffer requirement will be phased-in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. If the capital ratio levels of a banking organization fall below the capital conservation buffer amount, the organization will be subject to limitations on (i) the payment of dividends; (ii) discretionary bonus payments; (iii) discretionary payments under Tier 1 instruments; and (iv) engaging in share repurchases.
 
The federal bank regulatory agencies also implemented changes to the prompt corrective action framework described below under “Prompt Corrective Action,” which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital ratios begin to show signs of weakness. These changes took effect beginning January 1, 2015 and require insured depository institutions to meet the following increased capital ratio requirements in order to qualify as “well capitalized:” (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 10%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%. In order to qualify as “adequately capitalized,” institutions must have (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. See also the additional requirements of the prompt corrective action framework discussed below under “Prompt Corrective Action.”
 
Management believes that American River Bank is in compliance with the minimum capital requirements, including the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement based upon its capital position at December 31, 2017.
 
Prompt Corrective Action
 The Board of Governors and the FDIC adopted regulations implementing a system of prompt corrective action pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Section 131 of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”). Prior to amendments to the capital rules effective January 1, 2015 as described above in “Basel III - New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations,” the regulations established five capital categories with the following characteristics: (1) “Well capitalized” - consisting of institutions with a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and the institution is not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive; (2) “Adequately capitalized” - consisting of institutions with a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4% or greater, and the institution does not meet the definition of a “well capitalized” institution; (3) “Undercapitalized” - consisting of institutions with a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, or a leverage ratio of less than 4%; (4) “Significantly undercapitalized” - consisting of institutions with a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3%; (5) “Critically undercapitalized” - consisting of an institution with a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.
 The regulations established procedures for classification of financial institutions within the capital categories, filing and reviewing capital restoration plans required under the regulations and procedures for issuance of directives by the appropriate regulatory agency, among other matters. The regulations impose restrictions upon all institutions to refrain from certain actions which would cause an institution to be classified within any one of the three “undercapitalized” categories, such as declaration of dividends or other capital distributions or payment of management fees, if following the distribution or payment the institution would be classified within one of the “undercapitalized” categories. In addition, institutions which are classified in one of the three “undercapitalized” categories are subject to certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions. Mandatory supervisory actions include (1) increased monitoring and review by the appropriate federal banking agency; (2) implementation of a capital restoration plan; (3) total asset growth restrictions; and (4) limitations upon acquisitions, branch expansion, and new business activities without prior approval of the appropriate federal banking agency. Discretionary supervisory actions may include (1) requirements to augment capital; (2) restrictions upon affiliate transactions; (3) restrictions upon deposit gathering activities and interest rates paid; (4) replacement of senior executive officers and directors; (5) restrictions upon activities of the institution and its affiliates; (6) requiring divestiture or sale of the institution; and (7) any other supervisory action that the appropriate federal banking agency determines is necessary to further the purposes of the regulations. Further, the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5 percent of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized, and (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it were “significantly undercapitalized.” FDICIA also restricts the solicitation and acceptance of and interest rates payable on brokered deposits by insured depository institutions that are not “well capitalized.” An “undercapitalized” institution is not allowed to solicit deposits by offering rates of interest that are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on insured deposits in the particular institution’s normal market areas or in the market areas in which such deposits would otherwise be accepted.

Any financial institution which is classified as “critically undercapitalized” must be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days of such determination unless it is also determined that some other course of action would better serve the purposes of the regulations. Critically undercapitalized institutions are also prohibited from making (but not accruing) any payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt without prior regulatory approval and regulators must prohibit a critically undercapitalized institution from taking certain other actions without prior approval, including (1) entering into any material transaction other than in the usual course of business, including investment expansion, acquisition, sale of assets or other similar actions; (2) extending credit for any highly leveraged transaction; (3) amending articles or bylaws unless required to do so to comply with any law, regulation or order; (4) making any material change in accounting methods; (5) engaging in certain affiliate transactions; (6) paying excessive compensation or bonuses; and (7) paying interest on new or renewed liabilities at rates which would increase the weighted average costs of funds beyond prevailing rates in the institution’s normal market areas.
 On November 18, 2014, the FDIC adopted the Assessments Final Rule which revises the FDIC’s risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to reflect changes in the regulatory capital rules effective commencing January 1, 2015. For smaller financial institutions (with total assets less than $1 Billion and which are not custodial banks), the Final Rule revised and conformed capital ratios and ratio thresholds to the new prompt corrective action capital ratios and ratio thresholds for “well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” evaluations which were adopted by the federal banking agencies as part of the Basel III capital regulations. Consequently, effective January 1, 2015, the prompt corrective action regulations were amended to the extent described above in “Basel III – New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations.”
 Additional Regulations
 Under the FDICIA, the federal financial institution agencies have adopted regulations which require institutions to establish and maintain comprehensive written real estate policies which address certain lending considerations, including loan-to-value limits, loan administrative policies, portfolio diversification standards, and documentation, approval and reporting requirements. The FDICIA further generally prohibits an insured state bank from engaging as a principal in any activity that is impermissible for a national bank, absent FDIC determination that the activity would not pose a significant risk to the Bank Insurance Fund, and that the bank is, and will continue to be, within applicable capital standards.
 The Federal Financial Institution Examination Counsel (“FFIEC”) utilizes the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (“UFIRS”) commonly referred to as “CAMELS” to classify and evaluate the soundness of financial institutions. Bank examiners use the CAMELS measurements to evaluate capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk. Effective January 1, 2005, bank holding companies such as the Company, were subject to evaluation and examination under a revised bank holding company rating system. The so-called BOPEC rating system implemented in 1979 was primarily focused on financial condition, consolidated capital and consolidated earnings. The rating system reflects the change toward analysis of risk management (as reflected in bank examination under the CAMELS measurements), in addition to financial factors and the potential impact of nondepository subsidiaries upon depository institution subsidiaries.
 The federal financial institution agencies have established bases for analysis and standards for assessing a financial institution’s capital adequacy in conjunction with the risk-based and Basel III capital guidelines including analysis of interest rate risk, concentrations of credit risk, risk posed by non-traditional activities, and factors affecting overall safety and soundness. The safety and soundness standards for insured financial institutions include analysis of (1) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest rate exposure; (5) asset growth; (6) compensation, fees and benefits; and (7) excessive compensation for executive officers, directors or principal shareholders which could lead to material financial loss. If an agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard, the agency may require the financial institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If the agency requires submission of a compliance plan and the institution fails to timely submit an acceptable plan or to implement an accepted plan, the agency must require the institution to correct the deficiency. The agencies may elect to initiate enforcement action in certain cases rather than rely on an existing plan particularly where failure to meet one or more of the standards could threaten the safe and sound operation of the institution.

Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) regulations evaluate banks’ lending to low and moderate income individuals and businesses across a four-point scale from “outstanding” to “substantial noncompliance,” and are a factor in regulatory review of applications to merge, establish new branches or form bank holding companies. In addition, any bank rated in “substantial noncompliance” with the CRA regulations may be subject to enforcement proceedings. In its most recent exam for CRA compliance, American River Bank has a rating of “satisfactory.”
 Limitations on Dividends
 The Company’s ability to pay cash dividends is subject to restrictions set forth in the California General Corporation Law. Funds for payment of any cash dividends by the Company would be obtained from its investments as well as dividends and/or management fees from its subsidiaries. The payment of cash dividends and/or management fees by American River Bank is subject to restrictions set forth in the California Financial Code, as well as restrictions established by the FDIC. On January 25, 2017, the Board of Directors resumed the payment of cash dividends. The Company relies on distributions from American River Bank in the form of cash dividends in order to pay cash dividends to our shareholders. See Item 5. “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for more information regarding cash dividends.
 FDIC Insurance
 On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”) was signed into law. The EESA temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance coverage provided by the FDIC from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) into law. On November 9, 2010, the FDIC issued a final rule implementing section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act that permanently raised the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount per depositor to $250,000. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act also made other deposit insurance changes which may affect our insurance premium assessments to include (i) amendment of the assessment base used to calculate an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF by elimination of deposits and substitution of average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period as the revised assessment base; (ii) increasing the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits; (iii) eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds; and (iv) repeal of the prohibition upon the payment of interest on demand deposits to be effective one year after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 On November 18, 2014, the FDIC adopted the Assessments Final Rule which revises the FDIC’s risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to reflect changes in the regulatory capital rules adopted by the federal banking agencies as part of the so-called Basel III capital regulations to conform the prompt corrective action capital ratios and ratio thresholds for “well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” evaluations.
 On June 16, 2015, the FDIC proposed changes to the deposit insurance assessments for small insured banks having total assets less than $10 Billion which have been insured for at least five years, based upon experience with bank failures. The changes, among other matters, revise the financial ratios method of determining assessments to reflect a statistical model estimating the probability of failure over three years and updating the financial measures used in the financial ratios method consistent with the statistical model. The FDIC proposed additional changes on October 22, 2015 to require banks with over $10 Billion in assets to be responsible for the recapitalization of the DIF to 1.35 percent of insured deposits after achieving a 1.15 percent reserve ratio. On January 21, 2016, the FDIC proposed further revisions to the small insured bank assessments as the result of comments and recommendations received in response to its earlier proposal. The FDIC proposed that a final rule would go into effect the quarter after adoption, but the amendments would not become operative until the quarter after the DIF reserve ratio reached 1.15 percent. The DIF achieved a reserve ratio of 1.17 as of June 30, 2016. Among the effects of the amendments was a reduction in the initial assessment rates for all banks.

Although American River Bank’s recent assessments have declined as a result of the change to the deposit assessment system, it is uncertain what effect the implementation of the changes to the insurance assessments will have upon the Company’s cost of operations in the future, but a deterioration in the economic conditions impacting financial institutions or a significant number of failed institutions might necessitate increases in premium assessments to maintain the DIF which could adversely impact the Company’s earnings.
 Impact of Certain Legislation and Regulation
 Interstate Banking. The Dodd-Frank Act signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010, includes provisions authorizing national and state banks to establish branch offices in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch. Previously, banks could only establish branch offices in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branch offices in that state.  Accordingly, banks may be able to enter new markets more freely.
 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLB Act”) was signed into law. The GLB Act eliminated most of the remaining depression-era “firewalls” between banks, securities firms and insurance companies which were established by The Banking Act of 1933, also known as the Glass-Steagall Act (“Glass-Steagall”). Glass-Steagall sought to insulate banks as depository institutions from the perceived risks of securities dealing and underwriting, and related activities. The GLB Act permitted bank holding companies that could qualify as “financial holding companies” to acquire securities firms or create them as subsidiaries, and securities firms could acquire banks or start banking activities through a financial holding company. Prior to the GLB Act, banks were also (with minor exceptions) prohibited from engaging in insurance activities or affiliating with insurers. The GLB Act removed these restrictions and substantially eliminated the prohibitions under the Bank Holding Company Act on affiliations between banks and insurance companies. Consequently, the common ownership of banks, securities firms and insurance firms was possible, in addition to the conduct of commercial banking, merchant banking, investment management, securities underwriting and insurance within a single financial institution using a “financial holding company” structure authorized by the GLB Act.
 A bank holding company could qualify as a financial holding company if (i) its banking subsidiaries are “well capitalized” and “well managed” and (ii) it files with the Board of Governors a certification to such effect and a declaration that it elects to become a financial holding company. The Bank Holding Company Act was amended to permit financial holding companies to engage in activities, and acquire companies engaged in activities, that are financial in nature or incidental to such financial activities. Financial holding companies were also permitted to engage in activities that were complementary to financial activities if the Board of Governors determined that the activity did not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general. These standards expanded upon the list of activities “closely related to banking” which have defined the permissible activities of bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act. Neither the Company nor American River Bank has determined whether or when to seek to acquire and exercise powers or activities under the GLB Act.
 Volcker Rule. On December 10, 2013, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule implementing the so-called “Volcker Rule” (set forth in Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act). The Volcker Rule prohibits depository institutions, companies that control such institutions, bank holding companies, and the affiliates and subsidiaries of such banking entities, from engaging as principal for the trading account of the banking entity in any purchase or sale of one or more covered financial instruments (so-called “proprietary trading”) and imposes limitations upon retaining ownership interests in, sponsoring, investing in and transacting with certain investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. The effective date of the final rule restricting proprietary trading was extended to July 21, 2015 and certain other matters were extended to July 21, 2017. Neither the Company nor American River Bank engages in activities prohibited by the Volcker Rule nor do we expect the Volcker Rule to have a material impact upon the Company or American River Bank.
 Patriot Act. On October 26, 2001, President Bush signed the USA Patriot Act (the “Patriot Act”), which includes provisions pertaining to domestic security, surveillance procedures, border protection, and terrorism laws to be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. Title III of the Patriot Act entitled, “International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001” includes amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act which expand the responsibilities of financial institutions in regard to anti-money laundering activities with particular emphasis upon international money laundering and terrorism financing activities through designated correspondent and private banking accounts.

The Patriot Act contains various provisions that affect the operations of financial institutions by encouraging cooperation among financial institutions, regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities with respect to individuals, entities and organizations engaged in, or reasonably suspected of engaging in, terrorist acts or money laundering activities. The Company and American River Bank are not currently aware of any account relationships between American River Bank and any foreign bank or other person or entity which would not be in compliance with the Patriot Act.
 Certain surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act expired on June 1, 2015, but were renewed the next day by the passage of the USA Freedom Act on June 2, 2015 and extended through 2019. However, the provision under which the National Security Agency (“NSA”) conducted mass phone data collection on individuals was changed to require the NSA to seek permission from a federal court in order to obtain such data from phone companies.
 The effects which the Patriot Act and any amendments to the Patriot Act or additional legislation enacted by Congress may have upon financial institutions is uncertain; however, such legislation could increase compliance costs and thereby potentially may have an adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act. On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”) which responded to issues in corporate governance and accountability. Among other matters, key provisions of the Act and rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Act include enhancement of financial disclosures and related certification requirements, rules related to audit committees, auditor independence, ethics requirements, securities trading prohibitions, securities reporting requirements, and securities listing requirements.
 The Company’s securities are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Consequently, in addition to the rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Act, the Company must also comply with the listing standards applicable to Nasdaq listed companies. The Nasdaq listing standards applicable to the Company include standards related to (i) director independence, (ii) executive session meetings of the board, (iii) requirements for audit, nominating and compensation committee charters, membership qualifications and procedures, (iv) shareholder approval of equity compensation arrangements, and (v) code of conduct requirements that comply with the code of ethics under the Act.
 The effect of the Act upon the Company is uncertain; however, the Company has incurred and it is anticipated that it will continue to incur increased costs to comply with the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the Act by the SEC, Nasdaq and other regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the Company or the issuance and listing of its securities. The Company does not currently anticipate, however, that compliance with the Act and such rules and regulations will have a material adverse effect upon its financial position or results of its operations or its cash flows.
 Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. The Board of Governors, the FDIC, the other federal financial institution regulatory agencies, and the Federal Trade Commission issued final rules and guidelines effective January 1, 2008, subject to mandatory compliance as of November 1, 2008, implementing sections 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 to require financial institutions and other creditors to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program. The program must include reasonable policies and procedures for detecting, preventing, and mitigating identity theft in connection with certain new and existing covered accounts. Covered accounts are defined as (i) an account primarily for personal, family, or household purposes (i.e., consumer accounts), or (ii) any other account for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft. The program must be appropriate to the size and complexity of the financial institution or creditor and the nature and scope of its activities and should be designed to:
 
· | identify relevant patterns, practices, and specific forms of activity that are “red flags” of possible identity theft and incorporate those red flags into the program; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | detect the occurrence of red flags incorporated into the program; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ensure that the program is updated periodically to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The regulations include guidelines that each financial institution must consider and, to the extent appropriate, include in its program and steps that must be taken to administer the program including (i) obtaining approval of the program by the board of directors or a committee of the board, (ii) ensuring oversight of the development, implementation and administration of the program, (iii) training staff, and (iv) overseeing service provider arrangements. The guidelines contemplate that existing fraud prevention procedures may be incorporated into the program.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to restructure the regulation of the financial services sector by, among other things, (i) establishing a framework to identify systemic risks in the financial system implemented by a newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council and other federal banking agencies; (ii) expanding the resolution authority of the federal banking agencies over troubled financial institutions; (iii) authorizing changes to capital and liquidity requirements; (iv) changing deposit insurance assessments; and (v) enhancing regulatory supervision to improve the safety and soundness of the financial services sector. Below is a summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which, directly or indirectly, may affect us.
 
· | Changes to Capital Requirements. The federal banking agencies are required to establish revised minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires capital requirements to be counter cyclical so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction consistent with safety and soundness. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhanced Regulatory Supervision. The Dodd-Frank Act increases regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks, bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB is responsible for establishing and implementing rules and regulations under various federal consumer protection laws governing certain consumer products and services. The CFPB has primary enforcement authority over large financial institutions with assets of $10 Billion or more, while smaller institutions will be subject to the CFPB’s rules and regulations through the enforcement authority of the federal banking agencies. States are permitted to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those laws and regulations adopted by the CFPB and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection laws and regulations adopted by the CFPB. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the deposit insurance limit for insured deposits to $250,000 per depositor. Other deposit insurance changes under the Dodd-Frank Act include (i) amendment of the assessment base used to calculate an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) by elimination of deposits and substitution of average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period as the revised assessment base; (ii) increasing the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits; (iii) eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds; and (iv) repeal of the prohibition upon the payment of interest on demand deposits to be effective one year after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC has proposed further changes to the deposit insurance assessments applicable to small insured depository institutions with assets less than $10 Billion and additional DIF recapitalization obligations for insured depository institutions with more than $10 Billion in assets. See the discussion of these changes in “Supervision and Regulation - FDIC Insurance.” 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transactions with Affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transactions with Insiders. Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution’s board of directors.

· | Enhanced Lending Limitations. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthens the existing limits on a depository institution’s credit exposure to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Debit Card Interchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the amount of any interchange fee charged by a debit card issuer with respect to a debit card transaction must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer. The Federal Reserve Board was required to establish standards for reasonable and proportional fees which may take into account the costs of preventing fraud. The restrictions on interchange fees, however, do not apply to banks that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10 Billion. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Interstate Branching. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes national and state banks to establish branch offices in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch. Previously, banks could only establish branch offices in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branch offices in that state. Accordingly, banks may be able to enter new markets more freely. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Charter Conversions. Effective one year after enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, depository institutions that are subject to a cease and desist order or certain other enforcement actions issued with respect to a significant supervisory matter are prohibited from changing their federal or state charters, except in accordance with certain notice, application and other procedures involving the applicable regulatory agencies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Compensation Practices. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that the appropriate federal banking regulators must establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensation plan of a bank holding company or other “covered financial institution” that provides an insider or other employee with “excessive compensation” or could lead to a material financial loss to such firm. In June 2010, prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies jointly issued the Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies (“Guidance”), which requires that financial institutions establish metrics for measuring the risk to the financial institution of such loss from incentive compensation arrangements and implement policies to prohibit inappropriate risk taking that may lead to material financial loss to the institution. Together, the Dodd-Frank Act and the Guidance may impact our compensation policies and arrangements. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act will enhance corporate governance requirements to include (i) requiring publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the date of enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on so-called “golden parachute” payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions unless previously voted on by shareholders; (ii) authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates for election as directors using a company’s proxy materials; (iii) directing the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1 Billion, regardless of whether or not the company is publicly traded; and (iv) authorizing the SEC to prohibit broker discretionary voting on the election of directors and on executive compensation matters. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act are anticipated to be implemented over an extended period of time, unless the implementation is changed as the result of additional legislation promulgated by Congress or as a result of actions taken by the administration of President Trump. Therefore, the nature and extent of regulations that will be issued by various regulatory agencies and the impact such regulations will have on the operations of financial institutions such as ours is unclear. Such regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.

2017 Tax Reform Law
 
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law “H.R.1” commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which among other matters reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The lowering of the tax rate is expected to cause banks that carry net deferred tax assets on their balance-sheets (i.e., tax positions carried forward to offset against future taxes) to take charges against the valuation of their net deferred tax assets because the higher the tax rate, the more these net deferred tax assets are worth. Hence, the reduction of the federal corporate-tax rate from the Company’s 2017 rate of 34% to the projected future rate of 21%, reduced the value of these net deferred tax assets. Charges of $1,220,000 against the Company’s net deferred tax assets were recorded as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Future Legislation and Regulation 
 In addition to legislative changes, the various federal and state financial institution regulatory agencies frequently propose rules and regulations to implement and enforce already existing legislation. It cannot be predicted whether or in what form any such rules or regulations will be enacted or the effect that such regulations may have on American River Bankshares or American River Bank. However, despite reported comments made by the administration of President Trump regarding the effect of regulations upon the current conditions in the U.S. financial markets and economy, it remains uncertain whether Congress will enact legislation which provides regulatory relief to financial institutions or alter the focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. The Company anticipates that additional regulations would likely increase the Company’s expenses, which may adversely impact the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, future prospects, profitability, and stock price.
