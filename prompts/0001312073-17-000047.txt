ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Our Company
Verifone is a global leader in payments and commerce solutions at the point of sale (“POS”). For over 35 years, we have designed, manufactured, marketed and supplied a broad range of innovative payment solutions and complementary services. Our solutions enable merchants and the institutions that serve them to securely accept electronic forms of payment and ensure regulatory and industry standards compliance; enable value-added exchange between merchants and consumers; and enhance payment security. Key industries in which we operate include financial services, retail, petroleum, restaurant, hospitality, transportation, and healthcare.
VeriFone, Inc., our principal operating subsidiary, was incorporated in 1981. Shortly afterward, we introduced the first check verification and credit authorization device utilized by merchants in a commercial setting. In 1984, we introduced the first mass market electronic payment system intended to replace manual credit card authorization devices for small merchants. VeriFone, Inc. operated as a publicly-traded company from 1990 until it was acquired in 1997 by Hewlett-Packard, which operated it as a division. In July 2001, HP sold VeriFone, Inc. to Gores Technology Group, LLC, a privately held acquisition and investment management firm. In July 2002, VeriFone, Inc. was recapitalized and VeriFone Systems, Inc. (formerly known as VeriFone Holdings, Inc.), a Delaware corporation, was organized as a holding company for VeriFone, Inc. In connection with the recapitalization, certain investment funds affiliated with GTCR Golder Rauner, LLC, a private equity firm, became our majority stockholders. VeriFone completed its initial public offering on May 4, 2005. In June 2009, the GTCR-affiliated funds ceased to be beneficial owners of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock.
Our business has grown through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. For instance, in December 2015, we acquired InterCard AG, a leading payment service provider in Germany, and in February 2016, we acquired AJB Software Design, a provider of payment gateway and switching solutions for large merchants in the U.S. and Canada.
We are headquartered in San Jose, California and sell into more than 150 countries worldwide, with a direct presence in approximately 40 countries.
Our Business Strategy
Verifone’s strategy is to deliver payment solutions that combine next-generation devices that are connected to our services network to enable the future of payments and commerce. We seek to provide innovative payment and value-added commerce solutions globally to merchants and the institutions that serve them, such as financial institutions, merchant acquirers and point-of-sale integrators, on a worldwide basis. Our solutions enable payment and commerce in a variety of environments, including traditional multilane and countertop implementations, self-service or unattended environments, portable deployments, mobile point-of-sale solutions, as well as fully integrated point of sale solutions. Our solutions include electronic payment devices; field services such as installation, repair and warranty; and software such as estate management, security and gateway services. We recently introduced Verifone Engage, our new family of interactive, commerce-enabled payment devices that we believe offer a new and innovative connected payments experience. We have also recently launched Verifone Carbon 8 and 10, an integrated dual-screen cloud-based point-of-sale solution, that enables merchants to run register and business applications from a tablet-sized screen while enabling consumers to pay and interact with a smaller consumer-facing screen. We believe we have one of the leading electronic payment solutions brands and are one of the largest providers of electronic payment and commerce solutions worldwide.
Services continue to be important to our business strategy. During fiscal year 2018, we intend to expand our footprint of connected network endpoints and extend the payment and commerce services into additional devices. In order to provide a broader range of services as part of our solutions, we also seek to connect our terminal systems back to our network, which enables us to leverage a connected network of terminals in our services offerings. We offer a wide portfolio of services, ranging from traditional terminal- related support services and value-added transaction payment services to commerce enablement solutions that are designed to 
 4

facilitate commerce opportunities for merchants. Our traditional terminal-related support services include professional services related to installation and deployment, helpdesk support, training, equipment repair and maintenance, and software post-contract support. Our value-added transaction services include terminal management services and gateway solutions that enable more efficient routing of transactions, multi-channel acceptance and processing, along with end-to-end encryption to reduce the complexity and costs of Payment Card Industry, or PCI, standards compliance. Our commerce enablement solutions leverage our terminals to engage consumers at the point of sale through value-added applications such as loyalty and couponing applications, targeted offers and real-time reward redemptions. We believe that consumer engagement at the point of sale provides opportunities to increase brand awareness and potential for merchants to grow sales. We intend to provide applications to merchants who have connected to our gateways that improve the efficiency in the way that they run their businesses. We also intend to launch a commerce enablement platform that links smart terminals and technology gateways in order to provide our clients with integrated tools to enhance and enrich the commerce experience at the point of sale, as well as improve their back office efficiency.
We believe continued innovation in terminal solutions, strategic expansion of our value-added services in key markets, including both developed and emerging markets, and investment in our payments and commerce enablement solutions are important components of our business strategy. We intend to focus on our solutions as a key driver of growth globally, including emphasis on growing the number of devices connected to our gateways. We also intend to focus our efforts on expanding our business in new geographic markets for us such as Japan and expanding our presence in emerging markets such as India and Indonesia and in new market segments such as hospitality, quick-service restaurant and pay-at-the-table in the United States.
Our Business Organization
During fiscal year 2017, we managed our business as a single business unit, Verifone Solutions, which is focused on delivering seamless and simple-to-implement solutions that are integrated with our services offerings, including our device, payment, commerce and security-related services offerings. Within Verifone Solutions, we have two global product lines: Verifone Systems and Verifone Services. Verifone Systems delivers point of sale electronic payment devices that run our unique operating systems, security and encryption software, and certified payment software for both payments and commerce. Verifone Services delivers device- related leasing and maintenance, payment transaction routing and reporting, and commerce-based services such as advertising on digital screens. For segment and geographic information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Segment Results of Operations, Note 1, Principles of Consolidation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14, Segment and Geographic Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our Industry Trends
The electronic payment solutions industry encompasses systems, software, and services that enable the acceptance and processing of electronic payments for goods and services, enable commerce and provide other value-added functionality at the point of sale. The electronic payment system is an important part of the payment infrastructure, serving as the interface between consumers and merchants at the point of sale, as well as the link between the consumer transaction at the point of sale and the payment transaction processing infrastructure.
The global payments industry continues to move towards electronic payment transactions. Consumer habits continue to shift to higher volumes of non-cash transactions with demand for additional payment options. In developed markets, such as the U.S., the continued shift to electronic payments is characterized by an increasing volume of transactions, including an increase in volume of low value card transactions, through multiple payment forms. Our industry continues to move toward advanced payment technologies and methods, and has also seen the emergence of new market entrants, including outside the traditional point of sale providers. Certain regions, such as parts of Europe, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific, currently have relatively low rates of electronic payments, but are experiencing a growing number of such transactions. The adoption of electronic payments in emerging markets is driven primarily by economic growth, infrastructure development, expanding presence of Internet and wireless connectivity and support from governments seeking to modernize their economies and to encourage electronic payment transactions as a means of driving commerce and improving tax collection. In some emerging markets, the trend toward non-cash transactions is driving 
 5

the need for innovative solutions to address access barriers to large populations of consumers who are not using or able to use the banking and financial systems.
Security continues to be a driving factor in our industry. Payment transaction security needs to become increasingly sophisticated as security threats become more sophisticated, as new payment methods, especially mobile payments, are introduced, and as payment transaction volumes increase. Further, new payment types and platforms make payment transactions more operationally complex and thus exacerbate security concerns and increase the need for security solutions. In the last few years, a number of retailers and banks reported customer or client data breaches and other fraudulent activities, which heightened awareness of data security and increased demand for security solutions in payments systems, including accelerating the adoption of EMV, a Europay, MasterCard and Visa chip based card acceptance payment method, which became the payment standard in other countries. In addition to offering products that are independently certified to meet security standards, we provide secure commerce architecture as well as transaction encryption and tokenization services to facilitate an end-to-end security solution for payments. Our security solutions must continue to evolve to meet changing needs and threats.
We anticipate that the industry will see growing demand for mobile and portable point of sale solutions. In recent years, the increased use of wireless Internet connectivity driven by expanded network coverage, faster communication speeds and reduced costs has driven demand for compact, easy-to-use, and reliable mobile point of sale, or mPOS, payment solutions. We expect rising demand for mPOS devices, including increasing utilization of smartphones and tablets based on the Apple iOS, Google Android, and Microsoft Windows operating systems to conduct payment transactions and to enable new mobile retailing solutions for merchants. Wireless portable devices and mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are also increasingly being used as multi-purpose hardware and integrated software platforms that are being adopted for commerce, payments, and complementary applications, and tablet-based point of sale systems are becoming more common as all-in-one merchant management systems.
Portable and mobile devices may have shorter technology refresh cycles than traditional electronic payment devices. In particular, major telecommunications carriers around the world are phasing out their 2G/GPRS networks in favor of faster and more advanced technologies, such as 3G or later-generation networks.
We expect continued advancement in payment technologies driven by demand for payment solutions that accommodate different payment methods, such as EMV and near field communications, or NFC, and across multiple channels while maintaining a consistent consumer experience. Technological innovation in the payments industry continues to advance as indicated by the emergence and adoption of new payment methods, such as contactless, NFC, and mobile cloud-based payments, including card not present options. We believe that security concerns driven by a number of recent high-profile security breaches at major retailers and banks continues to drive demand for EMV solutions in the United States. Electronic payment methods such as, Apple Pay, whereby consumers are able to use their smartphones to make payments by tapping their phones on a point of sale terminal, such as ours, have increased visibility into NFC which may spur more adoption of NFC, particularly as NFC transactions are considered EMV compliant. We are also working with PayPal, Google, Samsung and other partners to increase the acceptance of digital wallets at large retailers across the U.S. through our NFC-enabled devices. We also believe the potential adoption of EMV in Japan may create new opportunities for us.
Overall, merchants are striving to enrich the consumer experience and to accommodate consumer expectations for payment flexibility by offering a variety of payment options and other value-added services at the point of sale. Merchants increasingly seek more sophisticated tools integrated with payment systems that enable a consistent and seamless experience for consumers across multiple delivery channels, both online and offline. We expect this trend to create a need for a single platform that can support different payment options and delivery channels, and that is offered on a managed service basis to reduce risk and time to market. With the continued emergence of new and innovative technologies, our markets have become increasingly complex, which has in turn driven increasing interest by merchants to outsource managed services solutions such as terminal estate management, gateway transaction services, and payment systems implementation and management.
We expect merchants to increasingly seek to have rich and dynamic interactions with consumers. Customized relevant content at the point of sale, such as promotions, offers, coupons, merchandise suggestions and loyalty programs, offer a means to enrich the consumer experience, particularly in retail and hospitality environments. The time between the initiation and completion of a 
 6

transaction on a media-enabled payment solution provides merchants the opportunity to engage with consumers. Furthermore, incorporation of emerging technologies, such as Bluetooth low energy, or BLE, and beacons into payment solutions provides consumers with a more personalized experience, while merchants benefit from enhanced ways to engage customers in the store and to streamline the consumer shopping experience across channels.
We expect clients in more price sensitive markets to demand more options for lower cost payments solutions. In price sensitive markets, which include many higher growth markets in Asia, more clients have sought lower cost payment solution options, in many cases including the flexibility for the client to forgo certain features and enhancements but nevertheless have a leading edge payment solution. This trend has increased competition in these markets as clients place less emphasis on branding and added features and enhancements that may otherwise differentiate competing products, and rely primarily on pricing for purchase decisions. While pricing has become a key factor, clients nevertheless seek payment solutions with certain innovative technological features, such as contactless or portability options, and mobile payment solutions that leverage the connectivity of smartphones and tablets, and therefore solutions providers must continue to innovate to address specific market needs while maintaining lower costs.
We expect compliance requirements and regulatory mandates applicable to our industry will continue to expand. Compliance requirements include government regulations related to the prevention of identity theft, as well as operating regulation safeguards issued by the credit and debit card associations. The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) oversees and unifies industry standards, known as PCI standards, to enhance payment card data security and serve as a framework for the safe handling of cardholder information. These standards continually evolve to become more stringent and increasingly dependent on complex measures to protect all payment related data. Compliance requirements and regulatory mandates continue to evolve to accommodate new payment types and related security concerns.
Our products and solutions generally must be certified against applicable payment industry requirements and mandates. The continual evolution of industry security standards drives recertification and replacement of electronic payment systems. In addition to meeting the PCI standards, additional governmental regulations over payment card data security may apply and require separate local certifications in certain non-U.S. countries, such as Australia and Brazil. Certain other countries also have their own set of compliance and certification requirements for payment card data security, including Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Furthermore, in order for our products to be allowed to connect to payment networks, we must obtain certification of the relevant products and solutions with card associations, financial institutions, and payment processors and comply with local government and telecommunications regulations. Some of these certification processes may take up to twelve months to complete. See Item 1, Business-Industry Standards and Government Regulations, for a more detailed description of these standards and regulations.
Products and Services
Our System Solutions
Our system solutions consist of point of sale electronic payment devices that run both our unique operating system and Android, security and encryption software, and certified payment software. Verifone's systems solutions are designed to suit our clients' needs in a variety of environments, including traditional multilane and countertop implementations, self-service and unattended environments, in-vehicle and portable deployments, mobile point-of-sale solutions, as well as fully integrated iPOS solutions.

Countertop and PIN pads
Designed with merchant and consumer needs in mind, our suite of countertop solutions incorporate compact design, easy installation and consumer-friendly features. Our countertop solutions accept a wide variety of payment options, including contactless, NFC, mobile wallets, and EMV, and support a range of applications, such as pre-paid products, including gift cards and loyalty programs. We also supply secure PIN pads that support credit and debit card, EBT, EMV, and other PIN-based transactions, and include multiple connectivity options and NFC capability. Our countertop solutions support a wide range of certified applications that are either built into electronic payment systems or connect to electronic cash registers, or ECRs, and point of sale systems.
Multilane
Our multilane consumer facing commerce devices are designed to allow merchants, particularly in the multi-lane retail environment, to engage in direct consumer interaction through customized multimedia content, in-store promotions, digital offers, and other value-added services using a point of sale device. With these devices, the merchant is able to enrich the customer experience while enabling new merchant revenue opportunities. These products offer features that are important to servicing customers in a multi-lane retail environment, such as user-friendly interfaces, ECR compatibility, durable key pads, multimedia displays and signature capture functionality. Our solutions also support these same features in self-service market segments such as taxis, parking lots/garages, ticketing machines, vending machines, gas pumps, self-checkouts, and quick service restaurants.
Portable and Mobile
Our portable payment devices consist of small, portable, handheld devices that enable merchants to accept electronic payments wherever wireless connectivity is available, and our mobile solutions offer secure mobile payment capabilities for all segments of the mobile point of sale, or mPOS, environment, from large retailers to small merchants, and include devices that attach to, and interface with, iOS, or Android-based smartphones and tablets, enabling these devices to be used as a secure payment device by merchants. Increasingly, clients look for portable options whether to enable electronic payments in new environments or to augment traditional point of sale or ECR environments. Our portable and mobile devices are designed to meet these needs, offering PCI compliant solutions that securely accept a variety of payment types, and providing merchants with increased flexibility to enrich the overall consumer experience whether in or out of the traditional bricks and mortar store location. We expect that market demand for portable and mobile options will continue to grow, particularly in developing countries where wireless and mobile telecommunications networks are being deployed at a much faster rate than wireline networks. We have deployed our portable and mobile solutions in a number of merchant environments, including for retail, restaurant, hospitality, transportation, and delivery businesses where merchants and consumers desire portability but demand secure payment systems to reduce fraud and identity theft.

Transaction Payment Services
Our transaction payment services are hosted and managed by us and offered as a subscription-based model that provide clients with the flexibility to outsource a select set of payment operation services and solutions to be managed by us. Our range of services and solutions includes terminal services such as terminal rental and related installation, deployment, on-site terminal servicing, and hardware repair services, as well as gateway transaction payment services such as transaction routing, transaction acceptance processing, transaction reporting, remote device management, and payment value-added services using the client’s choice of processor. Our solutions serve as a platform for deployment of additional value-added programs. Further, our hosted transaction payment service covers 24x7 support, encrypted transactions, integration of new payment methods, ongoing EMV maintenance, merchant support, and PCI compliance, with the aim of reducing operational complexity and costs for clients. Clients also have the option to enable processing of payment types across different channels of a merchant’s business, including credit and debit card payments, online payments for e-commerce applications and mobile platforms. Clients can select full service or other options that meet their immediate business needs, and adjust their subscription service packages to more advanced features and functions as their businesses grow or as the payment industry evolves. We anticipate that outsourcing of payment operations may become more attractive to clients as payment complexity and cost of payment operations increase.
We also offer server-based software that allows merchants to integrate advanced payment functionality into PC-based and other retail systems seamlessly. These products handle the business logic steps related to an electronic payment transaction (credit, debit, gift, and loyalty), including collection of payment-related information from the consumer and merchant, and communication with payment processors for authorization and settlement. These solutions also enable the functionality of peripherals that connect to PC-based electronic payment systems, including consumer-facing products such as secure PIN pads and signature capture devices. Our PAYware software product line, consisting of server-based, enterprise payment software solutions, now includes card acceptance and merchant acquiring solutions, point of sale integration software, value-added payment solutions, and card management systems.
Commerce Services
Omnicommerce
Verifone intends to expand its omnichannel commerce solutions to its global payments and commerce clients who are moving away from single or silo channeled commerce solutions. Omni-channel commerce requires the integration and inter-operability of all card-present and card-not-present solutions. Verifone helps our clients navigate this complexity by integrating Verifone’s next-generation devices with our payment gateways, tokenization engine, and reporting capabilities into a single solution. Clients can then take advantage of our ability to provide a single payments and commerce solution across all sales channels, including mobile, PIN, point of sale, and online transactions. By processing customer transactions through our gateway network, clients gain visibility across sales channels and can provide enhanced and integrated customer experiences. Our tokenization engine, which replaces sensitive card data with a unique digital identifier (a “token”), can be used to generate or retrieve tokens to match transactions with a common card. These tokens can retrieve, access, and analyze purchase data for customers repeatedly using a common payment instrument.
Cloud-Based Managed Services
Verifone offers a wide range of cloud-based managed services that connect our clients with tools that accommodate their business needs and plans. Our cloud-based managed services connect our clients to secure cloud-based transaction processing that is consolidated across payment types. Verifone's cloud-connected software services include remote loading of supported devices with updates for base files and firmware, software and applications. Our cloud-based estate management services provides remote key loading, capabilities to remotely activate contactless, NFC and EMV payment methods, and consolidated reporting and analytics. PAYware Connect, our cloud-based hosted payment solution, consolidates all payment transactions through our payment gateway and enables merchants to process from any internet-connected PC through a single portal. PAYware Connect uses our 
 10

proprietary VeriShield Total Protect for end-to-end transaction encryption and tokenization and is certified by all of the major payment processing networks. In addition, Verifone intends to offer a cloud-based, commerce app marketplace called Merchant Marketplace to certain merchants who are connected through Verifone’s terminal management solutions. With the Merchant Marketplace, merchants and acquirers can customize the point of sale by downloading third-party or proprietary apps. Commerce enablers can use these apps to improve business operations with enhanced functionality, such as inventory and reporting features, or to personalize the shopping experience with loyalty rewards and product recommendations. These cloud-based solutions are offered globally to retailers, acquirers and merchants in the restaurant and hospitality markets who can host the solution on their own servers, but are also available as part of an omni-channel payments solution hosted by us.
Terminal Management Solutions
Verifone connects our next-generation of devices to the cloud and enables omnicommerce through our proprietary terminal management solution, VHQ. VHQ both connects our devices to our expanded services and enables efficient management of an entire estate of devices with minimal on-site intervention. These estate management services are targeted to retailers, financial institutions, processors with helpdesk operations, and device maintenance companies, and are available for a variety of environments, including retail, healthcare, transit, quick service restaurants and financial services. VHQ connects the devices within a merchant's estate to back office operations, enabling secure and remote deployment of software to point of sale terminals, centralized estate tracking, monitoring and diagnostics, and consolidated information collection and management reports. These integrated device services broaden and enhance Verifone’s service relationship with its clients by enabling rapid device deployment and improved device uptime through remote and predictive maintenance.
Libraries and Development Tools
We make a broad portfolio of application libraries and development tools available to our large community of internal and third-party application developers, including certain pre-certified software libraries that can be integrated into third-party applications without the need for further card brand certifications. We provide a set of application libraries, or programming modules such as smart card interfaces, contactless card and NFC phone interfaces, and communications drivers with defined programming interfaces that facilitate the implementation of our multi-application system solutions. Further, we maintain application compatibility, including use of standardized application programming interfaces, also known as APIs, and service calls, designed to facilitate the migration of applications to future system solutions.
We also provide developer tool kits that contain industry standard visual development environments (C/C++) along with platform-specific compilers and debuggers. We provide a broad range of support services for our application development communities, including developer training, a dedicated developers' support team, and Verifone DevNet, an online developers' portal that provides registered developers access to libraries, tools, programming guides, and technical support. Our libraries, developer tool kits, training, and support systems facilitate the rapid growth in deployment of third-party, value-added applications for our system solutions.
We believe that this growing portfolio of value-added applications increases the attractiveness of our solutions to global financial institutions and payment processors by adding services beyond payment transaction processing. We seek to encourage innovation on our terminal platform and intend to encourage continued development of applications for our system solutions.
Customers
Globally, our clients consist primarily of financial institutions, payment processors, large retailers, petroleum companies, transportation companies, government organizations, healthcare companies and quick service restaurants. We also sell payment processing services directly to smaller merchants and retailers. We also sell through third party partners, such as banks and acquirers, system integrators, and independent sales organizations, and channel partners that distribute and resell our products.

The percentage of net revenues from our ten largest clients is as follows:

 | Years Ended October 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Percentage of net revenues from our ten largest clients | 19.4 | % | | 19.9 | % | 20.2 | %

Historically, we have experienced fluctuations of orders from clients based on the timing of client technology refresh cycles and/or client capital expenditure decisions, which typically drive larger volume orders. Timing of such cycles from larger clients, such as large retailers and processors, could cause our net revenues and results of operations to vary from period to period. In addition, the timing of adoption of new technologies, such as EMV in the U.S., and timing of releases of regulatory and industry standards, such as PCI standards, as well as releases of new product introductions can significantly impact net revenues, cost of net revenues and operating expenses. Net revenues from both direct clients and our third-party distributors may decline pending an upcoming standards change or in anticipation of a standards change or new product introduction. However, neither historical patterns of net revenues nor timing of net revenues related to releases of new standards or products should be considered reliable indicators of our future net revenues, results of operations or financial performance.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products worldwide through our direct sales force and through third-party distributors and partners. Internationally, we rely on distributors to represent us in countries or geographies where we do not have a direct presence. As we continue to focus on services, we expect a shift to more direct sales and support personnel.
Our sales personnel consist of sales representatives, business development personnel, sales engineers, and customer service representatives with specific vertical market expertise. Our sales teams are supported by client services, manufacturing, product development, and marketing teams to deliver products and services that meet the needs of our diverse client base. Our marketing personnel include product marketing personnel, account managers, program marketing personnel, and corporate communications and public relations personnel.
As of October 31, 2017, we had 939 sales and marketing employees, representing approximately 16.8% of our total workforce.
Competition
The markets for our solutions are highly competitive. We compete based on various factors, including product functions and features, product availability and certifications, product quality and reliability, design innovation, interoperability with third-party systems, service offerings, support, brand reputation and pricing. We continue to experience intense competition from traditional point of sale terminal providers for both systems solutions and services. In addition, we have seen some competitors introduce increasingly aggressive pricing for terminal solutions, particularly in certain emerging markets. We also see new companies entering our markets, including entrants offering some form of mobile-device based payment solution as well as low-cost entrants. Some of our competitors may be more established, benefit from greater local recognition in particular countries, and have greater resources within those countries than we do. Finally, certain of our distributor partners may also offer similar services that we strive to offer to our end merchants.
Competition from manufacturers, distributors, or providers of products and services similar to or competitive with our system solutions or services could result in lower market share, price reductions, reduced margins, or could render our solutions obsolete. Some smaller local electronic payment terminal vendors, particularly in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, have also introduced pricing pressures in their markets by offering substantially lower prices. In addition, a number of the financial institutions and payment processors to whom we market our products typically adopt a dual vendor approach for the supply of their point of sale terminals.

We expect to continue to experience significant competition in the future. We compete globally with suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors of electronic payment systems and services as well as suppliers of ECRs that provide built-in electronic payment capabilities and producers of software that facilitates electronic payments over the Internet. Our primary competitors in these markets for point of sale terminals and services include Ingenico S.A., PAX Technology, Ltd., Fujian Newland, Square, SZZT Electronics Co. Ltd., Shenzhen Xinguodu, Equinox Payments, CyberNet Inc., and Spire Payments Ltd. We also compete with NCR Corporation and Oracle Corporation. In addition, we face vigorous competition from smaller companies that have been able to develop strong local or regional customer bases.
As we focus on specialty services and increase our emphasis on mobile and full service solutions, as well as on small to medium sized enterprises, we face new competitors, including those who in the past targeted merchants that were not traditionally our clients or those who offer competing technologies, such as mobile-based payment dongles or electronic wallets. We believe these competitors are targeting merchants that are our clients.
Most of our clients are large, sophisticated organizations that have significant purchasing power and seek innovative solutions from trusted brands. We believe that we benefit from a number of competitive advantages gained through our more than 35-year history. These advantages include our globally trusted brand name, large installed base, significant involvement in the development of industry standards, security infrastructure, global operating scale, customizable platforms, and investment in research and development. Additionally, we compete primarily on the basis of the following key factors: end-to-end system solutions, industry leading security, product certifications, value-added applications and advanced product features, advanced communications modularity, reliability, supply chain scale and flexibility, and low total cost of ownership.
We expect competition in our industry will be driven by the requirements to respond to increasingly complex and evolving technology, industry certifications, and security standards and requirements, as well as market demands for innovative and flexible payment solution options. We also see the prospect of continued consolidation among suppliers of electronic payment systems as they seek to enhance their capability to carry out research and development and seek other efficiencies, such as in procurement and manufacturing. The rapid technological and other changes in the payments industry have led to increased competition from new technologies and competitors both within and outside our traditional industry.

Industry Standards and Government Regulations
In order to offer products that connect to payment networks, electronic payment system providers must certify their products and services with card associations, financial institutions, and payment processors, as well as comply with government and telecommunications company regulations.
The following are key standards and requirements that apply to our industry:
Security Standards
Compliance with industry and government security standards are implemented to ensure the integrity of the electronic payment process and protect the privacy of consumers using electronic payment systems. We design our product security architecture to meet the applicable Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) established requirements.
Card Association Standards
Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. Formed in 2006, the PCI SSC develops standards and supporting materials that enhance payment card data security and serve as a framework for the safe handling and protection of cardholder information. The following are the PCI SSC principal standards applicable to our industry:

• | Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) provides a specifications framework for the payment card data environment security including, but not limited to, the policies and processes providing the framework for the prevention, detection, and appropriate reaction to security incidents.


• | Payment Card Industry Personal Identification Number (PCI PIN) - provides requirements for the secure management, processing and transmission of Personal Identification Number (PIN) during payment card transaction processing at point-of-sale (POS) terminals, encrypting PIN pads, and unattended payment terminals. PCI PIN requirements apply to organizations involved with handling of PIN data including processing, PIN translation, and/or key management.


• | Payment Card Industry PIN Transaction Security (PTS) provides vendors and manufacturers with the requirements for PIN terminals, including point of sale devices, encrypting PIN pads, and unattended payment terminals.


• | Payment Application Data Security Standard provides a set of standards to help software vendors and others develop secure payment applications.


• | Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) provides a set of requirements for vendors, assessors, and point-to-point encryption solution providers to validate their solutions. P2PE certified solutions may help a merchant reduce the scope of their PCI DSS assessments when using a validated P2PE solution for account data acceptance and processing.

EMV Standards. EMV standards are intended to address the growing need for transaction security and interoperability, and are designed to ensure global smart card interoperability across all electronic payment systems. To ensure adherence to this standard, specific certifications are required for all electronic payment systems and their application software. We maintain EMV certifications across our applicable product lines. EMV has already been adopted in many countries outside the U.S., and the adoption of EMV in the U.S. commenced in 2015. EMV is also expected to be adopted in additional countries in the near-term, such as Japan.
Contactless and NFC System Standards. The major card associations have each established a brand around contactless payment, for example, PayPass for MasterCard, Visa payWave and Visa Wave for Visa, ExpressPay for American Express, ZIP for Discover Financial Services, and J/speedy for JCB. Each contactless payment brand has a complete set of specifications, certification requirements and a highly controlled testing and approval process. In addition to EMVCo standards, there are also regional 
 14

specification and certification and other payment scheme requirements for contactless such as Geldkarte in Germany, and Carte Bancaire in France.
MasterCard PTS and TQM Program. The MasterCard PTS program identifies and addresses stability and security of communications between Internet-enabled point of sale terminals and the acquirer host system using authentication/encryption protocols approved by MasterCard ensuring transaction data integrity. We have successfully achieved VX product-line compliance with the MasterCard PTS security specification regarding security of Internet connected payment systems. As of May 2010, the MasterCard PTS program was subsumed into a PCI SSC PTS 3.x program known as the Open Protocols module. The Open Protocols module addresses point of sale devices that are Internet, WIFI, or GPRS enabled to make sure they are secure. The MasterCard PTS program compliance applies to several of our Internet-enabled products including the VX Evolution series payment systems. The MasterCard TQM (Terminal Quality Management) program was created in 2003 to help ensure the quality and reliability of EMV compliant terminals worldwide. MasterCard's TQM program validates the entire life cycle of the product, from design to manufacturing and deployment, and is in addition to the EMV Level 1 certification. We maintain TQM approval across all EMV Level 1 approved products deployed with EMV applications. The TQM program is now extended to contactless payment systems and is a requirement for achieving a full PayPass approval with MasterCard.
Payment Processor/Financial Institution Requirements
U.S. payment processors have two types of certification levels: (1) Class B certification, which ensures that an electronic payment system adheres to the payment processor's basic functional and network requirements; and (2) Class A certification, which adds another stipulation that the processor actively supports the electronic payment system on its internal helpdesk systems. Attainment of Class A certification, which may take up to twelve months, requires working with each payment processor to pass extensive functional and end-user testing and to establish the help desk related infrastructure necessary to provide Class A support. Attaining Class A certifications increases the number of payment processors that may actively sell and deploy a particular electronic payment system.
Other Regulatory Authorities
Our products must comply with government regulations, including those imposed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the FCC) and similar telecommunications authorities worldwide regarding emissions, radiation, safety, and connections with telephone lines and radio networks. Our products must also comply with recommendations of quasi-regulatory authorities and of standards-setting committees. Our electronic payment systems have been certified as compliant with a large number of national requirements, including those of the FCC and Underwriters Laboratory in the U.S. and similar local requirements in other countries. In addition, wireless network service providers mandate certain standards and certifications applicable to connected devices and systems that operate on their networks. Our wireless electronic payment systems have been certified by certain leading wireless carrier networks around the world.
We are also subject to various other legal and regulatory requirements related to the manufacture and sale of our products, such as the U.S. regulations which require us to implement a management system to evaluate and report on the existence of conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in our supply chain, the European Union (EU) directive that places restrictions on the use of hazardous substances (RoHS and RoHS2) in electronic equipment, the EU directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), and the EU's Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). RoHS and RoHS2 set a framework for producers' obligations in relation to manufacturing (including the amounts of named hazardous substances contained in products sold) and WEEE sets a framework for treatment, labeling, recovery, and recycling of electronic products in the European Union. REACH imposes chemicals regulation and controls including requirements for registration of chemicals on the EU market.
Foreign Operations
For our fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, our international net revenues accounted for 66.4% and 59.5%, respectively, of our total net revenues. Margins on our sales of products in foreign countries and on sales of our products generally, which 
 15

include components sourced from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and other applicable duties. See “Foreign Currency Transaction Risk” under Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In certain regions outside the U.S., we rely on third-party distributors to market and sell our products in accordance with our policies for promotional efforts and maintenance of adequate technical expertise with respect to our products, and with our requirements for compliance with applicable laws, including for example, trade regulations applicable to our products and anti-corruption laws. Although we generally have contractual relationships with these third parties, if such third parties do not comply with our requirements, we face potential liability, harm to our brand reputation, and disruptions to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We outsource our product manufacturing to various suppliers in the Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) industry. Our primary EMS providers are located in China, Singapore, Malaysia, Brazil, and Germany. For several of our product lines, we directly ship from our EMS providers to our clients in various countries around the world. Substantially all of our products contain key components that are obtained from foreign sources. These concentrations in external and foreign sources of supply present risks of interruption for reasons beyond our control, including political and other uncertainties. See “Manufacturing Agreements” in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion about the risks that we face related to our foreign operations.
Proprietary Rights
We rely primarily on copyrights, trademarks, patent filings, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products. We maintain a patent incentive program and patent committee, which encourages and rewards employees to present inventions for patent application and filings.
As of October 31, 2017, we held 295 patents and 73 patent applications filed with various patent offices throughout the world, including the U.S., China, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, among other countries. These patents and patent applications include utility patents, utility models and designs acquired in connection with our acquisitions. We believe that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products which generally are expected to be shorter than the terms of our patents due to continual technical innovations in our industry.
We use the Verifone name and logo globally as an important part of the branding of our company and our products, and we register these trademarks in the key jurisdictions where we do business, including the U.S. and the EU. As of October 31, 2017, we held trademark registration in 24 jurisdictions (including registration in the European Union that covers a number of country level registrations we had previously filed) for the “VERIFONE” trademark and in 31 jurisdictions (including registration in the EU that covers a number of country level registrations we had previously filed) for the VERIFONE trademark including our ribbon logo. A new VERIFONE logo was filed in the U.S. and was recently granted (on July 16, 2016). We currently hold trademark registration in the U.S. and a variety of other countries for our product names and other marks.
We generally have not registered copyrights in our software and other written works. Instead, we have relied upon common law copyright, customer license agreements, and other forms of protection. We use non-disclosure agreements and license agreements to protect software and other written materials as copyrighted and/or trade secrets.
In the U.S. and other countries, prior to 2001, our predecessor held patents relating to a variety of POS technology and related inventions, which expire in accordance with the applicable law in the country where filed. In 2001, as part of the divestiture of Verifone, Inc. from HP, Verifone, Inc. and HP entered into a technology agreement whereby HP retained ownership of most of the patents owned or applied for by Verifone prior to the date of divestiture. The technology agreement grants Verifone a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use any of the patented technology retained by HP, Inc. at no charge.
 16

Employees
As of October 31, 2017, we had approximately 5,600 employees worldwide. We have collective bargaining agreements with our employees in France, Spain, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and Brazil and with some in Germany. Our employees in France, Norway, Sweden, and some in Germany are represented by works councils that have the right to certain information and to participate in certain operational decisions affecting the represented employees, such as relocation of office facilities, compensation and benefits, and working hours. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that we have good employee relations and relationships with the collective bargaining groups and works councils.
