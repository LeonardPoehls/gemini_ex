Our Products
InvisibleShield Products
InvisibleShield products are designed to provide premium, lifetime protection for mobile device screens against shattering or scratching through military-grade solutions. Our products are designed to provide peace of mind by enabling consumers to fearlessly enjoy their mobile devices and never experience the inconvenience of a shattered screen.
InvisibleShield is focused on producing industry-leading screen and device protection. Our protective film and glass products offer consumers a wide array of protection types and features, all with a limited lifetime warranty.
Our InvisibleShield films were originally developed to protect the leading edge of rotary blades on military helicopters. Through constant innovation, we continue to formulate new films that are designed to offer the highest standards in self-healing scratch and impact protection. We also continue to drive innovation around simplifying the customer application experience like we’ve done with our EZ Apply® tabs, which are designed to help users align and apply InvisibleShield products. We also provide custom-fit screen protection for thousands of device types through our automated InvisibleShield On Demand (“ISOD”) solution. With ISOD, retailers can supply consumers with screen protection for nearly any device model, all without having to hold excess inventory.
Launched during the first quarter of 2014, InvisibleShield Glass is designed to provide premium screen protection and clarity, along with a superior feel and universally compatible touch sensitivity. In the third quarter of 2016 we announced InvisibleShield Glass+, designed to provide additional scratch resistance and impact protection over InvisibleShield Glass.
ZAGG has the leading market share in screen protection, and has maintained that leading position by consistently delivering innovative products to the market.

The eclectic selection of earbuds and headphones specifically targeted a younger demographic while still appealing to a wide spectrum of consumers. We continue to innovate and expand our headphone and earbud product lines under the IFROGZ name to include offerings for all ages under both the EarPollution and IFROGZ brands. In 2013, we began offering IFROGZ portable Bluetooth speakers for music lovers on the move that combine impressive audio quality, clever functionality, and eye-catching design. In the third quarter of 2016, we introduced a new family of wireless Bluetooth audio products designed to combine outstanding sound with a lightweight listening experience by alleviating bulky earbuds and heavy control modules.
ZAGG Products
Products under the ZAGG brand are designed to empower people to live their lives unleashed. Mobility is changing everything and ZAGG is driving the mobile lifestyle forward with products that are designed to allow consumers to be productive and connected at work, at play and at rest. ZAGG products which include keyboards, cases, and social tech are designed to free consumers from the confines of the traditional workplace. We believe “getting away” shouldn’t mean being disconnected. We support the communicators, commuters, creators and closers who live a mobile lifestyle.
Our ZAGG products are designed to feature cutting-edge design and innovation to provide portability, style, and productivity that can keep up with even the most active mobile users. We believe that with the right mobile accessories, no one ever has to feel tethered or held back.
ZAGG keyboards are designed to offer consumers an enhanced and innovative productivity experience. Since entering this category in 2010, ZAGG has continually reinvented its line of keyboards while also providing timely, curated solutions for new devices released by Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung, as well as other leading mobile device manufacturers. In addition to device-specific keyboards and folio keyboard cases, ZAGG’s line of universal full-size Bluetooth® keyboards are designed to be compatible with virtually any device and mobile operating system. We continue to innovate and expand our wireless keyboard product lines as end users’ requirements evolve in this rapidly changing market segment.
Strategy
At ZAGG, our focus is to (1) design creative product solutions for users of mobile devices, (2) sell these products to consumers through targeted global distribution partners and online, (3) drive operational excellence across the organization, and (4) become the preferred brand through emphasizing innovation and product-quality, providing excellent customer service, and focusing on the end-users’ experience with our products. We focus our corporate, team, and individual goals to accomplish these overall corporate objectives.
We plan to continue to expand our product offerings, including entering new product categories and entering new domestic and global markets that we believe will be consistent with our overall corporate strategy.
Design and Packaging
We design our InvisibleShield glass and film products for application on thousands of specific electronic devices. Our logistics partners acquire precision-cut raw materials from exclusive third-party suppliers. These precision-cut InvisibleShield film and glass either use the EZ Apply tabs installation or are packaged with an installation kit consisting of a moisture adhesive-activating solution, a squeegee, and instructions for application on specific electronic devices. We have established relationships with package assembly, shipping, and logistics 
3

companies worldwide that we expect will allow us to expand production and shipping capacity for InvisibleShield film as well as glass production as we continue to grow and enter new markets.
We also customize each InvisibleShield film cut design for the specific electronic device and currently have thousands of unique designs. Each cut design is developed internally and is owned exclusively by us. We do not own the patent for the raw materials, which is held by our exclusive supplier. Our film supplier has contractually agreed to not sell the base materials to any of our competitors. We believe that our relationship with the manufacturer of the raw material is on excellent terms and anticipate no interruption in our ability to acquire adequate supplies of raw materials and produce products.
We manufacture our other mobile device accessories (InvisibleShield glass, keyboards, keyboard cases, audio products, cases, power cases, mobile power solutions, wireless charging solutions, and other accessories) using third party contract manufacturers located primarily in Asia. We have established relationships with third-party manufacturers, package assembly, warehousing, shipping, and logistics companies that allow us to expand our accessories production and shipping capacity as we continue to grow our current customer base and enter new markets.
For all our products, we design the exterior packaging to ensure it is consistent with the overall marketing strategy and is consistent with the desires of our major retailer partners. We have designed the hard plastic and cardboard box packaging to be informative and attractive for point-of-sale displays. We outsource the production of packaging to various independent third parties.
Market for Products
Portable electronic devices, notably handheld devices, continue to advance in performance and functionality. Furthermore, the market is expanding as evidenced by continued innovative new product releases, particularly in tablets and smartphones. Correspondingly, the aesthetics of such devices are increasingly important as buyers typically consider the look and feel of such devices, as much as performance, in making their purchasing decisions.
As a result, a significant market has emerged for (1) protecting portable electronic devices, notably the “high end” tablet and smartphone devices, and (2) enhancing the consumer experience with accessories for mobile electronic devices.
We sell each of our product lines to consumers of electronic and hand-held devices directly via our websites and other key online e-tailers, and through our distributors and retail partners. We sell a significant amount of product for use on Apple’s iPad, iPhone, and iPod devices; Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones and tablets; and Microsoft’s Surface tablets, though we have experienced continued diversification as other manufacturers’ presence in the market has increased.
In addition to Apple and Samsung, the handheld electronics industry has continued to develop and market devices with touch screen interfaces, and several major manufacturers, including Microsoft, Motorola, Dell, Lenovo, Blackberry, Xiaomi, and HTC, continue to release innovative products each year. The InvisibleShield is the ideal device protection offering for all types of touch-screen devices, as it does not interfere with the functionality of the device while offering complete scratch-proof protection. Our keyboard product line is ideal for tablet and smartphone users as the product line includes keyboards that are both device specific and device agnostic, which are compatible with many tablet and smartphone devices. In addition, our IFROGZ Audio product lines offer excellent enhancement to any mobile device. Lastly, we view our mophie power cases and other portable power solutions as a potential market for significant future growth as mobile devices become more ingrained in our day-to-day lives. We intend to continue to focus our marketing and innovation efforts around these types of product solutions that protect and enhance mobile devices.
Market Segments
With thousands of InvisibleShield products/product configurations available, we have a protective covering for all major market segments of handheld electronic devices, including: smartphones, tablets, MP3 players, notebook computers, laptops, gaming devices, GPS devices, watch faces, and similar devices and surfaces. We intend to continue to configure the InvisibleShield product for use in newly developed consumer devices. The InvisibleShield can be quickly configured, packaged, and shipped to customers for new devices as they enter the consumer marketplace, making the InvisibleShield available for purchase at the time of or within days of the launch of new electronic devices. In addition, ISOD, a patent pending system used to cut an InvisibleShield for virtually any mobile device in seconds, makes it possible for retailers to have an InvisibleShield available on the launch date for all device releases.
One of the strongest market segments currently is the smartphone segment. Along with the tablet market, buyers are drawn to these devices by their elegant design, as well as their easy-to-use functionality. However, everyday use often mars the finish of the devices’ screens and other areas that receive wear and tear. InvisibleShield protection products and mophie and IFROGZ cases, offer excellent device protection, while not impeding the form or functionality of the smartphones and tablets and do not inhibit the touch sensitivity for smartphones and tablets with touch screen technology. Further, our keyboard line provides a professional and innovative solution to interact with tablets and smartphones. Lastly, the mophie ecosystem provides both power and protection accessories for virtually any mobile device.
As sales of electronics continue to grow, we anticipate that sales of our complementary accessory products will also continue to grow. The largest areas of our market opportunities relate to sales of smartphones and tablets. Management believes that ZAGG is positioned to serve 
4

market needs within this industry with our multiple product lines that include device protection, keyboards and keyboard cases, audio, power cases, mobile power, wireless charging, and protective cases.
Marketing and Distribution
Domestically, we sell our products on our websites, to big box electronics retailers, wireless retailers, distributors, and franchisees that own and operate kiosks and ZAGG branded stores in shopping malls and retail centers. In addition, our products are available for sale worldwide via our websites and through retailers and distributors we have partnered with from our subsidiaries in Ireland and China. Currently we advertise our products primarily on the Internet, through print advertisements in conjunction with our retail partners, and through point of sale displays at retail locations. We intend to continue to strategically expand our advertising activities in 2018, particularly through point of sales displays within retailers and social media campaigns on the Internet. We are also seeking to create strategic partnerships with makers of smartphones and tablets, electronic accessories, and mobile content providers to enhance our product offerings.
Indirect Channels (amounts in thousands)
We sell our products through indirect channels, including big box retailers, wireless retailers, domestic and international distributors, independent Apple retailers, university bookstores, and small independently owned consumer electronics stores. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold $463,366 of product, or approximately 89% of our overall net sales through this channel. We require indirect channel partners to enter into a reseller agreement with us.
We continue to sell directly to retailers or through distributors to market and place our products for sale in the United States and non-U.S. markets. We have entered into distribution agreements with partners throughout the world for the marketing, distribution and sale of our products.
Website Sales (amounts in thousands)
We sell our products worldwide directly to consumers on our websites at www.ZAGG.com and www.mophie.com. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold $39,661 of product, or approximately 8% of our overall net sales, through our websites. The URLs are included here as inactive textual references. Information contained on, or accessible through, our websites is not a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into this report.
Franchises (amounts in thousands)
We sell our products to franchisees that operate kiosks and ZAGG-branded stores in shopping malls and retail centers. We enter into agreements with third-party franchisees who then purchase our products and resell them to consumers. As part of the standard franchise agreement, franchisees are charged an up-front fee that is recognized into revenue over the life of the franchise term. In addition, ZAGG operates a corporate ZAGG-branded store. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold $16,468 of product, or approximately 3% of our overall net sales, through franchisees and our corporate owned store.
Warranties
We offer a limited lifetime warranty of the durability of our InvisibleShield products. If the InvisibleShield is ever scratched or damaged in the course of normal use, a customer may return the old product and we will replace it at no cost to the customer other than a minimal handling fee. The products to which the InvisibleShield is applied typically have relatively short lives, which helps to limit our exposure for warranty claims. Should products cease to function properly, we also offer manufacturer's warranties for our products. For ZAGG and iFrogz-branded products, we offer a one-year manufacturer's warranty and for mophie-branded products, we offer a two-year manufacturer's warranty.
Suppliers
We do not directly manufacture any of our products, rather we employ various third-party manufacturing partners in the United States and Asia to perform these services on our behalf. The services employed by these third parties include the selection of sub-suppliers that provide raw materials and other components used in the manufacturing process. We have endeavored to use common components and readily available raw materials in the design of our products that can be sourced from multiple sub-suppliers. However, raw film used in our InvisibleShield film and ISOD products has been produced by a single supplier for the last nine years. Our film supplier has contractually agreed to not sell the raw materials to any of our competitors.
Below is a high-level summary by product category of the manufacturing sources used by the Company:

• | Screen Protection – Our screen protection product line is comprised of InvisibleShield glass products (approximately 85% of 2017 screen protection sales or 40% of net sales), InvisibleShield film products (approximately 13% of 2017 screen protection sales or 6% of net sales), and ISOD film blanks (approximately 2% of 2017 screen protection sales or 1% of net sales). Our InvisibleShield glass products are sourced from factories in Asia with protective glass expertise, each of which uses a number of

5

sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components. Our InvisibleShield film and ISOD products are sourced through our third-party logistics partner, who purchases the raw film inventory from a single supplier (as discussed above).

• | Battery Cases and Power Management – Our battery case and power management product lines consist of power products that are designed to provide on-the-go power for tablets, smartphones, MP3 players, cameras, and virtually all other electronic mobile devices. Our power products are sourced from factories in Asia with battery expertise, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components.


• | Keyboards – Our keyboard product line consists of (1) device specific keyboards designed to fit individual tablets produced by original equipment manufacturers and (2) keyboards that are designed to be device agnostic and can be used on virtually any mobile device. Our keyboard products are sourced from factories in Asia with keyboard expertise, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components.


• | Audio – Our audio product line consists of earbuds and headphones that are designed to be compatible with virtually all electronic mobile devices. Our audio products are sourced from factories in Asia with audio expertise, each of which uses a number of sub-suppliers for raw materials and other components.

Our product and operations teams work closely with suppliers from initial product development and throughout the manufacturing process to ensure that (1) the supplier understands and will build according to product specifications, (2) appropriate quality is maintained for the finished goods and for all sub-components, and (3) the supplier can meet our supply needs.
Intellectual Property Rights
We own utility and design patents in the U.S. and in various foreign countries which correspond to a number of our products, including patents with claims focused on certain features of ZAGG’s InvisibleShield screen protection for electronic devices. ZAGG continues to actively pursue further protection for its InvisibleShield screen protection and associated methods in the United States and in foreign countries, having filed patent applications for (i) both wet and dry application processes for securing protective films to consumer electronic devices; (ii) dry-application protective films; and (iii) on-demand production of electronic device accessories, including films. In addition, ZAGG has filed applications, and in some instances secured patents, for a variety of its battery cases, mobile power, wireless charging, keyboard, and protective case products. ZAGG has additional patents pending in the U.S. and internationally for a variety of current and expected products.
ZAGG owns thousands of InvisibleShield protective film designs for protecting a variety of consumer electronic devices. New designs are routinely added to ZAGG’s portfolio to accommodate the newest electronic devices on the market. Additionally, ZAGG is the owner of numerous trademarks for use in connection with its goods and services. ZAGG has filed formal applications for a variety of trademarks, and has further secured trademark registrations for many of its trademarks in both the U.S. and in foreign countries.
ZAGG has strategically developed relationships and exclusive agreements with a number of third party vendors and suppliers. ZAGG’s long-standing relationship with its raw material suppliers and its manufacturers expands the scope of potential intellectual property (“IP”) protection available to ZAGG, including development of innovative solutions for protective films. These relationships also provide ZAGG with a reasonable expectation that it will be able to supply customers with products long into the future.
Our film supplier retains the patents and IP rights for products it develops on our behalf, though has contractually agreed to not sell the raw materials to any of our competitors. The IP protection held by the Company varies in effectiveness in preventing certain aspects of competition. Although the Company believes the protection of IP is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company views the following as our keys to past and future success: (1) our distribution relationships with customers, (2) the speed we can bring a product to market, and (3) our ability to effectively launch a product into market to generate maximum sales. Additionally, we believe ZAGG’s success is also based upon creative product solutions, establishing the preferred brand among both retailers and consumers, and targeted global distribution.
Protection of IP is important to the Company and we protect IP when appropriate, however, we do not view IP in our industry as the key barrier to entry because of the rapidly changing industry that we operate in. Very often, by the time we receive patent or other IP protection on a product that would serve as a barrier to entry, the market has moved on to new technologies or products. Given this, we are very selective in what we decide to protect, measuring the cost to protect certain aspects of IP against the potential benefit.
Due to our close partnership with suppliers in Asia, our third-party logistics partner, and the manufacturer of the raw film used in our InvisibleShield and ISOD products, our product development teams work directly with these partners in the development of products. Our key suppliers in Asia have contractually agreed that the Company will retain all patents and IP rights to products that arise through our relationship, including design changes and innovations regardless of who instigates the product development change.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 543 full-time and part-time employees, including our management team. 457 of our employees are located in the United States and support our domestic operations, while 86 employees are located in international locations to support our international operations. No employee is represented by a labor union, and we have never suffered an interruption of business caused by labor disputes. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.

Our Corporate History
ZAGG and its subsidiaries are innovation leaders in mobile tech accessories for smartphones and tablets. For over 10 years, ZAGG has developed creative product solutions that enhance and protect mobile devices for consumers around the world. The Company has an award-winning product portfolio that includes screen protection, power cases, power management, wireless charging, personal audio, mobile keyboards, cases, and social tech sold under the ZAGG, InvisibleShield, mophie, and IFROGZ brands.
In June 2011, ZAGG acquired IFROGZ, an audio and protective case company, which expanded the ZAGG product lines beyond screen protection and keyboards.
In March 2016, ZAGG acquired mophie, a leader in the power management and power case categories. This acquisition further diversified the ZAGG product lines into key growth product categories. The results of operations of mophie are included in the Company's results of operations beginning on March 3, 2016.
Seasonal Business
The Company has historically been positively impacted near the time of major device launches by Apple and Samsung, particularly when there is a change in form factor. We expect major device launches to continue to positively impact our operations during 2018 and beyond.
