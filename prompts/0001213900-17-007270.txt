Company History
 
Helix TCS, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on March 13, 2014. Pursuant to the acquisition of the assets of Helix TCS, LLC, as discussed below, we changed our name from Jubilee4 Gold, Inc. to Helix TCS, Inc. effective October 25, 2015.
 
Effective October 25, 2015 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into an acquisition and exchange agreement (the “Agreement”) with Helix TCS LLC (the “LLC”). We closed the transaction contemplated under the Agreement (the “Acquisition”) on December 23, 2015 and Helix TCS, LLC was merged into and with Helix.
 
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the owner of 100% of the issued and outstanding units of the LLC immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition, exchanged their units for an aggregate of 22,225,000 shares of our common stock (post-reverse split) and all of our issued Class A Preferred Stock.
 
Effective April 11, 2016, we acquired the assets of Revolutionary Software, LLC (“Revolutionary”). The acquisition occurred through two transactions, the first occurred on March 14, 2016 and the second occurred on April 11, 2016. The total consideration for acquisition included payment in the form of $650,000 in cash and 2,395,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company. A portion of the cash consideration was paid at each transaction closing and a portion is being paid over time.
 
Overview 
 
It is our mission to be a leading comprehensive security and operating environment solutions provider, catering to businesses in the legalized cannabis industry. As a security industry expert based in Denver, Colorado, we plan to expand our operations to serve additional legalized U.S. states as cannabis sale regulations are implemented.
Commercial Services
 
Security is a primary concern for licensed cannabis businesses and the state regulators who oversee such programs. Facilities with cannabis permits must adopt strong security systems to protect their businesses and comply with regulations. These businesses maintain valuable inventories onsite and typically also have significant cash holdings since transactions are often conducted in cash. Such facilities are exposed to theft both from outsiders and employees. In addition, business operators in most legal cannabis states must show regulatory agencies that security systems carefully protect and track inventories and transactions. Failure to do so could not only result in large losses, but would also threaten businesses’ operating permits and force closure. In Washington and Colorado, the new adult cannabis use laws introduced and stressed the need for on premise security to control and enforce the age restrictions and act as a deterrent to the general public, who are now able to freely enter cannabis shops.
 
We provide effective security solutions to cannabis businesses, including assessments and planning, security system design and implementation, asset protection, transport, and assurance of security for the state licensing process. All systems and services are guaranteed to meet individual state regulatory requirements and to achieve compliance.

Cannabase
 
Cannabase is an online community for registered legal cannabis license holders. As of December 31, 2016, a majority of the users are in the state of Colorado. After the acquisition of the Cannabase technology from Revolutionary Software, LLC in April 2016, we launched Cannabase Reach, which helps ancillary (non-licensed) cannabis businesses drive sales through advertising to the licensee community on Cannabase. Cannabase Reach advertising packages consist of virtual catalogues where vendors can display their products and services, promote deals, post business updates, post live surveys, and be reviewed by clients in the market. Packages also include ad points that allow vendors to put display ads up in the marketplace, driving traffic to their storefront, deals, or external website.
Industry and Regulatory Background
 
In the 1930’s, Congress made marijuana illegal on the federal level, and it was scheduled as a narcotic. In the 1960s and 1970s, as the popularity of marijuana use grew, states began to realize that they needed drug policies consistent with the community and consumer use of marijuana. Under the Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, marijuana is currently classified as a “Schedule I” controlled substance. The level of enforcement in states varies widely regarding marijuana.
 
In 1996, Oregon and California passed legislation that legalized the possession and consumption of marijuana use for medical purposes. As of December 31, 2016, twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana in one form or another. The Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska state policies to legalize recreational marijuana were not challenged by federal authorities, which was largely due to the guidance put forth in the August 29, 2013 memorandum from James Cole, the U.S. Deputy Attorney General, titled “Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement” (the “Cole Memo”). This memorandum states that federal enforcement agencies are unlikely to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in states where marijuana has been legalized, and where the regulation and control is functional. Following the election in November 2016, eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational cannabis use.
 
On the federal level, marijuana has been considered an illegal substance since 1930. This has caused various impediments to the marijuana industry, the most prominent of which is in banking. Although the U.S. Treasury has provided guidance intended to give banks the confidence that they can work with marijuana businesses in legal cannabis states, many banks are still reluctant to do so.
 
Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is categorized as a “Schedule I” controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the United States Department of Justice. It is currently illegal to grow, possess, sell, purchase, and/or consume cannabis under Federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medicinal use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice also characterizes Schedule I controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological and/or physical dependence.
 
Despite this, twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have passed state laws that permit doctors to prescribe cannabis for medicinal use. Additionally, eight states, and the District of Columbia, have enacted laws that allow recreational adult use of cannabis. As a result of the foregoing, an unpredictable business environment has been created for cannabis companies that can legally operate under state laws but are nonetheless openly in violation of Federal laws. On August 29, 2013, United States Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued the Cole Memo to United States Attorneys guiding them to prioritize enforcement of Federal law away from the cannabis industry operating as permitted under state law, so long as:
 

● | cannabis is not being distributed to minors and dispensaries are not located around schools and public buildings; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the proceeds from sales are not going to gangs, cartels or criminal enterprises; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cannabis grown in states where it is legal is not being diverted to other states; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cannabis-related businesses are not being used as a cover for sales of other illegal drugs or illegal activity; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there is not any violence or use of fire-arms in the cultivation and sale of marijuana; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there is strict enforcement of drugged-driving laws and adequate prevention of adverse health consequences; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cannabis is not grown, used, or possessed on Federal properties. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cole Memo is intended only as a guide for United States Attorneys and does not alter in any way the Department of Justice’s Federal authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal law relating to cannabis, regardless of state law. We believe, and have implemented procedures and policies to ensure, that we are operating in compliance with the Cole Memo. However, we cannot provide assurance that our actions are in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other laws or regulations.
 
While initially it was difficult for us to access the banking system it has become easier with less stringent interpretations of the Cole Memo. Our banks have requested information from us through questionnaires based on the Cole Memo and we believe that the banks have realized that our participation in the marijuana industry is limited by the amounts of marijuana that our employees are exposed to and the vendors that we pay.
 
The Obama administration effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, the Trump administration has made statements implying that it could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws more stringently, but no specific measures have yet been implemented. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the Federal or state governments.
 
The Market
 
The market has two categories of participants: consumers (i.e. users, retail buyers, individuals) and businesses (i.e. operators, cultivators, retailers, processors, etc.). Consumers are those that are permitted to use marijuana for medicinal purposes and have received medical advice from physicians for conditions that qualify for treatment with cannabis under state-specific guidelines. In eight states and the District of Columbia, anyone who is 21 years or older can consume cannabis products for medical purposes as described above, or for recreational purposes. 
 
Businesses include companies that handle marijuana directly, including cultivators, processors, dispensaries and retail distributors. Also, included in businesses are companies that do not directly handle the marijuana plant or products, but benefit from the industry as participating ancillary businesses (i.e. equipment manufacturers, insurance companies, lenders, etc.).
 
Legal cannabis businesses that produce and distribute cannabis products serve patient and adult consumer populations in states that have passed and enforce cannabis laws. As more states adopt marijuana regulations to legalize cannabis, the number of businesses in the industry may accelerate rapidly.
 
Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
For 2017, we are targeting customers in up to eight states and Washington D.C., which we believe are the most active legal cannabis territories in the national market. While market data sources are limited for the industry, we estimate that there may be over 6,600 permitted cannabis facilities within our targeted territories in 2016-2017.
 
Growth within these states, in addition to new states coming online and the expansion of cannabis programs in mature state markets, will increase the addressable market. These expanded state regulatory approvals that permit larger patient bases for medicinal and recreational cannabis use further imply and emphasize the potential for substantial expansion beyond the near-term opportunities.
 
Many states are emulating Colorado’s regulatory model, which requires tight business security, compliance, and adherence to regulations enforced by state and industry oversight agencies. Helix’s experience with compliance in multiple states and municipalities provides a significant competitive advantage for serving businesses in new markets, especially those that are adopting rules similar to the Colorado cannabis laws.

The cannabis industry is expanding, not only in terms of the number of states with cannabis laws, but also in the scope of business transactions allowed under state regulations. Colorado and Washington, for example, have approved the legal sale of marijuana for both recreational and medicinal use. This has increased cannabis sales, revenue, and taxes in those states, when compared to the market size of medicinal cannabis alone. The successful results of these state cannabis programs provide viable incentives for other states to legalize cannabis for recreational use, a few of which legalized recreational cannabis use in the November 2016 election.
 
Helix expanded operations through acquisition of new customers in the growing cannabis market both by entering new states and capitalizing on the growth of its large customer base in Colorado. In addition, Helix will continue to achieve market penetration in key states by working with state regulatory agencies to influence security compliance, adding key personnel, word of mouth, client expansion into new markets and targeted marketing campaigns in Arizona, Alaska, Oregon and California which characterize the lion’s share of new opportunities outside of Colorado and Washington.
 
Asset Acquisition
 
During March and April 2016, we acquired the assets of Revolutionary. Revolutionary was the founder and operator of Cannabase which aspired to be a wholesale marketplace for the legal cannabis industry. The assets acquired were development stage software, web addresses, and certain trademarks. We have transformed certain intangible assets into business lines that were not explored by Revolutionary prior to the transaction. Revolutionary’s revenue was generated primarily from wholesale brokerage commissions from transactions that were facilitated by the Cannabase platform.
 
Cannabase was a tradename used for an attempt to build an online community. There was virtually no revenue created from the prior to our acquisition of Revolutionary assets. The Company has and will continue to spend significant capital to attempt to develop this online community. The Company intends to do this by writing new software code, hiring salespeople, and opening into other states. Revolutionary was not scalable on a multi-regional basis due to it being limited to the legal cannabis industry which is operational in certain states. The revenues generated since the asset acquisition have been generated from an advertising business model that was not in effect at Revolutionary. Since only nominal revenues had been generated previous to the acquisition, and the Company has had to, and will continue to, invest substantial capital to transform the software assets acquired for use in a new business model.
 
We are currently in the process of developing advertising, consumer-focused, and data-related business lines using the intellectual property acquired. To achieve the new business plan, we expect it will continue to take significant management time, as well as substantial financial resources in software development, marketing, sales personnel, and technology expenditures.
 
Competition
 
We have positioned ourselves as an innovative security firm with a recognizable brand that offers effective and consistent services. Our competition in the security services sector of the cannabis industry includes: Blue Line Protection Group, Security Grade Protective Services, Safe Systems, Inc., Canna Security America, Iron Protection Group, and a variety of smaller, local security companies. Certain of these security providers are larger than we are and have greater financial resources than we do. We believe that we can continue to compete with these companies based on our favorable reputation for outstanding reliability, customer service, and value added. There is no assurance, however, that our ability to deliver services successfully will not be impacted by competition that currently exists or may arise in the future.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 57 full time employees and 23 part time employees. We believe that the employer-employee relationships in our Company are positive. We have no labor union contracts.
