ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
 
The Structure of our Business
 

China YCT International Group ("CYIG" or "the Company") is engaged in developing, manufacturing and selling traditional Chinese medicines made primarily from ginseng extract processing and selling acer truncatum bunge seed oils, and distributing health care supplement products manufactured by another company in the PRC. The Company also operates through its  97% owned subsidiary, Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ("Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical"), a corporation organized in the People's Republic of China and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Landway Nano Bio-Tech Group, Inc. ("Landway Nano"), incorporated in Delaware. Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical was originally organized as a subsidiary of Shandong Yong Chun Tang Bioengineering Co., Ltd. ("Shandong Yongchuntang ") for the purpose of focusing on advanced technology related to the use of gingko as an aide to health. Shandong Yongchuntang later transferred ownership of Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical to its equity-holders, who transferred their ownership to the Company in 2007.
 
While we now develop, manufacture and sell our own products, Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical initially served solely as a distributor for Shandong Yongchuntang pursuant to a distribution agreement initially signed in 2006 that fixed the resale profit that would be earned by Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical from products purchased from Shandong Yongchuntang. In January 2007, Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical commenced distributing products manufactured by Shandong Yongchuntang. On February 20, 2017, we renewed the agreement for a term of one year ending on February 25, 2018. Pursuant to the renewed contract, we can purchase nine products from Shandong Yongchuntang at fixed prices.  Mr. Yan Tinghe, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, was the principal shareholder of Shandong Yongchuntang until he sold all of his shares of Shandong Yongchuntang to an unrelated party on December 16, 2009. 
  Shandong Yongchuntang Pharmaceutical owns 3% equity of Shandong Spring starting from March 18, 2017.

The Development of Acer Truncatum Bunge Planting Base
 
On March 22, 2011, the Chinese Ministry of Health officially approved acer truncatum bunge seed oil, along with peony seed oil as a new food resource (No. 9 Announcement issued in 2011). Subsequently, in December 2011, the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission, jointly with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, issued the Twelfth Five-year Development Plan of Food Industry, whereby "the nutrition and health food manufacturing industry" was listed for the first time in the national development plan as a focused developing area. In July 2013, the Company initiated an investment plan (the "Plan") to take advantage of the national policy.

Accordingly, the Company began to develop and cultivate its own planting base for acer truncatum bunge in June 2013. As of March 31, 2017, the Company signed four separate lease agreements for the leasing of 6,080 Mu of farmland for a term of 30 years and 14 years, respectively, and has completed planting of 7,424,000 trees. The development of the project will have taken five years with a total investment of approximately RMB302 million (approximately $49.3 million).  As of March 31, 2017, we have invested approximately $42 million in the development of acer truncatum bunge planting base.  These trees are expected to be in production in the fall of the calendar year 2018 along with the construction of an ecological, scientific, and industrial park and related supporting facilities from 2015 to 2018. Until our own planting base begins production, we will continue to purchase from third parties the acer truncatum bunge pods used to produce the seed oils.
 
On March 18, 2017, we entered into an Acquisition Agreement on Acer Truncatum Industrial Project (the "Agreement") with Shandong Yongchuntang.  Pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed to transfer 3% equity of Shandong Spring in exchange for tangible and intangible assets related to the Acer Truncatum Industrial Project (the "Project"), which was owned by Shandong Yongchuntang. The Project includes research equipment, a patent on the refinery process of the Acer Truncatum's seed oils, a trademark with the name of "Bao Feng San Yi", and some relevant certifications issued to Shandong Yongchuntang. As result of this acquisition, Shandong Yongchuntang became a 3% shareholder of Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical, and the Company agreed to add a person designated by Shandong Yongchuntang to its Board of Directors. The profits from our health, medical, and acer truncatum bunge oil products are adequate to fund our ongoing operations. In order to fully implement its business plan, however, Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical will require a capital infusion to mainly finance the increasing production of seed oil from acer truncatum bunge. The estimated funding requirement is about $5 million.


The Market for Major Products
 
The Company's own product, Huoliyuan Capsule, is the only herbal medicine of its type made in the form of a capsule among all peer products.  Most peer products come in the form of tablets. After the 2014 crisis in China regarding the quality failure in capsule materials, the market demand for Huoliyuan capsule has been stabilized. In addition, since 2015, the Chinese FDA issued more restrictive policies over the sales of medicines by eliminating middle layers of distributors between the medicine manufacturers and the end users  This policy, at a certain level, affects our sales of the Huoliyuan Capsule.  Prior to the issuance of this policy, our distributors could sell the medicine to both the end users who were developed by the distributors themselves and developed by their subcontractors.  After the issuance of this policy, our distributors more likely lost the sales to the end users who were developed by their subcontractors because these subcontractors were eliminated by the policy and no longer in the sales channel.   


Our Ginkgo Herbal Tea is health food approved by Ministry of Health (WeiShiJianZi 1999 No. 0529). We have established our unique distribution system with hundreds of franchised stores. While sales of other ginkgo products are sluggish due to their single formulas and plain manner of distribution, some competitors lost their market share after a few years. The Company expects that there will be a growth market for the health herbal teas from the growing senior population in China while the market is becoming more competitive.
 
Traditional Chinese medicine recommends consumption of gingko tea to improve circulation and pulmonary function. Although scientific testing of the health benefits traditionally attributed to gingko has been inconclusive to date, there remains a widespread belief in the benefits of a regimen of gingko consumption. In particular, the potential use of gingko to alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease has attracted attention. Various research articles, including an article published by the Shandong Traditional Chinese Medical University in 2010, has reported research results on the use of gingko to alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. The flavonoid aglycone, a compound derived from the gingko plant, is widely used in pharmaceutical formulations as well as in food and cosmetic products. The flavonoid aglycone is listed as a dual food/drug product by the Ministry of Health of China. Our cosmetic flavonoid aglycone product, YCT Ginkgo Freckle Cream has received Cosmetic Product Certificate issued by the Ministry of Health of China.


Since July 2015, we have produced acer truncatum bunge seed oils and sold the products to customers through our distributors. The Acer truncatum bunge seed oil is extracted from the acer truncatum pods that are purchased from third party vendors. Our self-grown acer truncatum pods will not be ready to be used for production until approximately the fall of 2018. During the year ended March 31, 2017, our sales of Acer truncatum Bunge Seed Oil has increased by 155.1% compared with the prior year.

Patents and Technology

In March 2010, the Company purchased a patent from Shandong Yongchuntang for US$6.74 million, which enabled the Company to manufacture and distribute medicine products for cardio cerebral vascular disease, cosmetics, and healthcare products. The patent acquired from Shandong Yongchuntang was independently assessed at a fair value of USD11.14 million by Beijing Beifang Yashi Asset Evaluation Company based on the current income value method. The purchase price for the patent was negotiated between the Company and Shandong Yongchuntang based on the assessed value and was purchased by the Company at a discount. The patent is for an aglycone type and purification method of biotransformation in herbal product manufacturing process to extracting herbal flavonoid more extensively, and it has a legal life of 16.5 years.

On October 26, 2010, Shandong Spring Pharmaceutical signed an agreement to purchase three patents relating to Chinese herbal formulas from Jining Tianruitong Technology Development Limited Company for $15,557,318. We received an independent assessment of the value of the patents, which substantiated the purchase price. Approval from the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC is required for the transfer of the patent. We obtained governmental approvals for the transfer of the two patents in October 2011, which were transferred to the Company. Due to the failure of obtaining governmental approval for the third patent, the Company amended the agreement in January 2013 to reflect the two acquired patents with a final cost of $11,459,260. The acquisition of the third patent was cancelled with the outstanding payment settled. The two patents are "Treatment to ischemic encephalopathy and its preparation method" (ZL200510045001.9) and "Chinese herbal medicine compound to treat renal insufficiency and its preparation" (ZL200710013301.8), with legal lives of approximately 14 years and 15 years, respectively.  One patent was fully impaired in the year ended March 31, 2016.
 
Research and Development: Our Products
 
Our goal is to utilize advanced biological technology to isolate and extract the beneficial compounds in plants that have traditionally been known to have medicinal benefits. We also focus our research on the seed selection and planting technologies for greater yield of leaves and seeds from the plants as well as the most efficient method to isolate and extract nervonic acid from seed oil. We have a staff of 29 employees engaged in research and development of new technologies and resulting products. In addition we maintain close ties to the research staffs at Tsinghua University, China Agriculture University, Shandong Herbal Medicine University, and the Shandong Herbal Medicine Research Institute. We entered into a written R&D Cooperation Agreement with Nanjing Forestry University, pursuant to which we will invest in a national herbal R&D center with Nanjing Forestry University and have the right of first refusal on the transfer and use of Nanjing Forestry University's herbal related technologies. We also entered into an R&D Cooperation Agreement with Shandong University on April 26, 2011, which was effective until April 25, 2014. Pursuant to the agreement with Shandong University, we invested RMB 300,000 (approximately USD 45,000) in R&D projects and will be the co-owner of the resulting technologies. We were also committed to making further investments equal to 10% of our profits arising from Shandong University's technologies.  Currently, we maintain an informal cooperative relationship with Shandong University.
  
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we spent $809,485 in research and development. Our R&D expenses were primarily used for acquiring and testing raw material, and also the ordinary maintenance expense for our research equipment.  In March 2017, we acquired research equipment that will be used for developing an enhanced manufacturing process for our acer truncatum bunge seed oil.
 
Huoliyuan Capsule
 
In January 2007, the Company purchased from Beijing Boya Research Institution, Ltd., a patent for RMB400,000 (approximately USD$58,000) for the Huoliyuan Capsule. In 2010, the Company started to manufacture and distribute our new product, Huoliyuan Capsule. During the year ended March 31, 2017, the Company produced approximately 5.63 million boxes of (1*3 pack) and 2.98 million boxes of (1*2 pack) of Huoliyuan Capsule.  
 
Huoliyuan Capsule is approved by the State Food and Drug Administration (the "SFDA") of China. The Huoliyuan capsule is manufactured according to the traditional Chinese medicine concepts. The main ingredients of Huoliyuan are: Panax Ginseng Leaves Extract, Radix Astragali, Radix Ophiopogonis, Schisandra Chinensis and Monkshood; all are traditional Chinese herbal medicines. Huoliyuan capsule is formulated for slow release and used for daily use. The therapeutic effect of Huoliyuan was tested by independent analysts, the Jining Institute for Drug Control in 2003. The test primarily consists of a Character Test, Identification Test, Water Index, Load Difference, Disintegration Time and Microbial Limit. The test concluded that Huoliyuan was beneficial for the human cardiovascular system and as an aid in the treatment of chronic hepatitis, diabetes, insomnia, memory loss, menopause syndrome, and other maladies.

Marketing
 
We distribute products of Shandong Yongchuntang pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Contract executed on December 26, 2006. The contract set forth the wholesale prices at which we purchase products from Shandong Yongchuntang. On February 20, 2017, we renewed the contract with Shandong Yongchuntang for a term of one year ending on February 25, 2018. Pursuant to the renewed one year contract, for the period from February 26, 2017 to February 25, 2018, we can purchase nine products from Shandong Yongchuntang on fixed prices.
 
Our in-house marketing staff supervises independent primary dealers, who sub-distribute through networks of supermarkets, beauty parlors and other retail sites. This network allows us to accomplish broad geographic distribution with a marketing staff of only eight people, thus keeping our overhead low. On January 7, 2009, we have established a strategic relationship with China National Post Logistics, a subsidiary of China Post that has 31 provincial offices located throughout China to deliver our products to our customers. In the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company mainly sold products to individual retail customers through ten major distributors. Since May 2015, we have been permitted by Shandong Yongchuntang to use the direct-sale license issued to Shandong Yongchuntang for sales of Shandong Yongchuntang's health care products.  We were able to build up a larger customer basis through the direct-sales' channels and boost the sales of health care products.
