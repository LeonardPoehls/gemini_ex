The Company believes the reproducibility of scientific studies has become a substantial issue in life science research from drug discovery and development through clinical trials as researchers throughout the world continue to use different protocols for processes associated with sample preparation, cryopreservation and cold chain management. We believe the scientific community is becoming more aware of factors that affect sample integrity and experimental variability. By standardizing handling, storage, and transportation protocols we can substantially improve the quality and reproducibility of preclinical and clinical data which will help to accelerate the transition from lab research to drug and therapy development and market launch. To this end, we have licensed affiliates operating on our cellular collection-processing and storage platform in Tokyo, Japan, and Hong Kong. Our licensees purchase our CELLECT adipose tissue collection kits and ACSelerate CP storage consumables from us.
 
Our business strategy is centered on marketing our standardized platform as a complete adipose stem cell (Adult Stem Cells) solution and expanding our research and development through scientific collaborations. We are generating initial revenues through the sale and licensing of our patented products, laboratory tools, and services to capitalize on: (1) ADSC technologies; (2) scientific breakthroughs incorporating ADSCs that have been developing in the fast growing Regenerative and Personalized Medicine industries; (3) providing these growth industries with a standardized ADSC cell processing platform; (4) enhancing the delivery of healthcare through cellular-based therapies and applications which address disease treatment, wound and burn healing, joint repair and personalized health and beauty care; and (5) building a global network of physicians and affiliated laboratory facilities for the delivery of our products and services.
 
Our proprietary, patent pending clinical processing platform allows for the collection, preparation and cryo-preservation of adipose tissue without manipulation, bio-generation or the addition of animal-derived products or other chemical materials which require removal from the tissue sample upon retrieval or prior to use. Management believes this core process makes each tissue sample suitable for use in cosmetic grafting procedures or for further processing to adult stem cells for other types of stem cell therapies. Currently, we believe there are numerous therapeutic and orthopedic applications for adipose tissue and adult stem cell treatments identified or in use globally. As of January 1, 2016, a review of clinicaltrials.gov, operated by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) indicates that there is a significant number of clinical trials registered or completed that are focused on adipose tissue (2083), adult stem cells (5709), adipose derived stem cells (205), mesenchymal stem cells (682), and stromal vascular fraction (69).

Products and Services
 
American CryoStem is focused on multiple high margin business lines capable of generating sustainable, recurring revenue streams from each of our developed products and services. The Company also incorporates its proprietary and patented or patent pending laboratory products, such as our ACSelerate™ cell culture media, into our processing product production and contract manufacturing services. Additionally, the Company requires licensee’s of our tissue and cell processing technologies to purchase all the consumable products required in the collection, processing and storage of tissue/stem cells as part of the licensing agreement including our CELLECT® Validated Collection, Transportation, and Storage System and ACSelerate™ Cell Culture Media Products.
 
To date, we have generated minimal revenue; however, subject to, among other factors, obtaining the requisite financing, management believes that we are well positioned to utilize our developed products and services as the foundation for international distribution through licensees of our technologies and a host of Regenerative Medicine uses and future applications. In the US we operate an FDA registered facility that generates revenue from; the processing and storage of adipose tissue (ATGRAFT), the processing of adipose tissue into its cellular components for future use (ATCELL) and the production and sale of our CELLECT® tissue collection boxes, and patented media products.
 
The products and services are also designed to become an integral part of generating revenue from current and planned licensing territories, our New Jersey based collection, processing and storage operations (CELLECT®) sale and licensing of our developed laboratory products (ACSelerate™  and ATCELL™) , and cellular therapy development activities.
 
CELLECT® Validated Collection, Transportation, and Storage System – An unbreakable “chain of custody” clinical solution for physicians to collect and deliver tissue samples utilizing proprietary and patent pending methods and materials. The CELLECT® service is monitored in real-time and assures the highest cell viability upon laboratory receipt. The CELLECT® system incorporates our ACSelerate–TR™ transport medium into all collection bags which supports the health of the tissue during transport. The CELLECT® kit is an integral part of our validated ATGRAFT™ and ATCELL™ technology to be used by all licensees of our technologies. The CELLECT® service is included in our patent application U.S. Serial No. 13/702,304.
 
American CryoStem is the first tissue bank to globally incorporate through its CELLECT® service the International Blood Banking identification and labeling and product identification coding system. The coding was developed in conjunction with the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), the American Red Cross and the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). These groups form the International Council for Commonality in Blood Banking Automation (ICCBBA) and developed the ISBT 128 Standard for machine readable labeling. This labeling system is an acceptable machine readable labeling standard, product description, and bar coding system for FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research under 21 CFR 606.12(c) 13. American CryoStem conforms to this standard in its laboratory facility and all cellular and tissue products produced at the facility carry our W3750 ICCBBA facility identifier allowing any hospital, clinic, laboratory and regulator worldwide to identify the origin and obtain additional information on any sample produced at an American CryoStem facility. The Company will promote this standard in all laboratories that license or utilize our technology.
 
ATGRAFT™ Adipose Tissue Storage Service – A clinical fat storage solution allowing physicians to provide their patients with multiple tissue and cell storage options. The ATGRAFT™ service, through one liposuction procedure allows individuals to prepare for future cosmetic or regenerative procedures by using their own stored adipose tissue as a natural biocompatible filler or the components for cellular therapy application without the trauma of further liposuctions. ATGRAFT™ procedures may include breast reconstruction, layered augmentation, buttocks enhancement or volume corrections of the hands, feet, face and neck areas that experience significant adipose tissue (fat) volume reduction as we age. ATGRAFT™ is processed and stored utilizing our standards so that any stored fat tissue sample may be retrieved in the future and re-processed to create stem cells ATCELL™, our clinical grade cell product for use in Regenerative Medicine applications. The ATGRAFT™ service is included in our pending patent application U.S. Serial No. 13/646,647.
 
The Company’s charges standardized fees for ATGRAFT™ tissue processing and minimum annual storage fees depending on the volume of tissue processed. These processing and storage fees may be paid by the collecting/treating physician or the consumer. The Company earns additional fees upon sample retrieval, for the thawing, packaging and shipment of the stored samples to the physician or clinic for immediate use upon receipt. Additionally, physicians may request that any stored ATGRAFT™ tissue sample of 25ml or greater be reprocessed utilizing the Company’s ATCELL™ and Autokine-CM™ processing. The Company charges fees for the reprocessing of a 25ml stored ATGRAFT™ sample and may charge additional fee’s if expansion of the newly created ATCELL™ sample is also requested.

The Company believes the ATGRAFT™ service may create patient retention, and significant revenue opportunities for the participating physician. The ATGRAFT™ service lowers physician overall costs by eliminating additional liposuction procedures for each scheduled fat transfer or therapy procedure. Physician cost savings may include: materials, supplies, equipment, and the expenses of utilizing a surgical center, hospital operating room or an in-office aseptic procedure room. The ATGRAFT™ service is designed to operate under the minimally manipulated regulations contained in both 21 CFR 1271.10 and PHS 361.
 
ATCELL™ Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) – Clinically processed and characterized adipose derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) created using the Company’s proprietary Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and ACSelerate™ patented cell culture media. ATCELL™ is the Company’s trademarked name for its ADRCs and differentiated cell products and processing methodology. The Company maintains multiple master and differentiated cell lines and labels them according to their characterization. (i.e. ATCELL™ (adipose derived stem cells) ATCELL-SVF™ (stromal vascular fraction), ATCELL – CH™ (differentiated chondrocytes) , etc. Cell lines are custom created for patients desiring to store their cells for their own use in future Regenerative Medicine procedures. The Company charges its customers fees to process previously stored ATGRAFT™ sample and for newly collected client tissue samples to be processed. Customer samples submitted for processing must utilize the CELLECT® collection system and ACSelerate™ mediums to conform to our internal SOPs and quality control standards.
 
The Company believes it will earn additional fees based upon the proposed storage configuration of the final ATCELL™ sample and future culturing in the ACSelerate™ cell culture and differentiation media. Cell culturing and differentiation may be performed upon receipt of the raw tissue sample or at any time on a previously processed and cryopreserved ATGRAFT™ or ATCELL™ sample. ATCELL™ has shown that it is ideally suited for expansion and differentiation into additional cell types utilizing the ACSelerate™ line of culture and differentiation mediums. The ATCELL™ products and services are incorporated into our pending patent filing US Serial No. 13/646,647.
 
The Company’s ATCELL™ cell lines are processed and cultured in our patented ACSelerate™ cell culture media. All tissue, cells, and research materials made available for sale to research institutions are tested for sterility, disease, lifespan, and population doubling rate (PDL). Additionally, we believe these cells are suited for any type of cellular therapy or regenerative medicine research. Cell morphology is confirmed by (i) flow cytometry and (ii) differentiation analysis using ACSelerate™ differentiation media. Each ATCELL™ line can be further cultured and differentiated allowing the Company to provide genetically matched clinical grade cell types. We believe this research methodology may provide opportunities for the Company’s ATCELL™ and ACSelerate™ products to become the building blocks of final developed commercial applications.
 
The Company intends to support its cell therapy application research, development and collaborative efforts by making ATCELL™ and ATGRAFT™ samples available for research and product development purposes through joint ventures, and university and commercial collaborations. These adipose tissue and cell line samples, we believe will be highly sought after by private researchers and universities for use in pre-clinical trial studies and in-vitro research due to our clinical processing methodology, donor sample data and the ability to create multiple cell types that have identical genetic profiles. We believe the clinical processing methods, data collection and testing of our ATCELL™ and the ability to make multiple cell types from the same donor line allows research teams to focus on application development and avoid bench to commercialization delays. The Company is preparing to distribute its ATCELL™ cell products to users of its ACSelerate™ cell culture media during 2017. The Company is investigating new sources of human mesenchymal cell lines for production and distribution to the cellular therapy research market.
 
ACSelerate™ Cell Culture Media Products – Manufactured patented cell culture media products for growing human stromal cells (including all cells found in human skin, fat and other connective tissue). Certain ACSelerate™ cell culture media lines are available in animal serum free, which is suitable for human clinical and therapeutic uses or a low serum version for application development and research purposes. The patented ACSelerate™ cell culture media line was specifically developed to address increasing industry demand for animal serum-free cell culture products and for the acceleration of products from the laboratory to the patient.

The Company recently entered into a licensing and manufacturing agreement with PeproTech a life sciences company formed in 1988. PeproTech is the trusted source for the development and manufacturing of high quality cytokine products for the life-science and cell therapy markets.  Over the past 26 years the company has grown into a global enterprise with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in the US, and offices around the world. With over 2,000 products PeproTech has developed and refined innovative protocols to ensure quality, reliability and consistency. During 2016 the Company and PeproTech completed the optimization and scale up manufacturing studies and expect the licensed medium marketed under both PeproTech’s PeproGrow and the Company’s ACSelerate MAX brands in 2017.
 
On August 2, 2011, the Company was issued US patent number 7,989,205 for “Cell Culture Media, Kits and Methods of Use.” The granted claims include media variations for cellular differentiation of ADSCs into osteoblasts (bone), chondrocytes (cartilage), adipocytes (fat), neural cells, and smooth muscles cells in both HSA medium (clinical) grade and FBS (research) grade. This patent covers both non-GMP research grades and GMP clinical grades suitable for cell culture of adipose-derived stem cells intended for use in humans. Additionally, in 2014 the Company filed a continuation of this granted patent with additional claims and improvements, U.S. Serial No. 13/194,900. On November 8, 2016 the Company was granted additional claims from the continuation U.S. Serial No. 13/194,900 issued as a new Patent Serial No. 9,487,755. Prior to the issuance the Company filed a continuation in part (CIP) containing additional claims related to our ongoing media development.
 Published cell culture research indicates the most widely used cell culture medium today for growing and differentiating stem cell cultures for in vitro diagnostics and research contains fetal bovine serum (FBS) and other animal derived products. The use of FBS and other animal products in clinical cellular therapy application development and manufacture raises concerns and generates debates within the scientific and regulatory community relating to potential human/animal cross-contamination. These same concerns may lead to additional expensive and expansive testing and documentation requirements with the FDA during the application and approval process for new cellular therapies manufactured with or containing animal or animal derived products. FDA concerns are evidenced in their Guidance’s and Guidelines regarding cellular therapy involving human cells, tissues and products (HCT/Ps) published and maintained by the FDA. Management believes that eliminating or greatly reducing FBS in cellular manufacturing, applications and products can eliminate or ease these scientific and regulatory concerns and may prove to be a winning strategy for cellular therapy application developers seeking FDA approval.
 Our media products are being utilized by our research partners engaged in developing novel new cellular applications and treatments. The Company supports these efforts by also making ATCELL™ samples available for research purposes and for internal product development through our research programs. We believe these cell lines are highly sought after by private researchers and universities for use in pre-clinical trial studies and in-vitro research. We also believe that the Company’s ability to provide clinical grade materials for these research and development collaborators, partners and other third parties extends the Company’s ability to become a primary source of clinical grade materials and services necessary to support approved applications and treatments.
 
The Company has created several versions of its ACSelerate™ cell culture media including:
 
· | ACSelerate-MAX™ - xeno serum free cell culture media, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ACSelerate-SFM™ - animal serum free cell culture media,;

The Company intends to expand its relationships and contract manufacturing regionally through its physician networks and globally through its International Licensing Program.
 
International Licensing Program – The Company believes that globally, many jurisdictions outside the US currently permit use of cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications. The Company has received numerous international inquiries concerning the sale or licensing of our SOPs, products and services in the Regenerative Medicine and Medical Tourism Markets. The Company believes that the inquiries to date are a result of the global boom in Medical Tourism, Regenerative and Personalized Medicine and the slow pace of approval of cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications in the US. To address the Company’s sales, marketing and branding opportunities globally, the Company has created its international licensing program. To date we have licensed our technologies in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China and, Tokyo, Japan.
 
The Company believes it can take advantage of the significant growth of the global cellular therapy market through its international licensing and marketing efforts. A recently published study by Transparency Market Research predicts that the Stem Cell market will grow at a CAGR of 24.2% upon its value of US $26.23 billion in 2013 and will reach an approximate value of US $119.52 billion by 2019. The report, titled “Stem Cells Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2012 - 2018”; which can be found at (http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/12/22/693419/10113247/en/Global-Stem-Cells-Market-to-grow-at-a-CAGR-of-24-2-to-Push-US-119-52-billion-by-2019-Transparency-Market-Research

Product Development
 Our strategic approach to product development is to design, develop and launch new products and services that utilize our existing products and services, i.e. the use of the CELLECT® collection materials by contracted companies to collect fresh tissue for their product. Management believes that allowing other biotech companies to utilize portions of our platform will provide the Company with additional opportunities to produce near term cash flow, strong recurring revenue streams, strong international licensing partners and complementary scientific data. We focus on developing products, services and applications that require tissue collection and processing as the initial requirement to produce cellular therapies and products. These products and services may include adipose tissue and stem cell sample processing and storage as a form of personal “bio-insurance”, adipose tissue (fat) storage for cosmetic fat engraftment procedures, and the creation and production of topical applications and ingredients used by other companies in the wound care and cosmetic industries as well as cellular applications and bio-materials development.
 
We focus our efforts on expanding our product and services pipelines based upon our intellectual property portfolio, collaborative development relationships, product sales, distribution, and international licensing and partnering opportunities. Our current activities include supporting university and industry collaborations by providing our products and services (ACSelerate™ and ATCELL™) with the expectation that our products and services become the basis for new adipose tissue and stem cell based Regenerative Medicine and cellular therapy applications. We believe this strategy allows our proposed research partners and their application development teams to begin with clinically harvested and processed adipose tissue and Adipose Derived Regenerative Cells ADRCs (ATCELL™), which may be a significant step toward accelerating the development and approval of new treatments.
 
Collaboration / Partnering Opportunities / Acquisitions
 PeproTech, Inc.
 On April 4, 2016 the Company entered into an Agreement with PeproTech, Inc of Rocky Hill, NJ. Under the Agreement PeproTech will manufacture, market and distribute the Company’s ACSelerate – Max cell growth medium. During 2016 the Company and PeproTech completed the optimization and scale up manufacturing studies and expect the licensed medium marketed under both PeproTech’s PeproGrow and the Company’s ACSelerate MAX brands in early 2017. PeproTech will leverage its current global sales relationships which reach a majority of all research laboratories worldwide to maximize distribution of the optimized media while the Company will concentrate its sales efforts on its collaborative and licensing partners.

We expect that the media will be initially released in the first quarter of 2017. 
 BioLife Customer and Physician Acquisition
 In February 2015 the Company entered into a binding asset purchase agreement with BioLife Cell Bank Dallas, LLC and BioLife Cell Bank Management, LLC (collectively “BioLife”), to purchase all of BioLife’s current adipose tissue, stem cell storage clients samples, and physician network. The transaction was concluded in March of 2015. Transfer of the adipose tissue samples was completed on April 24, 2015. The Company initiated annual storage fee billing to the acquired storage clients in June of 2015. Management believes that, with the acquisition of BioLife, the Company became one of the largest commercial adipose storage facilities in the United States.
 Additionally the Company acquired the physician customer list of approximately 60 cosmetic and plastic surgeons, and began marketing its services to all physician users of the BioLife services.
 Protein Genomics and Formation of Autogenesis Corporation
 In 2012, American CryoStem entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) outlining our initial collaborative efforts with Protein Genomics, Inc. (PGEN) to test and develop new products by combining certain components of our respective intellectual property and patented products. We have provided PGEN and its research partner, Development Engineering Sciences (DES), with Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ATCELL™) and our patented cell culture mediums (ACSelerate™) for testing with PGEN’s patented products designed for the wound healing market. Research and development has been ongoing since late 2012 and notable progress has been achieved.

-

In fiscal 2013 we entered into a formal joint venture with Protein Genomics through the incorporation of Autogenesis, Corp. as required by the 2012 MOU. Each company (CRYO and PGen) initially has an equal ownership interest. All products capable of being commercialized, as well as any new intellectual property, resulting from the ongoing scientific collaboration will be wholly-owned by Autogenesis. During 2013 and 2014, the collaborative efforts resulted in successful initial “proof of concept” combining PGEN’s unique biomaterial and the Company’s ATCELL™ and ACSelerate™ products. Management believes the preliminary results showed successful healing of full depth wounds on the backs of immune deficient mice. 
 Our collaborative research has established that membrane scaffolds fabricated from human proteins can be cultivated with ATCELL™ cells causing the scaffolds to be rapidly and completely covered by the cells. The cells then secrete their own extracellular matrix, creating a structure with layers of matrix, cells and scaffold. This living structure, when introduced into a mouse wound model, localizes the stem cells in the wound, protects the cells within the wound environment, promotes cell growth and causes a statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure and healing compared to the standard of care.  Further evaluation will measure the performance of these scaffolds in accelerating the rate of wound closure, healed scar thickness, growth of new blood vessels and production of key wound healing factors. Our objective is to show that these constructs can stimulate the growth of new tissue and promote wound closure and healing. 
 INTEGRA LifeSciences:
 On June 4, 2015, the Company and Autogenesis, Corp. entered into Non-Disclosure and Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) with Integra LifeSciences, under which the parties are exploring certain combinations of American CryoStem’s, ATCELL™ stem cells, its biomaterials product and Integra products and other biomaterials for the development of new products and services. Integra LifeSciences, a NYSE traded (INT) New Jersey based company, is a world leader in medical technology and wound healing. Integra offers innovative solutions, including leading regenerative technologies, in specialty surgical solutions, orthopedics and tissue technologies. (http://www.integralife.com/)
 Under the terms of the Agreement the Company will supply biomaterials and Company “know-how” to Integra and utilize its AGRFAFT™, CELLECT™, ATCELL™ and ACSelerate™ products for the development of new devices and biologic products for use with the co-developed biomaterials. To date the Company has delivered tropoelastin to Integra for use in the development of the new biomaterials and initiated the processing and testing of porcine (pig) adipose tissue for use in the initial animal studies. The Company is currently working with Integra to schedule additional work necessary to advance the product development in 2017. 
 Rutgers University
 In May of 2012, American CryoStem entered into Material Transfer Agreements with three research scientists at Rutgers University allowing them to utilize the Company’s autologous Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (ATCELL™) and patented, serum free, GMP grade cell culture and differentiation mediums (ACSelerate™) for evaluation with the anticipation to implement additional agreements to research, develop and commercialize innovative new cellular therapies targeting incurable diseases, neurological disorders and the $5 billion global wound care market.  
 During the last quarter of 2015 the Company undertook a review of the collaborative efforts between the Company and Dr. Lee pending the expiration of the agreements in November of 2015. Management believes that potential commercialization of the licensed technologies would require a number of years of additional study and experimentation and substantial investment by the Company. In November of 2015 the Collaboration and Research Agreement and the Licensing Agreement were terminated. The Company continues to discuss collaborations with Dr. Lee and the Rutgers Office of Technology Transfer for the continuing provision of our ATCELL™ and ATGRAFT™ products to Dr. Lee to support his continuing research.

(COI) located in Los Angeles, California to process adipose tissue and adipose derived cellular samples for future use in Regenerative Medicine. COI is a network of physicians interested in the development and use of adipose tissue and adipose derived cellular samples in regenerative therapies and cellular medicine. The Company has agreed to distribute its Cellect collection boxes and provide its ATGRAFT™ and ATCELL™ processing services under the COI brand for the collection, processing and storage of tissue samples at its NJ facility. Under the agreement, COI will pay the Company for the processing and storage of each sample generated by COI network physicians. COI plans to seek regulatory approval for use of the stored samples in clinical studies and trials utilizing adipose tissue processed into Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) and ultimately expanded adipose derived mesenchymal adult stem cells. The Company is incorporating its existing Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols into COI’s studies and may provide processing and other data to COI in support of their ongoing efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval of its cellular therapies. COI has initiated several IRB approved studies including a recently completed transportation study approved in August of 2016 to measure the survivability of cell shipped in a newly developed return transport medium, animal studies for traumatic brain injury approved in September of 2016, and the safety of intravenously delivered autologous ATCELL™ products approved in October of 2016. This initial work will become the basis for COI’s Investigational New Drug and Investigational Device Exemption filings with the FDA in 2017.
Additional Collaborations
 The Company is in the early stages of developing collaborations with additional industry and university partners. These developing relationships in their earliest stages are covered by Confidential Non-Disclosure Agreements and advanced to include Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) under which the Company supplies ATCELL™ and/or ACSelerate™ medium products for evaluation, testing, and the development of new cellular therapy applications.
 To date the Company has advanced to a Material Transfer Agreement with the University of Miami, University of Washington, UHV Technologies, and STEMCell Technologies and has provided both ATCELL™ and ACSelerate™ products to these entities under Agreement. No assurance can be given that these relationships will ultimately result in new technology for future commercialization. As of September 30, 2016 these relationships have yet to result in a commercial product.
 Additionally in August of 2015 the Company entered into a Confidential Disclosure Agreement and a Material Transfer Agreement with Dr. Sazlay, a research scientist currently investigating unique cancer treatments at the University of Wurzburg in Germany and the University of California in San Diego. Following execution of the Agreement, the Company delivered a number of ATCELL-SVF™, ATCELL™ and ACSelerate™ samples to Dr. Sazlay for testing and determination of usefulness of our products for development of his novel treatments. Dr. Sazlay has reported positive results of this initial work and the Company and Dr. Sazlay are currently negotiating additional collaborative agreements for further development.
Institutional Review Board Approval of Protocols 
 
In an effort to make it easier for other physicians and researchers to study the safety of SVF and ADSCs, in 2014 we sought approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Institute of Regenerative Medicine of our protocols for the processing of SVF and culturing of mesenchymal stem cells from autologous adipose tissue. The protocols provide appropriate processing, storage and testing methods necessary to move the clinical investigative process towards uniform treatments. The collection of processing and outcome data from IRB approved protocols is required by prevailing FDA regulations and guidance for approval of regenerative cellular therapies, including potency (cell count), contamination testing and cell viability. The objective of the IRB is to assess these protocols to ensure the highest patient safety possible and to minimize the risks for those participating in innovative research and investigational studies.
 
In June of 2014 the Company submitted its IRB Studies to the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Regenerative Cellular Medicine (the “IRCM”) and on July 23, 2014 the ICEM IRB approved the following studies:
 

· | Isolation of SVF: Autologous Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction Containing Adult Stem Cells (IRCM 2014-024) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Comparative Viability Assessment of Human Adipose Tissue Before and After Cryopreservation (IRCM 2014-025) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Isolation of SVF and Culturing Adipose Derived Stem Cells for Use in Investigational Review Board Studies (IRCM 2014-023) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The IRCM approved studies require annual renewal and the Company renewed the studies in 2015, and August of 2016.

The Company is currently making its processing services available to physicians and clinical researchers utilizing the IRB-approved protocols for inclusion in their studies. By adopting these standardized and repeatable protocols utilizing our laboratory services, researchers are able to focus their resources on application development rather than creating, validating and managing a clinical laboratory for processing tissue and cellular samples. These studies above do not currently involve actual human clinical trials, but affords the IRB the opportunity to endorse our repeatable, standardized and validated processing methodologies for the isolation of SVF and for tissue culture expansion of ADSCs obtained from SVF as the basis for future human clinical study.
 
In 2014, the Company created and is the Sponsor of a new IRB study with The DaVinci Center, in Georgetown, Grand Cayman Island entitled Impact and Safety of Cultured Expanded Autologous, Adipose-Derived Stem Cells deployed via Intravenous Injection for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis Protocol: CRYO-MS-ADSC-006. On July 23, 2014 the study was approved for 100 patients. On November 1, 2014 the first patient was treated at the Da Vinci Center utilizing the approved protocol. The IRB filing can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov, (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02326935). The Company renewed the IRB studies with The Institute of Regenerative Cellular Medicine in 2016 for another one year period. 
 
Management intends to pursue additional collaborative and partnering opportunities as a strategic method to enhance awareness of and expand the distribution of our patented products, services, technologies and expertise in the IRB-approved clinical processing of adult adipose tissue and ADSCs for autologous (self) use. We believe that as the pace of clinical trials and cellular therapy results reporting increase and scientific and peer reviewed papers are published, new opportunities to market our existing products, services and Intellectual Property portfolio may also emerge.
 
Moreover, we further believe that the combination of our validated cellular processing capabilities and patented products give us an economical platform to develop and produce cellular therapy applications for injection or intravenous therapy, topical applications, burn and wound healing, joint repair, disease treatments and cosmeticeuticals. The clinical methods and products we have developed are designed to permit a variety of treatments for any patient with their own genetically matched raw materials utilizing our ATCELL™ and ATGRAFT™ products prepared with our patented line of ACSelerate cell culture mediums. We believe that autologous cellular therapies have shown promising results for safety and efficacy in a variety of applications in published early stage clinical trial results and application studies.
 
Regulatory Information 
 
The Company believes that its processing methodologies and the laboratory facilities are designed to be in compliance with all current regulations as defined by the United States Public Health Service Act (“PHS” or the “PHS Act”) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations as they relate to the operation of a tissue processing and storage facility.
 
The Company’s New Jersey laboratory facility is registered with the FDA (FEI 3008307548) as a processing and storage facility for Human Cells, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue Based Products (HCT/Ps) since 2010. In 2013, we registered the facility with the State of New York (CP169TP136) and the State of California (CNC80948) the only states in the U.S. requiring registration. We have discussed our operations with the State of New Jersey Health Department and Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to ascertain any special regulations to which we may be subject. Based upon these discussions, and our use of a registered medical waste disposal company, we do not at this time have any special registrations or regulations for compliance with the State of New Jersey.
 
Our SOPs are the key to properly operating our clinical tissue processing facility. To ensure delivery of the highest quality services, we incorporate these SOPs, which are designed to provide a basis for accreditation by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) and the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT-JACIE). We have consistently endeavored to ensure that our processes, methodologies and procedures remain among the highest standards in the global tissue collection, processing and storage market. To this end, we have equipped ourselves with state-of-the-art quality processing and testing equipment, which we believe helps to ensure that every sample collected and processed is sterile (free from adventitious agents), viable and capable of significant cellular growth and expansion.
