Our Company
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing innovative protein therapeutics to improve the lives of patients with serious diseases. We currently have three product candidates in clinical development covering multiple potential indications. Each of our product candidates has an innovative mechanism of action and addresses patient populations for which better therapies are still needed. We have an emphasis in immuno-oncology, an area in which we have clinical and discovery programs and product and discovery collaborations. In addition, we plan to use companion diagnostics for our clinical programs where appropriate to allow us to select patients most likely to benefit from treatment. Our most advanced product candidates are identified below.

• | Cabiralizumab (FPA008) is an antibody that inhibits colony stimulating factor-1, or CSF1, receptor, or CSF1R, that we are studying in clinical trials as a monotherapy in pigmented villonodular synovitis, or PVNS, and in multiple cancers in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo® (nivolumab). In October 2015, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the cabiralizumab collaboration agreement, with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, pursuant to which we granted BMS an exclusive worldwide license for the development and commercialization of cabiralizumab.

• | FPA144 is an antibody that inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b, or FGFR2b, that we are initially developing to treat patients with gastric (stomach) cancer and is in a Phase 1 clinical trial.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FP-1039 is a fusion protein that “traps” and neutralizes cancer-promoting fibroblast growth factors, or FGFs, involved in cancer cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation that is in Phase 1b clinical development to treat patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a differentiated target discovery platform and library of more than 5,700 human transmembrane and extracellular soluble proteins that we believe encompasses substantially all of the body’s medically important targets for protein therapeutics. We have identified approximately 700 of these proteins, which we refer to as the immunome, that we believe modulate immune cell interactions and may be important in understanding and treating cancer patients using immuno-oncology therapeutics. Our target discovery platform and capabilities uniquely position us to explore pathways in cancer and inflammation and their intersection in immuno-oncology, an area of oncology with significant therapeutic potential and the focus of our research activities. We are applying all aspects of our biologics discovery platform, including cell-based screening, immunome-by-immunome screening, in vivo screening, receptor-ligand matching technologies and bioinformatics, in our immuno-oncology research program. We have identified several targets that we believe could be useful in immuno-oncology that we are actively validating, and we are also looking for additional targets. We generate and preclinically test therapeutic proteins, including antibodies and ligand traps containing or directed to the targets we identify. We plan to advance selected therapeutic candidates into clinical development, with a goal of filing at least one Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for a new molecule each year beginning in 2017.

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to use our differentiated target discovery platform and library to maintain our leadership position in the discovery of innovative protein therapeutic targets and to build a leadership position in the development and commercialization of immuno-oncology therapeutics. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

• | Focus on immuno-oncology protein therapeutics. Cancer therapeutics accounted for over $107 billion in global sales in 2015, and immuno-oncology therapeutics represent a growing portion of these sales. However, there continues to be significant medical needs for innovative and effective therapies to treat cancer. With the productivity of our target discovery platform and the significant experience and expertise of our research, preclinical and clinical scientists in the field of immuno-oncology, we believe we are well positioned to identify new targets and to develop effective, innovative protein therapeutics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to advance and expand our internal pipeline. Three of our product candidates, cabiralizumab, FPA144 and FP-1039, are currently in clinical development, and three others, FPA150, FPA154 and FPT155 are in IND-enabling studies. We plan to focus our resources on the further development of these product candidates, discovering and developing new therapeutic candidates with our platform, and potentially in-licensing additional product rights from third parties to expand our development pipeline.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish additional product and clinical collaborations to supplement our internal development capabilities and generate funding. From time to time, we expect to establish additional product and clinical collaborations. These collaborations will supplement our development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization capabilities, provide us with significant funding to advance our pipeline and validate our technology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a commercial enterprise by retaining rights for products in targeted specialty markets. We plan to build sales and marketing capabilities in selected specialty markets in the United States that we can adequately serve as we work toward becoming a focused commercial organization. We currently have global rights to all our product candidates, except for cabiralizumab. Our cabiralizumab collaboration agreement with BMS provides us with an option to co-promote cabiralizumab in the United States.

Clinical Programs
 Cabiralizumab
 Cabiralizumab is an antibody that inhibits CSF1R. CSF1R is a cell surface protein that controls the survival and function of certain immune response cells called monocytes and macrophages. Monocytes and macrophages are elevated or activated in multiple disease settings. In cancer, macrophages suppress the immune system’s ability to kill cancer cells. In joint diseases, macrophages contribute to inflammation and, in diseases such as PVNS, can form tumor masses. Cabiralizumab blocks the activation and survival of these cell types. In many cancers, inhibition of CSF1R reduces the number of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages, or TAMs, thereby facilitating an immune response against tumors. The staining images in Figure 1 below show the inhibitory effect cabiralizumab has on TAMs in a tumor model. We believe the combination of cabiralizumab with T cell checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 inhibitors, or immune agonists may have synergistic therapeutic effects in treating cancer.

Using our differentiated target discovery platform and library, we discovered a protein called interleukin-34, or IL-34, that is a key regulator of monocyte and macrophage numbers and activity. Once we discovered IL-34, we were able to use our protein library and ligand-receptor matching technology to identify its receptor, CSF1R. This receptor is known to be expressed on the surface of monocytes and macrophages. Before our discovery of IL-34, CSF1R was thought to have only one ligand called CSF1. Both CSF1 and IL-34 bind to and activate CSF1R and therefore promote the survival and activity of monocytes and macrophages. Cabiralizumab blocks the binding of both CSF1 and IL-34 to CSF1R and thereby inhibits the activity and survival of these cells (Figure 2).
 
Figure 2: Cabiralizumab Mechanism of Action
 
Cabiralizumab in Immuno-Oncology
 We believe that there is a strong rationale for combining cabiralizumab with checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer, including that:
  
• | TAMs are immunosuppressive and act by inhibiting CD8 T cell responses while enhancing recruitment and differentiation of regulatory T cells, or Tregs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TAMs often correlate with poor prognosis in cancer patients;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | TAMs appear to be sensitive to CSF1R inhibition; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | we believe that CSF1R inhibition in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies) or immune agonists (e.g., anti-CD40 antibodies) may synergistically induce tumor regressions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These points suggest that combining an anti-CSF1R antibody, such as cabiralizumab, with an anti-PD1 antibody, such as Opdivo, may benefit cancer patients. In preclinical studies, we observed cabiralizumab to be highly effective in blocking the growth of pancreatic tumors when combined with an anti-PD1 antibody and gemcitabine, as shown in Figure 3 below.
 Figure 3: Tumor Weight Reduction of Cabiralizumab in Combination with Anti-PD1 Antibody and Gemcitabine

We initially tested cabiralizumab in a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and rheumatoid arthritis subjects to obtain data on safety, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and biomarkers in doses of up to 10 mg/kg. During the trial, we administered cabiralizumab to a total of 54 subjects. All adverse events observed were Grade 1 or Grade 2, despite exposure to cabiralizubmab at doses up to 10 mg/kg, and were reversible. The most common treatment-related adverse event was eyelid/periorbital edema, which is a class effect for compounds targeting the CSF1R pathway. We observed modulation of CD14+CD16++ non-classical monocytes and bone turnover markers and dose-dependent increases in serum CSF1 and IL-34 levels in the trial, both of which demonstrated the anti-CSF1R effect of cabiralizumab.
 We are currently conducting a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of combining cabiralizumab with Opdivo as a potential treatment for a variety of cancers. The trial is currently expected to enroll approximately 280 patients. In October 2016, we initiated the Phase 1b portion of the trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the selected dose of cabiralizumab in combination with Opdivo in the following tumor settings:
 
 
• | second- or third-line non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC (anti PD-1 therapy naïve);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | anti-PD-1 therapy resistant NSCLC (either de novo or acquired resistance);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | second-line squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | second-line pancreatic cancer;
--+-------------------------------


• | third-line renal cancer;
--+-------------------------


• | third-line ovarian cancer; and
--+-------------------------------


• | second-line glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM.
--+---------------------------------------------

 We continue to enroll patients in an expansion of the Phase 1a portion of the trial to enable us to study the dose of cabiralizumab selected for expansion in the Phase 1b portion of the trial as monotherapy and as combination therapy with Opdivo in patients with certain tumor types beyond those addressed in the Phase 1b cohorts, including in patients whose tumors are refractory to PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. We are conducting these additional Phase 1a activities in parallel with  the Phase 1b portion of the trial.
 We also believe that cabiralizumab may have additive or synergistic therapeutic effects when combined with other T cell checkpoint inhibitors, in addition to PD-1 inhibitors such as Opdivo, or immune agonists. We plan to continue to evaluate the potential clinical development of cabiralizumab in combination with these other checkpoint inhibitors and immune agonists.
 Cabiralizumab in PVNS
 PVNS is a rare neoplastic joint disease, characterized by a locally aggressive tumor of the synovium. It is characterized by local overexpression of CSF1, which recruits macrophages into the joints, forming the non-malignant tumor mass. It is associated with high morbidity, and there are no approved therapies for the condition. We believe that administering cabiralizumab to PVNS patients will reduce infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into affected joints of these patients and inhibit the activity and survival of the monocytes and macrophages that form the bulk of the tumor mass, resulting in tumor shrinkage, pain reduction and increased use of the affected joint.
 There are two primary forms of PVNS: localized and diffuse. In localized PVNS, the tumor involves the tendons that support the affected joint or occurs in just one area of the affected joint. Localized PVNS is often surgically resectable and typically responds well to surgical treatment. Diffuse PVNS is more widespread throughout an entire joint, tends to be more destructive, may not be resectable and is more difficult to treat. We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of cabiralizumab as a potential treatment for diffuse PVNS. During the Phase 2 expansion portion of the trial, we are evaluating tumor response rate and duration and measures of pain and joint function in PVNS patients. We expect to complete patient enrollment in the planned Phase 2 portion of the trial in the first half of 2017. During 2017, we plan to seek guidance from regulatory authorities on advancing cabiralizumab to a pivotal trial in diffuse PVNS patients.

In January 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, granted cabiralizumab Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of PVNS. Orphan Drug Designation is granted by the FDA Office of Orphan Drug Products to products that treat rare diseases. The FDA defines rare diseases as those affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. 
 In December 2016, the European Commission, following an evaluation by the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, designated cabiralizumab as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of PVNS. The European Commission grants orphan medicinal product designation to products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. 
 Orphan Drug Designation in the United States and orphan medicinal product designation in the European Union each provide certain benefits and incentives in their respective jurisdictions, including a period of marketing exclusivity for the first marketing application if regulatory approval is received for the designated indication, potential tax credits for certain activities and waiver of certain administrative fees.
 FPA144
 FPA144 is an antibody that inhibits FGFR2b that we are initially developing to treat a subset of gastric (stomach) cancer patients whose tumors overexpress FGFR2b, as determined by an immunohistochemistry, or IHC, diagnostic test. This subset of tumors that overexpress the FGFR2b protein is associated with lower overall survival. We are working with a third party specializing in companion diagnostic development in order to develop an IHC companion diagnostic to identify gastric cancer patients who have FGFR2b overexpressing tumors and who would be most likely to benefit from treatment with FPA144. 
 We believe that FPA144 acts on tumor cells in two ways:
  
• | FPA144 binds to FGFR2b and blocks certain FGFs from binding to FGFR2b, preventing these FGFs from promoting the growth of the tumor cells; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | once FPA144 binds to FGFR2b on the surface of the tumor cell, FPA144 recruits natural killer, or NK, immune cells into the tumor microenvironment to kill the tumor cell in a process called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or ADCC.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical Development of FPA144. We are conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of FPA144 as a treatment for gastric cancer. We completed the dose escalation portion of the trial in 19 patients with solid tumors and 8 gastric cancer patients in 2016. We are currently enrolling patients in the expansion portion of the trial in which we are evaluating the safety, PK and efficacy of FPA144 in metastatic gastric cancer patients, with the aim of exploring the correlation between efficacy and FGFR2b overexpression. We are conducting tumor testing for FGFR2b overexpression centrally using a proprietary IHC assay to identify patients who have tumors that overexpress the FGFR2b protein. We are enrolling gastric cancer patients in four separate cohorts based on whether a patient’s tumor sample has high, moderate, low or no FGFR2b protein overexpression. We began enrollment in the cohorts of patients with high and no overexpression in November 2015. In the third quarter of 2016, we opened enrollment in the cohorts of patients with moderate and low overexpression.
 We also have opened for enrollment an additional cohort in this Phase 1 clinical trial to test FPA144 as a treatment for bladder cancer patients whose tumors overexpress FGFR2b.

In June 2016, we presented safety and tolerability data from 27 patients and PK data from 23 patients from our Phase 1 clinical trial at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO) 2016 Annual Meeting. In that trial, we tested FPA144 in advanced solid tumors up to 15 mg/kg in the first 40 patients. We did not observe any dose-limiting toxicities or a maximum-tolerated dose in Part 1. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were Grades 1 or 2 and self-limiting. Unlike small molecule FGF receptor kinase inhibitors, which block signaling through a broad number of FGF receptors and can lead to hyperphosphatemia, no treatment-related hyperphosphatemia was observed in patients treated with FPA144. The most common treatment-related adverse events were: fatigue (22.5%), nausea (20.0%), vomiting (12.5%), diarrhea (7.5%), dry eye (7.5%), keratitis (7.5%), an increase in lacrimation (7.5%) and pruritus (7.5%). 
 We observed preliminary anti-tumor activity with FPA144 monotherapy in patients with gastric cancer whose tumors overexpress the FGFR2b protein who were enrolled in the trial as well as an urothelial bladder cancer patient who was enrolled in the dose escalation portion of the trial. Based on radiographic assessments by RECIST 1.1 of anti-tumor activity in the nine patients who had FGFR2b-overexpressing gastric cancer, we observed, as of April 1, 2016, the data cutoff date:
  
• | three confirmed partial responses (one each at the 6 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg dose levels);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | four confirmed stable disease responses (one each at the3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose levels and two at the 15 mg/kg dose level); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two progressive disease responses (one each at the 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg dose levels).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also observed a confirmed complete response by computed tomography (RECIST 1.1) and metabolic response by PET in the urothelial bladder cancer patient who received 3 mg/kg in the dose escalation portion of the trial. Based on the activity observed, we tested the bladder cancer patient’s tumor for FGFRb expression and determined that the patient’s tumor overexpressed the FGFR2b protein. This observation suggests that FPA144 may be efficacious in tumors other than gastric with FGFR2b protein overexpression. 
 Because the observed incidence of gastric cancer is higher in Asian populations than in other populations, we plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan in the second half of 2017.
 We plan to initiate in 2017 a Phase 1b trial to evaluate FPA144 in combination with standard of care chemotherapy as a potential treatment for newly diagnosed or advanced gastric cancer patients. During 2017, we plan to seek guidance from regulatory authorities on our plans to advance FPA144 in combination with standard of care chemotherapy to a pivotal trial in first-line or second-line gastric cancer patients whose tumors overexpress FGFR2b. We plan to continue evaluating whether FPA144 may have use as a treatment for other types of cancer. 
 In conjunction with developing FPA144 as a therapeutic for gastric cancer, we are developing a proprietary IHC assay in collaboration with a diagnostic development company to use as a companion diagnostic to identify gastric cancer patients whose tumors overexpress FGFR2b. We plan to develop the companion diagnostic in parallel with our clinical development of FPA144 and to pursue regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic concurrently with regulatory approval of FPA144. In addition, we are investigating whether FGFR2b overexpression due to FGFR2 gene amplification can be detected in circulating tumor DNA, which is DNA shed from tumors that circulates in blood plasma outside of cells, to determine whether we can consider developing a blood-based (liquid biopsy) assay as a companion diagnostic to identify gastric cancer patients whose tumors overexpress FGFR2b.
 In April 2016, we presented preclinical data at the 2016 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting from our evaluation of the immune cell recruitment and anti-tumor effects of FPA144 in the orthotopic 4T1 model of breast cancer in mice.

Market Opportunity. Globally, gastric cancer is the sixth most common malignancy with the third highest mortality. In the United States, the prevalence of gastric cancer is approximately 74,000 patients, of which we believe approximately 3,700 have FGFR2 gene-amplified tumors that overexpress FGFR2b and are more likely to respond to FPA144, and globally, the prevalence of gastric cancer is approximately 1.5 million patients, of which we believe approximately 75,000 have FGFR2 gene-amplified tumors that overexpress FGFR2b and are more likely to respond to FPA144. 
 In June 2016, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to FPA144 for the treatment of gastric cancer, including cancer of the gastroesophageal junction in patients whose tumors overexpress FGFR2b. We believe that our clinical development organization is well suited to conduct such a focused, capital-efficient clinical development plan for FGFR2b overexpressing gastric cancer. 
 We plan to develop and commercialize FPA144 ourselves in the United States and possibly Canada and Europe. We plan to seek a collaborator to commercialize FPA144 in other countries.
 FP-1039
 FP-1039 is a protein therapeutic that we designed to “trap” and neutralize cancer-promoting FGFs. These FGFs act by binding to and activating fibroblast growth factor receptors, or FGFRs. FGFs and FGFRs regulate tumor cell proliferation and the growth of new blood vessels, a process called angiogenesis. The FGF family consists of 22 known proteins called ligands that exert their physiological effect on cells by binding to four FGFRs (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4). Dysregulation of the FGF pathway has been linked to the growth of human tumors and poor patient prognosis.
 FP-1039 may provide clinical benefit in certain tumor settings by trapping FGF ligands such as FGF-2 that are overexpressed or over-produced by tumor cells and promote tumor growth through angiogenesis. By triggering angiogenesis, cancerous cells can fuel their metabolic needs and direct their own uncontrolled cell division. Mesothelioma tumors have some of the highest overexpression levels of FGF-2 and is a tumor setting that has a high unmet need for effective treatments.
 Unlike other therapies directed to FGFR1 that indiscriminately block all FGFs, FP-1039 is designed to only block cancer-promoting FGFs that bind to FGF receptor 1, or FGFR1, and therefore may be associated with better tolerability than other known product candidates that target the FGF pathway less selectively, such as certain small molecule FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. For example, FP-1039 does not bind to an FGF called FGF-23, which regulates phosphate levels in the blood, and therefore FP-1039 does not change phosphate levels in the blood. This is in contrast to certain small molecule inhibitors of FGF receptors that block the activity of both cancer-associated FGFs and FGF-23 and are reported to cause abnormally high phosphate levels in the blood, a condition known as hyperphosphatemia. High phosphate levels can lead to calcification in tissues, including blood vessels. We expect that FP-1039 could be used in dosages high enough to fully block cancer-promoting FGFs, and that it has the potential to be safely combined with standard of care chemotherapy.
 Clinical Development of FP-1039. We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of FP-1039 designed to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of single-agent FP-1039 administered weekly to 39 subjects with a variety of metastatic tumors. During the Phase 1 clinical trial, no maximum tolerated dose was observed and FP-1039 treatment was not associated with hyperphosphatemia or retinal detachment. We also studied blood levels of FGF-2, one of the most important cancer-promoting FGFs, and observed a significant decrease of FGF-2 in all patients tested.
 In March 2011, we licensed to Human Genome Sciences, Inc., or HGS, rights to develop and commercialize FP-1039 in the United States, the European Union and Canada. In August 2012, GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, acquired HGS and HGS is now a wholly owned subsidiary of GSK. HGS/GSK terminated its license to FP-1039 for convenience effective September 5, 2016. 
 10

Prior to GSK’s termination of the FP-1039 license, GSK had initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial of FP-1039 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dosage, response rate and duration of response of FP-1039 in combination with front-line pemetrexed and cisplatin in malignant pleural mesothelioma, or MPM, patients. In June 2016, GSK completed enrollment of MPM patients at an expansion dose of 15 mg/kg in the Phase 1b clinical trial and GSK is currently dosing and following patients that remain on the study. Pursuant to the terms of the FP-1039 license, we elected to have GSK complete the conduct of this Phase 1b clinical trial, at GSK’s expense. 
 In June 2016, GSK presented preliminary clinical safety and efficacy data from the Phase 1b trial in mesothelioma patients at the ASCO 2016 Annual Meeting. We and GSK plan to present updated response rate, duration of response and progression-free survival data from the Phase 1b clinical trial at a scientific or medical conference in the second half of 2017.
 Market Opportunity. We believe there are currently no approved therapies that specifically block FGFs or FGFRs. We believe selected patients with FGF pathway dysregulation, which has been linked to the growth of human tumors and poor patient prognosis, would be most likely to benefit from treatment with FP-1039. Mesothelioma has the highest FGF-2 levels among various cancers that we have evaluated and a majority of mesothelioma patients have tumors with abnormally high levels of FGF-2. Mesothelioma is an orphan indication in the United States with a prevalence of about 4,000 patients and incidence of about 3,000 patients. Worldwide, there are a total of approximately 14,000 cases of mesothelioma diagnosed each year.
 We will base decisions on any future development of FP-1039 in mesothelioma on overall safety as well as the objective response rate, disease control rate, and progression-free survival duration in the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial and other business considerations, such as drug supply and manufacturing.
 Preclinical Programs
 FPA150
 FPA150 is a CD8 T cell checkpoint inhibitor antibody that targets B7-H4. B7-H4 is a member of the B7 family of checkpoint inhibitors and shares significant homology with the other B7 family members, including PD-L1 and PD-L2. B7-H4 is expressed in several human tumors, including breast, ovarian, endometrial, lung and pancreatic cancers, and its expression correlates with poor prognosis. We designed FPA150 to target tumor cells through two distinct mechanisms of action: (i) by blocking B7-H4 from sending an inhibitory signal to CD8 T cells, and (ii) by enhancing ADCC against B7-H4-expressing tumor cells.
 We are currently conducting IND-enabling activities for FPA150, with the goal of filing an IND in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
 FPA154
 FPA154 is a tetravalent agonistic antibody that activates glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor, or GITR. We identified GITRL, the ligand that binds to and activates GITR, as one of the most potent inhibitors of tumor growth in our in vivo screens. GITR is a protein that is selectively expressed on effector T cells and regulatory T cells, or Tregs, and is believed to activate an immune response against tumor cells. GITR expression is highest on activated and intratumoral Tregs. As a tetravalent antibody, FPA154 promotes more efficient GITR crosslinking and signaling through GITR than conventional bivalent GITR antibodies and is designed to have improved CD8 T cell activity in conjunction with significant Treg depletion activity. In preclinical studies, agonist antibodies such as FPA154 have demonstrated the ability to induce tumor regressions, particularly when administered in combination with other immuno-oncology therapies, such as PD-1 antibodies.
 We are currently conducting IND-enabling activities for FPA154, with the goal of filing an IND in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
 11

FPT155
 FPT155 is a soluble CD80-Fc fusion protein that modulates three signaling pathways that we believe increases CD8 T cell activation against tumor cells. CD80 is a member of the B7 family of checkpoint inhibitors that is involved in modulating T cell priming and activation. We believe FPT155 activates the CD8 T cell activating receptor CD28 and reduces tumor cells’ ability to evade CD8 T cells by binding to and blocking CTLA-4 and PD-L1, both of which are checkpoint inhibitors. FPT155 was one of the most potent tumor inhibitors that we identified in our in vivo screens of more than 500 immunome proteins. 
 We are currently conducting IND-enabling activities for FPT155, with the goal of filing an IND in 2018. 
 Immuno-Oncology Drug Discovery and Research Programs
 Overview. We are currently focusing our internal research efforts in the area of immuno-oncology. Cancers grow and spread because tumor cells have developed ways to evade elimination by the immune system. For example, cancer cells make proteins that apply the “brakes” to immune cells and prevent the immune cells from killing the tumor cells. One of the most exciting recent discoveries in cancer therapy has been the identification of ways to release these “brakes” and allow the immune cells to once again kill tumor cells. This new approach has the potential to not only reduce tumor growth like traditional therapies, but also to potentially eliminate the cancer entirely in some patients. In addition to releasing the “brakes” on immune cells, other recent discoveries in cancer therapy have focused on identifying ways to “press on the gas” to amplify the anti-tumor immune response. This second approach targets stimulatory pathways on immune cells. Agents that agonize stimulatory pathways can help immune cells overcome inhibitory signals in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in tumor cell killing. 
 While checkpoint inhibitor therapies have been validated in the clinic with agents targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways to release the “brakes,” a significant proportion of patients do not respond to these treatments. New targets for immuno-oncology are needed to address those patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate traditional therapies or agents currently in development. We are applying all aspects of our differentiated target discovery platform to identify protein partners for molecules known to be involved in the anti-tumor immune response. We believe we have identified promising new antibody targets and ligand traps and are actively researching and validating additional immuno-regulatory targets. 
 Our Biologics Discovery Platform. We are focused on discovering and developing innovative protein therapeutics. Targets for protein therapeutics are proteins in the body that when inappropriately produced or altered can result in human diseases. Protein therapeutics can be designed to reverse these disease-causing mechanisms. There are more than 5,700 proteins in the body that represent potential protein therapeutic targets or therapeutics themselves, but only a few are targeted by currently marketed protein drugs in immuno-oncology, such as PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, IL-2, interferon alpha and CD3. 
 Traditional ways to discover new targets for protein therapeutics have relied on a slow “trial-and-error” approach studying a single or a small number of proteins at a time. We have developed a platform to improve the traditionally difficult and slow process of discovering new protein therapeutic targets. The platform is based on two components:
  
• | a proprietary library of more than 5,700 human extracellular proteins that we believe is the most comprehensive collection of fully functional extracellular proteins and is an abundant source of medically relevant novel targets for protein therapeutics; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proprietary technologies and know-how for producing and testing in in vitro, in vivo and other assays thousands of proteins at a time to identify potential protein drugs and antibody candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12

We believe our platform improves and accelerates the discovery of new drug protein targets and protein therapeutics because it can:
  
• | identify novel medically relevant protein targets and protein therapeutics that have little or no previously known biological function or are not in the public domain and cannot easily be discovered by other methods;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | identify new drug targets more quickly and efficiently than previously possible because it can produce and test thousands of proteins at a time rather than one or just a few at a time.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have used our platform to identify dozens of targets validated in rodent models in several different disease areas, including in collaboration with our partners, and to build a growing pipeline of product candidates. We believe our platform is particularly well positioned to explore new pathways in immuno-oncology. 
 Growing Database of Protein Function. We have tested each of the proteins in our library in numerous screens on different cell types, providing us with an extensive database of information regarding how each protein performs in different screens and whether it is specific to a given disease process or has a broader range of activities. The cumulative data from all the screens allows us to identify the most appropriate target.
Collaborations 
 A part of our strategy is to establish product and clinical collaborations. These collaborations supplement our development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization capabilities, provide us with significant funding to advance our pipeline and validate our technology. A summary of our key product, clinical and discovery collaborations is set forth below.
 Cabiralizumab Collaboration Agreement with BMS
 In October 2015, we entered into the cabiralizumab collaboration agreement with BMS, pursuant to which we granted to BMS an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize certain CSF1R antibodies, including cabiralizumab, and all modifications, derivatives, fragments or variants of such antibodies, each of which we refer to as a licensed antibody. The cabiralizumab collaboration agreement superseded the clinical trial collaboration agreement that we entered into with BMS in November 2014, or the clinical trial collaboration agreement. 
 Under the terms of the cabiralizumab collaboration agreement, BMS is responsible, at its expense, for developing cabiralizumab, under a development plan, subject to our option, at our own expense, to conduct certain future studies, including registration-enabling studies to support approval of cabiralizumab in PVNS and in combination with our proprietary internal or in-licensed compounds, including in oncology, each of which we refer to as a Five Prime independent development path. BMS will have the option prior to our commencement of a clinical trial with respect to a Five Prime independent development path to include any such clinical trial in BMS’s development plan, and BMS would thereafter bear the associated development costs and milestone payments to us with respect to BMS’s development of such Five Prime independent development path. If BMS elects to include in the development plan what would have been a Five Prime independent development path clinical trial, BMS would reimburse us for our development expenses incurred since November 2015, the effective date of the cabiralizumab collaboration agreement, with respect to such Five Prime independent development path. 
 If BMS does not add a Five Prime independent development path to the development plan before the review of any efficacy data from the first Phase 3 or registration-enabling clinical trial in such Five Prime independent development path, and such Five Prime independent development path indication achieves regulatory approval in the United States or marketing approval in the European Union or Japan, then BMS will reimburse us an amount equal to 125% of our development expenses with respect to such Five Prime independent development path.
 13

We continue to conduct the current Phase 1a/1b clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of combining Opdivo with cabiralizumab in multiple tumor types. BMS bears all costs and expenses relating to the current trial, including manufacturing costs for the supply of cabiralizumab, except that we are responsible for our own internal costs, including internal personnel costs. 
 BMS is responsible for manufacturing and commercialization of cabiralizumab, and we retain rights to a minority co-promotion option in the United States. 
 Pursuant to the cabiralizumab collaboration agreement, BMS paid us an upfront fee of $350 million. Additionally, we are eligible to receive up to (i) $505.0 million in specified developmental and regulatory milestone payments for all combination therapies of cabiralizumab with Opdivo; (ii) $542.5 million in specified developmental and regulatory milestone payments for combination therapies of cabiralizumab with one or more of BMS’ or our proprietary products, at least one of which is not Opdivo, in the field of oncology; and (iii) $340.0 million in specified developmental and regulatory milestone payments for therapeutic uses of cabiralizumab in PVNS and non-oncology indications. 
 In the event that we achieve a milestone with respect to a particular disease or combination (other than any PVNS-related milestones) under our development rights under the cabiralizumab collaboration agreement, the milestone payment associated with such milestone would be deferred and become payable to us by BMS after cabiralizumab receives regulatory approval in the United States or marketing approval in the European Union or Japan in such disease or combination.
 BMS will also be obligated to pay us, with respect to each licensed product in each country, tiered percentage royalties ranging from the high teens to the low twenties, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, on worldwide net sales of such licensed product until the latest of (i) the expiration of certain patents covering such licensed product in such country, (ii) the date on which any applicable regulatory, pediatric, orphan drug or data exclusivity with respect to such licensed product expires in such country, (iii) the date of the first commercial sale in such country of a biosimilar product with respect to such licensed product or (iv) 12 years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. BMS will be obligated to pay us an additional low single-digit percentage royalty on net sales in the United States in the event we exercise our co-promotion option. We cannot determine the date on which BMS’s potential royalty payment obligations to us would expire because BMS has not yet developed any licensed products under the agreement and therefore we cannot identify the date of the first commercial sale or any related patents covering or regulatory exclusivity periods with respect to such licensed product.
 Unless earlier terminated by either party, the cabiralizumab collaboration agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of BMS’s payment obligations with respect to each licensed product under the agreement. BMS may terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a region-by-region basis at any time with advance written notice. BMS may also terminate the agreement in its entirety (or on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis) upon written notice based on certain safety reasons. Either party may terminate the agreement in its entirety with written notice for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure the breach. We may terminate the agreement in its entirety with written notice for BMS’s material breach of its diligence obligations with respect to development and obtaining marketing approval, and may terminate the agreement on a region-by-region basis for BMS’s breach of its diligence obligations with respect to timely commercialization of a licensed product in a region following marketing approval. Either party also may terminate the agreement in its entirety upon certain insolvency events involving the other party.
 GSK Muscle Diseases Collaboration 
 In July 2010, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement, or the muscle diseases collaboration, with Glaxo Group Limited, or GSK, to identify potential drug targets and drug candidates to treat skeletal muscle diseases. We conducted three customized cell-based screens and one in vivo screen of our protein library under the muscle diseases collaboration. The research term under this collaboration ended in May 2014. In September 2014, GSK exercised its option under the muscle diseases collaboration to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to an undisclosed muscle disease target we identified using our proprietary target discovery platform. 
 14

The muscle diseases collaboration agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the royalty terms of any products that incorporate or target the protein exclusively licensed under the collaboration. In addition, GSK may terminate the agreement at any time with advance written notice, and either party may terminate the agreement with written notice for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure the breach or upon certain insolvency events. 
 For information regarding the financial terms of the muscle diseases collaboration, including amounts we have received through December 31, 2016, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Overview – Collaboration and License Revenue.” 
 GSK Respiratory Diseases Collaboration 
 In April 2012, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement, or the respiratory diseases collaboration, with GSK to identify new therapeutic approaches to treat refractory asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, function, with a particular focus on identifying novel protein therapeutics and antibody targets. We conducted six customized cell-based screens of our protein library under the collaboration. In January 2016, we amended the respiratory diseases collaboration to extend the research term to allow for the conduct of additional activities to validate protein targets we discovered in our screens and to increase the research funding that GSK was obligated to pay us under the collaboration. The research term for this collaboration ended in July 2016. 
 In the course of screening our protein library in the respiratory diseases collaboration, we discovered proteins that may be potential drug targets or drug candidates for treating refractory asthma or COPD. GSK has the right for limited periods of time to evaluate proteins identified in the screens we conducted and obtain an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize products that incorporate or target such proteins. 
 Prior to the time GSK exercises its right to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to a protein target, we will discuss and agree on track 1 targets, for which GSK will have sole responsibility for the further development and commercialization of products that incorporate or target such protein targets, and track 2 targets, for which we will develop biologics that incorporate or target such protein targets through to clinical proof of mechanism in either a phase 1 or phase 2 clinical trial. We will take into consideration each party’s available resources and capabilities at the time in deciding which protein targets will be track 1 targets or track 2 targets, but subject to each party’s general right to alternate in such selection and with GSK to have the right to first select. 
 The respiratory diseases collaboration agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the royalty terms of any products that incorporate or target a protein exclusively licensed under the collaboration. In addition, GSK may terminate the agreement at any time with advance written notice, and either party may terminate the agreement with written notice for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure the breach or immediately in the case of failure to comply with certain anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies or upon certain insolvency events. 
 For information regarding the financial terms of the respiratory diseases collaboration, including amounts we have received through December 31, 2016, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Overview – Collaboration and License Revenue.”
 UCB Fibrosis and CNS Collaboration 
 In March 2013, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with UCB, referred to as the fibrosis and CNS collaboration, to identify innovative biologics targets and therapeutics in the areas of fibrosis-related immunologic diseases and central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We conducted five customized cell-based and in vivo screens of our protein library under the fibrosis and CNS collaboration. We completed our initial research activities under the fibrosis and CNS collaboration by in March 2016. Following the completion of the research activities, UCB has up to a two-year evaluation period during which we may be obligated to perform additional services at UCB’s request. 
 15

In the course of screening our protein library in the collaboration we discovered proteins that may be potential drug targets or drug candidates for fibrosis-related immunologic diseases. Under the collaboration, UCB has the right for limited periods of time to evaluate proteins identified in the screens we conducted and obtain an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize products that incorporate or target the protein. If UCB elects to obtain an exclusive license to a protein it has evaluated, UCB would have sole responsibility for the further development and commercialization of products that incorporate or target the protein, at UCB’s cost and expense. 
 The collaboration agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the royalty terms of any products that incorporate or target a protein exclusively licensed under the collaboration. In addition, UCB may terminate the agreement at any time with advance written notice, and either party may terminate the agreement with written notice for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure the breach or upon certain insolvency events. 
 For information regarding the financial terms of the fibrosis and CNS collaboration, including amounts we have received through December 31, 2016, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Overview – Collaboration and License Revenue.”
 BMS Immuno-oncology Research Collaboration 
 In March 2014, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with BMS, or the immuno-oncology research collaboration, pursuant to which we and BMS are collaborating to carry out a research program to (i) discover novel interacting proteins in two undisclosed immune checkpoint pathways, which we refer to as the checkpoint pathways, using our target discovery platform; (ii) further the understanding of target biology with respect to targets in these checkpoint pathways; and (iii) discover and pre-clinically develop compounds suitable for development for human therapeutic uses against targets in these checkpoint pathways. Based on data arising from our initial screens, in January 2016, we amended the immuno-oncology research collaboration to add an additional checkpoint pathway to the research program, for a total of three undisclosed immune checkpoint pathways.
 The initial three-year research term of the immuno-oncology research collaboration will end in March 2017. BMS exercised its option to extend the research term for an additional year to March 2018. BMS has an option to extend the research term for one additional year. 
 In connection with entering into the immuno-oncology research collaboration, BMS made an upfront payment of $20.0 million to us. Through December 31, 2016, we received $9.0 million of research funding and are eligible to receive up to an additional $2.5 million of research funding through the end of the initial three-year research term and the additional one-year extension term. We are eligible to receive up to $240.0 million per collaboration target in specified developmental, regulatory and commercialization contingent payments comprising aggregate developmental contingent payments of up to $53.0 million, aggregate regulatory contingent payments of up to $74.0 million and aggregate commercialization contingent payments of up to $113.0 million. We are also eligible to receive up to $60.0 million in sales-based contingent payments per collaboration product. 
 For each commercialized product under the immuno-oncology research collaboration that is directed toward a target in the checkpoint pathways, BMS is also obligated to pay us tiered mid-single digit to low double-digit percentage royalties, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, on net sales of such product for the longer of (i) 12 years after the first commercial sale of such product, (ii) the life of certain patents licensed covering such product or (iii) the date on which any applicable regulatory, pediatric, orphan drug or data exclusivity with respect to such product expires. We cannot determine the date on which BMS’s potential royalty payment obligations to us would expire because BMS has not yet commercialized any products under the immuno-oncology research collaboration, and we therefore cannot identify the date of the first commercial sale or any related patents covering such product. 
 16

Unless earlier terminated by either party, the immuno-oncology research collaboration will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of all of BMS’s payment obligations under the immuno-oncology research collaboration agreement. BMS may terminate the immuno-oncology research collaboration agreement in its entirety or on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis at any time with advance written notice. Either party may terminate the immuno-oncology research collaboration agreement in its entirety or on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis with written notice for the other party’s material breach if such other party fails to timely cure the breach. Either party also may terminate the immuno-oncology research collaboration agreement in its entirety upon certain insolvency events involving the other party. 
 In connection with the immuno-oncology research collaboration agreement, BMS purchased 994,352 shares of our common stock at a price of $21.16 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $21.0 million. 
 License Agreements 
 License Agreement with Inhibrx
 In July 2015, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement, or the GITR license agreement, with INBRX 110 LP, or Inhibrx, pursuant to which we obtained (a) an exclusive, worldwide license to multivalent antibodies to GITR for therapeutic and diagnostic uses, which we refer to respectively as licensed therapeutic products and  licensed diagnostic products, and (b) an exclusive option, or the option, to obtain exclusive, worldwide licenses to multi-specific antibodies developed by Inhibrx that bind to both GITR and other targets, each of which we refer to as a multi-specific product. We can exercise an option with respect to a multi-specific product within a limited period of time after (i) the occurrence of certain activities related to initiating clinical manufacturing of such multi-specific product or (ii) if not earlier exercised, the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial of such multi-specific product. 
 Pursuant to the GITR license agreement, we paid Inhibrx an upfront fee of $10.0 million. Additionally, with respect to each licensed therapeutic product, we will be obligated to pay up to $62.5 million in specified development milestone payments and (i) if such licensed therapeutic product does not receive a Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA, up to $280.0 million in specified regulatory and commercial milestone payments, or (ii) if such licensed therapeutic product receives a Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA, up to $380.0 million in specified regulatory and commercial milestone payments. We may pay all or a portion of milestone payments for development and regulatory events in shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions. We would be obligated to register for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, any such shares of our common stock.
 If we exercise our option with respect to a multi-specific product at manufacturing initiation, we would pay Inhibrx $15.0 million for such option exercise. If we exercise our option with respect to a multi-specific product at Phase 2 dosing, we would pay Inhibrx $30.0 million for such option exercise. After such option exercise, such multi-specific product would be treated as a licensed therapeutic product under the GITR license agreement and we would be obligated to pay the milestone payments specified above with respect to such multi-specific product. 
 Inhibrx is also eligible for low double-digit tiered royalties on future product sales for licensed therapeutic products and low single-digit tiered royalties on future product sales for licensed diagnostic products, in each case, for the longer of (i) 12 years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product or (ii) the life of certain patents licensed covering such licensed product. 
 17

Unless earlier terminated by either party, the GITR license agreement will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of all of our payment obligations under the GITR license agreement. For each licensed product, we are obligated to pay Inhibrx milestone payments upon achievement of certain milestone events for such licensed product, and we are obligated to pay royalties on net sales of such product on a country-by-country basis for the longer of the life of the licensed patents covering such product in such country or 12 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. We cannot determine the date on which our royalty payment obligations to Inhibrx would expire because no commercial sales of FPA154 have occurred and the last-to-expire relevant patent covering FPA154 in a given country will be determined in the future. Currently, Inhibrx has pending U.S. and international patent applications, which we have licensed, covering FPA154. Patents that may issue from these pending patent applications would expire in 2036. This patent expiration date does not reflect any patent term extensions that may be available, which are not determinable at this time.
 We may terminate the agreement in its entirety at any time with advance written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement in its entirety with written notice for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure the breach. Either party also may terminate the agreement in its entirety upon certain insolvency events involving the other party. 
 License Agreement with Galaxy 
 In December 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Galaxy Biotech LLC, or Galaxy, pursuant to which Galaxy granted us an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize FGFR2b antibodies, including FPA144. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product in at least one tumor indication. We paid Galaxy an upfront license fee of $3.0 million in connection with our entry into the license agreement. In May 2016, we amended the license agreement to revise certain milestone definitions, reduce certain milestone payments and add certain development-related milestone payments that were triggered by dosing of certain patients in the current Phase 1 clinical trial of FPA144, which milestones were deemed achieved as of December 31, 2016. 
 Through December 31, 2016, we made milestone payments to Galaxy totaling $5.1 million. We are obligated to pay Galaxy additional milestone payments of up to $86.9 million comprising aggregate intellectual property-related milestone payments of up to $1.4 million, development-related milestone payments of up to $14.0 million for development in two indications, aggregate regulatory-related milestone payments of up to $41.5 million for two indications and aggregate commercial-related milestone payments of up to $30.0 million. We are also obligated to pay tiered royalties on net sales of FPA144 from the high-single digits to the low-double digits. 
 Our license agreement with Galaxy will remain in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations under the license agreement in all countries. For each licensed product, we are obligated to pay Galaxy royalties on net sales of such product on a country-by-country basis for the longer of the life of the licensed patents covering such product in such country or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. We cannot determine the date on which our royalty payment obligations to Galaxy would expire because no commercial sales of FPA144 have occurred and the last-to-expire relevant patent covering FPA144 in a given country may change in the future. Currently, Galaxy has an issued patent, which we have licensed, covering FPA144 in the United States that expires in 2029. Galaxy patents that may issue in other countries, including in Europe and Japan, from pending patent applications would expire in 2029. These patent expiration dates do not reflect any patent term extensions that may be available, which are not determinable at this time. 
 We may terminate the license agreement for convenience in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis upon prior written notice to Galaxy. Either party may terminate the license agreement in its entirety or with respect to certain countries after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in certain circumstances in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. Either party may terminate the license agreement in the event of the other party’s filing or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceeding or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of its assets for the benefit of creditors. Galaxy may terminate the license agreement if we or any of our affiliates challenge the validity or enforceability of any patent licensed to us by Galaxy under the license agreement or if we aid or assist any affiliate or third party in such a challenge other than as required by law. 
 18

Non-Exclusive License with BioWa-Lonza 
 In February 2012, we entered into a license agreement with BioWa, Inc. and Lonza Sales AG, or BioWa-Lonza, pursuant to which BioWa-Lonza granted us a non-exclusive license to use their Potelligent® CHOK1SV technology, including the CHOK1SV cell line, and a non-exclusive license to related know-how and patents. This license is necessary to produce our FPA144 antibody. 
 We are obligated to pay BioWa-Lonza aggregate milestone payments of up to $25.4 million for development, regulatory and commercialization milestones achieved in our FPA144 antibody program. We are also obligated to pay BioWa-Lonza tiered royalties on net sales of FPA144 up to mid-single digit percentages of the proceeds of such sales. 
 Our license agreement with BioWa-Lonza will remain in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations. For each licensed product, we are obligated to pay BioWa-Lonza royalties on net sales of such product on a country-by-country basis for the longer of the life of the licensed patents covering such product in such country or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in a major market country, which includes the United States. However, because we believe the last-to-expire patents currently licensed to us under the license agreement would expire in less than 10 years, we believe the date on which our royalty payment obligations to BioWa-Lonza would expire in any country would be 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in a major market country. 
 We may terminate the license agreement for convenience subject to our continuing obligation to pay royalties. BioWa-Lonza may terminate the license agreement in the event of our uncured material breach, if we oppose or dispute the validity of patents licensed to us under the license agreement or if we are declared insolvent, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, are the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or have a receiver or trustee appointed for substantially all of our property. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates and other biological discoveries relating to new targets, pathways and relevant inventions and technologies that are important to our business. For our product candidates, we generally initially pursue patent protection covering both compositions of matter and methods of use. 
 Throughout the development of our product candidates, we seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through additional methods of use, combination therapy, biomarker and companion diagnostic related claims. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our discovery platform and product candidates and seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 Our success will also depend significantly on our ability to obtain rights to intellectual property held by third parties that may be necessary or useful to our business, including for the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates. We generally obtain rights to third-party intellectual property through exclusive or non-exclusive licenses. For example, we have entered into a non-exclusive license with BioWa-Lonza to use their Potelligent® CHOK1SV technology, which is necessary to produce our FPA144 antibody. If we are not able to obtain rights to intellectual property held by third parties that are necessary or useful to our business, our business could be harmed, possibly materially. 
 19

The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly limited before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 The patent portfolios for our three most advanced programs are summarized below: 
 Cabiralizumab 
 Our cabiralizumab patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications wholly owned by us as well as patents jointly owned with BMS. Our patent portfolio includes issued U.S. and foreign patents as well as pending U.S. and foreign patent applications covering compositions of matter, methods of use, biomarkers and combination therapies relating to cabiralizumab. The issued U.S. patents and issued foreign patents covering the composition of matter and methods of use expire in 2031. Patents that may issue from the pending U.S. and foreign applications would expire between 2031 and 2036. 
 FPA144 
 Our patent portfolio for FPA144 includes patents and patent applications we exclusively licensed from Galaxy, as well as pending U.S. and foreign patent applications wholly owned by us. The patent portfolio, covering compositions of matter, methods of use, companion diagnostic and combination therapy relating to FPA144, includes issued U.S. and foreign patents as well as pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. The issued U.S. patents expire between 2029 and 2030. The issued foreign patents expire in 2029. Patents that may issue from these pending U.S. and foreign applications would expire between 2029 and 2036. 
 FP-1039 
 Our patent portfolio for FP-1039 includes patents and patent applications wholly owned by us, as well as patents we exclusively license from UC Regents. 
 The FP-1039 patent portfolio that we wholly own includes issued patents and pending patent applications covering compositions of matter, methods of use, including certain combination therapies and dosing regimens, and biomarkers relating to FP-1039. This patent portfolio includes patents issued in the United States and foreign countries. The issued patents expire between 2026 and 2031. The FP-1039 patent portfolio that we wholly own also includes pending U.S. and foreign patent applications covering composition of matter and methods of use. Patents that may issue from these pending U.S. and foreign patent applications would expire between 2026 and 2034. 
 The FP-1039 patent portfolio also includes issued U.S. and foreign patents we exclusively license from the UC Regents that cover composition of matter and methods of producing FP-1039. These exclusively licensed patents include issued U.S. patents covering composition of matter and methods of producing FP-1039 that expire between 2019 and 2020. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. 
 20

In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. 
 Manufacturing 
 We have process development and small-scale, non-clinical manufacturing capabilities. We generally perform cell line and process development for our product candidates and manufacture quantities of our product candidates necessary to conduct preclinical studies of our investigational product candidates. We do not have and we do not currently plan to acquire or develop the facilities or capabilities to manufacture bulk drug substance or filled drug product for use in human clinical trials or commercialization. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce bulk drug substance required for our clinical trials and expect to continue to rely on third parties to manufacture clinical trial drug supplies for the foreseeable future. BMS has the exclusive right to manufacture cabiralizumab drug substance and filled drug product. BMS will supply us with cabiralizumab, at its cost and expense, for our use in the conduct of the current trial and our Phase 2 clinical trial of cabiralizumab in patients with PVNS and will supply us with cabiralizumab for the conduct of our independent cabiralizumab development activities in exchange for a pre-negotiated service fee. We also contract with additional third parties for the filling, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of investigational drug products. We have personnel with significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality and project management experience to oversee our third-party manufacturers and to manage manufacturing and quality data and information for regulatory compliance purposes. 
 We must manufacture drug product for clinical trial use in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements and FDA satisfaction before any product is approved. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of our products. Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. 
 21

Commercialization 
 We have not yet established sales, marketing or product distribution operations. We generally expect to retain some commercial rights in the United States for our product candidates in specialty markets. Pursuant to our cabiralizumab collaboration agreement, we have a co-promotion right in the United States which, if we exercise, will allow us to field a minority percentage of the total United States sales force promotional effort. If we exercise our option to co-promote cabiralizumab in the United States prior to submission of a biological license application, or BLA, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization in the United States. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which cabiralizumab is being developed. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by continuing technological advancement and significant competition. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any companion diagnostics. The level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates protein therapeutics like cabiralizumab, FPA144, FP-1039 and our other product candidates as biological drug products, or biologics, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and related regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial actions. These actions could include the suspension or termination of clinical trials by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, revocation of a biologics license, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, import detention, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any administrative or judicial action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of biologics. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, purity, potency, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping and reporting, approval, import and export, advertising and promotion and post-market surveillance of our products. 
 22

The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of any future product candidates or approval of product or manufacturing changes, new disease indications, or label changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. 
 Biologics Marketing Approval 
 The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | nonclinical laboratory and animal tests;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | submission of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic for its intended use or uses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA approval of a BLA, which must occur before a biologic can be marketed or sold.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any new approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Our planned clinical trials for our product candidates may not begin or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in: 
  
• | obtaining regulatory approval to commence a study;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | reaching agreement with third-party clinical trial sites and their subsequent performance in conducting accurate and reliable studies on a timely basis;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtaining IRB approval to conduct a study at a prospective site;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | recruiting patients to participate in a study; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | manufacturing or obtaining supply of the investigational product and related materials, such as companion diagnostics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any compound in human subjects, a company must develop extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act and related regulations. 
 Prior to commencing the first clinical trial in humans, an initial IND application must be submitted to the FDA. A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans. The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such case, the IND application sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND application must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed consent must also be obtained from each study subject. Regulatory authorities, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 23

A study sponsor is required to submit to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public posting on NIH’s clinical trial website details about certain active clinical trials and clinical trial results. For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in phases that may overlap: 
  
• | Phase 1—the biologic is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, reactivity, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. These studies may also provide early evidence of effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational product’s effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—studies are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—when Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the product appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 clinical trials, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the FDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All of these trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes. 
 Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approvals for any future product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. 
 The Biologic License Application Approval Process 
 In order to obtain approval to market a biologic in the United States, a BLA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product for the proposed indication. Each BLA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. 
 The FDA will initially review the BLA for completeness before it accepts it for filing. Under the FDA’s procedures, the agency has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, which includes determining whether it is effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP, and to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 24

During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh its risks. A REMS may include various elements depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. These elements range from a medication guide or patient package insert to training and certification requirements for prescribers and/or pharmacies to safe use conditions that must be in place before the drug is dispensed. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the BLA sponsor must submit a proposed REMS or the FDA will not approve the BLA. 
 Based on pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial results submitted in a BLA, at the discretion of the FDA or upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant a priority review designation to a product, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from the FDA’s 60-day filing date for the BLA rather than the standard 12 months. Priority review is given for a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products or offer a therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
 After the FDA completes its review of a BLA, it will either communicate to the sponsor that it will approve the product, or issue a complete response letter to communicate that it will not approve the BLA in its current form and to inform the sponsor of changes that the sponsor must make or additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the FDA can approve the application, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the sponsor may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Resubmitting a BLA in response to a complete response letter can add additional time to the approval process for a product. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the BLA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 The testing and approval process for a biologic requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and this process may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. 
 The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 clinical trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing product approval. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. Conversely, the results of Phase 4 clinical trials can raise new safety or effectiveness issues that were not apparent during the original review of the product, which may result in product restrictions or even withdrawal of product approval. In addition, the FDA has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency. If any of our products are subject to these additional postmarketing requirements and commitments, there may be resource and financial implications for our business.
 25

Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval will be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and/or dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution, or post-marketing study or trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, requirements to conduct additional studies or trials, or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action. 
 FDA Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences with the biologic, and submitting biological product deviation reports to notify the FDA of unanticipated changes in distributed products. Manufacturers are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP standards. This requires us and our third-party manufacturers to implement certain quality processes, manufacturing controls and documentation requirements in order to ensure that the product is safe, has the identity and strength, and meets the quality, purity and potency characteristics that it purports to have. Certain states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, refuse to approve any BLA or other application, force us to recall a drug from distribution, shut down manufacturing operations or withdraw approval of the BLA for that biologic. Noncompliance with cGMP or other requirements can result in issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures, and injunctive action. 
 The FDA and other federal and state agencies closely regulate the labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs. While doctors may prescribe any product approved by the FDA for any use as long as consistent with any REMS restrictions, if applicable, a company can only make claims relating to safety and efficacy of a product that are consistent with FDA approval, and the company is allowed to market a drug only for the particular use and treatment approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make relating to our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions, potential civil and criminal penalties, criminal prosecution, and agreements with governmental agencies that materially restrict the manner in which we may promote or distribute drug products. Government regulators, including the Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities, recently have increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs. 
 Orphan Drug and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation and Exclusivity 
 The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which are generally diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a sponsor demonstrates that a biologic is intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (Public Law 108-155), submission of a pediatric assessment is not required for pediatric investigation of a product that has been granted orphan drug designation. 
 The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from FDA user fees. Orphan designation, however, does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Generally, if a product that receives orphan designation is approved for the orphan indication, it receives orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same use. Additionally, if a biologic designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. 
 26

Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or provides a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication or disease, which could create a more competitive market for us. 
 After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the applicant, as well as the name of the therapeutic agent and its designated orphan use, are disclosed publicly by the FDA. 
 Similarly, the European Commission grants orphan medicinal product designation to products intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating affecting not more than five in 10,000 people. In order to receive orphan designation, there must also be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition, or if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. In addition, sponsors are required to submit to the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or the PDCO, and comply with a pediatric investigation plan, or a PIP, in order to seek marketing authorization in the EU.
 Designated orphan medicinal products are entitled to a range of incentives during the development and regulatory review process, including scientific assistance for study protocols, a partial or total reduction in fees and eligibility for conditional marketing authorization. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity in all EU member states. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of such product. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is established to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. After five years, a member state can request that the period of market exclusivity be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated the criteria for orphan designation no longer apply and the medicine is sufficiently profitable. The period of market exclusivity may be extended by two years for medicines that have also complied with an agreed PIP. 
 Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created a licensure framework for biosimilars, which could ultimately subject our biological product candidates to competition from biosimilars. Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an abbreviated application for licensure of a biologic that is “biosimilar to” a referenced branded biologic. This abbreviated approval pathway is intended to permit a biosimilar to come to market more quickly and less expensively than if a “full” BLA were submitted, by relying to some extent on the FDA’s previous review and approval of the reference biologic to which the proposed product is similar. 
 Under the BPCIA, a biosimilar sponsor’s ability to seek or obtain approval through the abbreviated pathway is limited by periods of exclusivity granted to the sponsor of the reference product. No biosimilar application may be submitted until four years after the date of approval of the reference product, and no such application, once submitted, may receive final approval until twelve years after that same date (with a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results are reported to the FDA). Once approved, biosimilar products likely would compete with (and in some circumstances may be deemed under the law to be “interchangeable with”) the previously approved reference product.
 27

FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 As part of our clinical development plans, we plan to engage third party collaborators to develop companion diagnostics to identify patients most likely to respond to our product candidates. Companion diagnostics are classified as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the United States. In the United States, the FDA regulates the medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, reporting, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, export and import, sales and distribution, and post-market surveillance of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostics require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA. According to a 2014 guidance issued by FDA officials, the use of companion diagnostics with therapeutic products raises important concerns about the safety and effectiveness of both the companion diagnostic devices and the corresponding therapeutic products and, therefore, ordinarily will require a PMA before they are marketed. Some companion diagnostics, however, could potentially be cleared through 510(k) clearance. 
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a “predicate device,” which is a previously 510(k) cleared Class I or Class II device, a pre-amendment Class III device for which the FDA has not yet called for PMA applications or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the applicant must show that the device has the same intended use and the same technological characteristics as the predicate, or if the device has different technological characteristics than the predicate, the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness, and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from four to twelve months, but it can last longer. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires either a new 510(k) clearance or a PMA. 
 A product not eligible for 510(k) clearance must follow the PMA pathway, which requires proof that there is a reasonable assurance to the FDA’s satisfaction of a device’s safety and efficacy and its intended use with a corresponding therapeutic product. Because the diagnostic tests that we plan to develop are essential for the safety and effective use of our therapeutics in selected patients, these diagnostic tests would be subject to the PMA approval process
 The PMA process is costly, lengthy and uncertain. PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For companion diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA application is required by statute to take between six to ten months. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application, and where practical, will identify what is necessary to secure approval of the PMA. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and the data then submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, a PMA may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 28

We and any third-party collaborator who we engage to develop companion diagnostics will work cooperatively to generate the data required for submission with the PMA application, and will remain in contact with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, at the FDA to ensure that any changes in requirements are incorporated into the development plans. We anticipate that meetings with the FDA with regard to our drug product candidates, as well as companion diagnostic product candidates, will include representatives from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or the CDER, and CDRH to ensure that the BLA and PMA submissions are coordinated to enable the FDA to conduct a parallel review of both submissions. The 2014 guidance issued by the FDA addresses issues critical to developing companion diagnostics, such as biomarker qualification, establishing clinical validity, the use of retrospective data, the appropriate patient population and when the FDA will require that the device and the drug be approved simultaneously. According to the draft guidance, if safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on a diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. We plan to structure our programs for the development of our companion diagnostics to be consistent with this guidance. 
 In the European Economic Area, or the EEA, in vitro medical devices are required to conform with the essential requirements of the E.U. Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Directive No 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance with these essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA. We expect our companion diagnostic will require a conformity assessment through an accredited EEA Notified Body, and that the data generated for the U.S. registration will be sufficient to satisfy the regulatory requirements for the European Union and other countries.
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Such third-party payors include government health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and managed care providers, and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is granted, the reimbursement rates paid for covered products might not be adequate. Even if favorable coverage status and adequate reimbursement rates are attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The marketability of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement to allow us to sell such products on a competitive and profitable basis. For example, under these circumstances, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer our products and patients may decline to purchase such products. This, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success. 
 The market for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on the degree to which these products are listed on third-party payors’ drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included on such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor may individually establish coverage and reimbursement policies, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement can be a time-consuming and costly process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. 
 29

Anti-Kickback, False Claims and Physician Payment Sunshine Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing, several other types of U.S. state and federal laws are relevant to certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and their other interactions with health care providers. These laws include the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, false claims statutes, and the Federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act. We are subject to these laws and they may affect our business. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and subsequent legislation, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions; however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. 
 The Federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced investigations and private lawsuits and, in many cases, have agreed to significant and burdensome settlements under these laws for a variety of allegedly improper promotional and marketing activities, including inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates; providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe products; or engaging in promotion for “off-label” uses. Federal False Claims Act violations may result in significant civil monetary penalties, including three times the damages incurred by the government from the violation. The majority of U.S. states also have statutes or regulations similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, and in some states apply regardless of the payor. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters.
 The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to track payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests, and to publicly report such data. Manufacturers subject to the Open Payments Program must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year. Failure to comply with the reporting obligations may result in civil monetary penalties.

Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, some states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal or state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant criminal and civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, even if they are approved for sale. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical and medical device industries have been a particular focus of these efforts and have been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. 
 In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the Affordable Care Act that are repealed. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved. 
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

Other Regulations 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
