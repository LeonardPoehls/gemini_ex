ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms “we,” “us,”  “our,” or “our Company” are used to mean The Navigators Group, Inc., a Delaware holding company established in 1982, and its subsidiaries.  The term “Parent Company” is used to mean The Navigators Group, Inc. without its subsidiaries.
 
We are an international insurance company with a long-standing area of specialization in Marine insurance. We also offer Property and Casualty (“P&C”) insurance, which consists primarily of general liability coverage and umbrella & excess liability coverage to commercial enterprises through our Primary and Excess Casualty divisions. We have also developed niches in Professional Liability insurance, through our Directors & Officers (“D&O”) and Errors & Omissions (“E&O”) divisions, as well as assumed reinsurance products.
 We operate through various wholly-owned insurance and service companies. Our subsidiaries domiciled in the United States (“U.S.”) include two insurance companies, Navigators Insurance Company (“NIC”) and Navigators Specialty Insurance Company (“NSIC”), as well as our U.S. underwriting agency, Navigators Management Company, Inc. (“NMC”). NIC includes a branch in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). We also have operations domiciled in the U.K., Hong Kong and Europe. Navigators International Insurance Company Ltd. (“NIIC”), Navigators Management (U.K.) Ltd. (“NMUK”) and Navigators Underwriting Ltd. (“NUL”) are domiciled in the U.K. and NUL includes European branches. Navigators Underwriting Agency Ltd. (“NUAL”), a Lloyd’s of London (“Lloyd’s”) underwriting agency, manages and provides the capital, through Navigators Corporate Underwriters Ltd. (“NCUL”), for our Lloyd’s Syndicate 1221 (the “Syndicate”), and is also domiciled in the U.K. We control 100% of the Syndicate’s stamp capacity. 
 Effective January 1, 2017, we sold our underwriting agency operations in Sweden and Denmark. The transaction represented a 100% disposition of our Sweden and Denmark corporations, NUAL AB and Navigators A/S, respectively. This transaction did not materially impact our results of operation, financial condition or liquidity.
 During the first quarter of 2017, our new U.K. based insurance company, NIIC, which is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of our Parent Company, began writing business.
 On December 18, 2017, we entered into a share purchase agreement for the purchase of all of the shares of Assurances Continentales – Continentale Verzekeringen NV (“ASCO”) and Bracht, Deckers & Mackelbert NV (“BDM”). ASCO and BDM are both based in Antwerp, Belgium. The proposed acquisition is part of our strategy of expanding our well-established specialty insurance expertise to more brokers and insureds across Europe. As aggregate consideration for the acquisition of ASCO and BDM, we will pay EUR 35 million in cash at the closing of the transaction. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including among other things, the receipt of regulatory approval, and is anticipated to close in the first half of 2018.
 Segment Information
 We report our results of operations consistent with the manner in which our Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews the business to assess performance of our four reporting segments: U.S. Insurance, International Insurance (“Int’l Insurance”), GlobalRe and Corporate. The U.S. Insurance and Int’l Insurance reporting segments are each comprised of three operating segments: Marine, P&C and Professional Liability.

Products and Distribution
 Our Company distributes insurance related products through international, national, regional and retail insurance brokers. No customer or broker accounted for more than 10% of consolidated gross premiums written.

Competitive Environment
 Our Company faces competition from both domestic and foreign insurers, many of whom have longer operating histories and greater financial, marketing and management resources. Competition in the types of insurance in which our Company is engaged is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies, pricing, other terms and conditions of products and services offered, business experience, business infrastructure, global presence, marketing and distribution arrangements, agency and broker relationships, quality of customer service (including speed of claims payments), product differentiation and quality, operating efficiencies and underwriting. Furthermore, insureds tend to favor large, financially strong insurers, and our Company faces the risk that we will lose market share to these larger insurers. Another competitive factor in the industry is the entrance of underwriting organizations and other financial services providers, such as banks and brokerage firms, into the insurance business. These efforts pose new challenges to insurance companies and agents from financial services companies traditionally not involved in the insurance business.  We strive to offer superior service, which we believe has differentiated us from our competitors. Our Company pursues a specialist strategy and focuses on market opportunities where we can compete effectively based on service levels and product design, while still achieving an adequate level of profitability. Our Company has grown, in part, from the leveraging of cross-marketing opportunities with our other operations to take advantage of our organization's global presence.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 732 full-time employees of which 555 were located in the United States, 149 in the United Kingdom, 8 in The Netherlands, 6 in Hong Kong, 5 in Italy,  3 in France, 2 in Belgium, 2 in Switzerland, 1 in Singapore and 1 in Spain. 
Loss Reserves
 Loss reserves are estimates of what the insurer or reinsurer expects to pay on claims, based on facts and circumstances then known. It is possible that the ultimate liability may exceed or be less than such estimates. In setting the loss reserve estimates, our Company reviews statistical data covering several years, analyzes patterns by line of business and considers several factors including trends in claims frequency and severity, changes in operations, emerging economic and social trends, inflation and changes in the regulatory and litigation environment. We also consult with experienced claims professionals. Based on our analysis, we make a best estimate of our ultimate liability.  During the loss settlement period, which, in some cases, may last several years, additional facts regarding individual claims may become known and, accordingly, it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim upward or downward. Such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in our current period’s earnings. Even then, the ultimate liability may exceed or be less than our revised estimates. Our reserving process is intended to provide implicit recognition of the impact of inflation and other factors affecting loss payments by taking into account changes in historical payment patterns and perceived probable trends. There is generally no precise method for the subsequent evaluation of the adequacy of the consideration given to inflation, or to any other specific factor, because the eventual strengthening or release of reserves is affected by many factors, some of which are interdependent.

Our Company maintains reserves for unpaid losses and unpaid loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) for all lines of business. Loss reserves consist of both reserves for reported claims, known as case reserves, and reserves for losses that have occurred but have not yet been reported, known as incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) losses.  In the normal course of business, our Company cedes a portion of our premium to reinsurers through treaty and facultative reinsurance agreements.  Although reinsurance does not discharge our Company from liability to our policyholders, our Company participates in reinsurance agreements to limit our loss exposure and to protect us against catastrophic losses.
 There is a lag between the time premiums are written and related losses and LAE are incurred, and the time such events are reported to us. The loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business. Short tail business refers to claims that are generally reported quickly upon occurrence of an event and involve little or no litigation, making estimation of loss reserves less complex. The long tail business includes our Marine Liability product as well as various other insurance products in our P&C and Professional Liability operating segments. For the long tail lines, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may elapse between the occurrence of the loss, the reporting of the loss and the settlement of the claim. Generally, the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim, the more likely the ultimate settlement amount will vary from the original estimate.
 The following table presents the development of our loss and LAE reserves for 2007 through 2017. Net reserves for losses and LAE reflects our net reserves at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years and represents our estimated amount of losses and LAE arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date. Reserves for losses and LAE re-estimated in the table reflect our re-estimated amount of our previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. Our reserve estimates may change as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years. Our net and gross cumulative redundancy (deficiency) in the table reflects our cumulative amounts developed as of successive years with respect to the aforementioned reserve liability. Our cumulative redundancy (deficiency) represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years.
 The table calculates losses and LAE reported and recorded for all prior years starting with the year in which the loss was incurred. For example, assuming that a loss occurred in 2007 but was not reported until 2008, the amount of such loss will appear as a deficiency in both 2007 and 2008. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future strengthening or releases based on the table.
 A significant portion of our favorable or adverse development on the gross reserves has been ceded to the excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties.  As a result of these reinsurance arrangements, our gross losses and related reserve strengthening and releases tend to be more sensitive to favorable or adverse developments such as those described above than our net losses and related reserve strengthening and releases.

As part of our overall investment strategy, we seek to build a tax efficient investment portfolio. 
 Our investments are managed by outside professional fixed-income and equity portfolio managers.  We seek to achieve our investment objectives by investing in cash equivalents and money market funds, municipal bonds, sovereign bonds, government agency guaranteed and non-guaranteed securities, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, common and preferred stocks, and exchange traded funds. The Finance Committee of our Board of Directors approves our overall group asset allocation targets and investment policy to ensure that they are consistent with our overall goals, strategies and objectives.    
 Our regulated insurance companies’ investments are subject to the oversight of their respective Boards of Directors and the Finance Committee of our Parent Company’s Board of Directors.  Our investment portfolio and the performance of the investment managers are reviewed quarterly.  Our investments within NIC and NSIC must comply with the insurance laws of New York State, the domiciliary state of NIC and NSIC.  These laws prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments which may be made by insurance companies.  In general, these laws permit investments, within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications, in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, structured securities, preferred stocks, common stocks, real estate mortgages and real estate.
 Our investments supporting our Int’l Insurance business must also comply with the regulations set forth by the PRA in the U.K.  Our investments supporting business at Lloyd’s and NIIC are subject to the direction and control of the Boards of Directors and the Investment Committees of NUAL and NIIC, as well as our Parent Company’s Board of Directors and Finance Committee.

 Regulation
 United States
 Our Company is subject to regulation under various insurance statutes, including holding company statutes of various states and applicable regulatory authorities in the United States.  These regulations vary but generally require insurance holding companies, and insurers that are subsidiaries of holding companies, to register and file reports concerning their capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations.  Such regulations also generally require prior regulatory agency approval of changes in control of an insurer and of certain transactions within the holding company structure.  The regulatory agencies have statutory authorization to enforce their laws and regulations through various administrative orders and enforcement proceedings.
 State insurance regulations are intended primarily for the protection of policyholders rather than stockholders. The state insurance departments monitor compliance with regulations through periodic reporting procedures and examinations. The quarterly and annual financial reports to the state insurance regulators utilize statutory accounting principles, which are different from generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) that we use in our reports to stockholders. Statutory accounting principles, in keeping with the intent to assure the protection of policyholders, are generally based on a solvency concept, while GAAP is based on a going-concern concept.
 The state insurance regulators utilize risk-based capital measurements, developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized. The NAIC’s risk-based capital model is intended to establish minimum capital thresholds that vary with the size and mix of an insurance company’s business and assets. It is designed to identify companies with capital levels that may require regulatory attention. At December 31, 2017, each of our domestic insurance companies’ total adjusted capital was significantly in excess of the authorized control level risk-based capital.
 The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or action by insurance regulatory authorities. Generally, regulators will begin to investigate or monitor an insurance company if its IRIS ratios fall outside usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. Based on our most recent statutory filings (calculated as of December 31, 2017), none of our U.S. insurance companies are subject to regulatory scrutiny based on these ratios.

In 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act, which, following enactment at the state level became effective in 2015. ORSA requires U.S. insurance companies and their groups to regularly, but no less than annually: 1) conduct an assessment of the adequacy of its risk management framework and current and estimated future solvency position, 2) internally document the process and results of such assessment and 3) provide a confidential, high level summary of such assessment to certain state regulatory authorities. This year we filed our ORSA report with the New York State Department of Financial Services on December 1, 2017, and we believe we have a robust Enterprise Risk Management framework in place that is effective in meeting the ORSA requirements.
 The U.S. state insurance regulations also regulate the payment of dividends and other distributions by insurance companies to their stockholders. Generally, insurance companies are limited by these regulations in the payment of dividends above a specified level. Dividends in excess of those thresholds are “extraordinary dividends” and are subject to prior regulatory approval. While New York only requires approval of extraordinary dividends, some states require prior regulatory approval for all dividends.
 Because we are an insurance holding company, we are subject to the insurance holding company system regulatory requirements of a number of states. Under these regulations, we are required to report information regarding our capital structure, financial condition and management. We are also required to provide prior notice to, or seek the prior approval of, the Department of Financial Services of certain agreements and transactions between our affiliated companies. These agreements and transactions must satisfy certain regulatory requirements.
 Government intervention has also occurred in the insurance and reinsurance markets in relation to terrorism coverage in the U.S. (and through industry initiatives in other countries). The U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which was enacted in 2002 to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for certain terrorist acts in the U.S., was extended in 2015 for six years, through December 31, 2020, and applies to certain of our product offerings.
 On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and contains various provisions that will affect corporations, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from a 35% maximum rate to a 21% flat rate, changes to net operating loss carryback and carryforward rules and changes to U.S. taxation of foreign profits. See the risk factor Changes in tax laws could increase our corporate taxes, reduce our deferred tax assets or affect pricing of some of our products in Item 1A – Risk Factors for additional information regarding the impact of the Tax Act.
 United Kingdom
 Our U.K. branch, NIIC and the Syndicate are all subject to regulation by the PRA (for prudential issues) and the FCA (for conduct of business issues). The Syndicate is also subject to supervision by the Council of Lloyd’s.  The PRA and FCA have been granted broad authorization and intervention powers as they relate to the operations of all insurers, including Lloyd’s syndicates, operating in the U.K.  Lloyd’s is regulated by the PRA and FCA and is required to implement certain rules prescribed by them, which it does by the powers it has under the Lloyd’s Act 1982 relating to the operation of the Lloyd’s market.  Lloyd’s prescribes, in respect of its managing agents and corporate members, certain minimum standards relating to their management and control, solvency and various other requirements.  The PRA and FCA also monitor Lloyd’s managing agents’ compliance with those systems and controls. If it appears to the PRA and/or the FCA that either Lloyd’s is not fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities, or that managing agents are not complying with the applicable regulatory rules and guidance, the PRA and/or FCA may intervene at their discretion.
 The Council of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting at Lloyd’s.  It may, for instance, change the basis on which syndicate expenses are allocated or vary the required amount of capital to be held by a corporate member of Lloyd’s in support of its business (“Funds at Lloyd’s”) or the investment criteria applicable to the provision of Funds at Lloyd’s.  Exercising any of these powers might affect the return on an investment of the corporate member in a given underwriting year (“UWY”).  Further, it should be noted that the annual business plans of a syndicate are subject to the review and approval of the Lloyd’s Franchise Board.  The Lloyd’s Franchise Board is responsible for setting risk management and profitability targets for the Lloyd’s market and operates a business planning and monitoring process for all syndicates.  
 The U.K. branch, NIIC and the Syndicate are required to meet the requirements of the European Union’s (“the E.U.”) financial services regulatory regime known as “Solvency II,” which is built on a risk-based approach to setting capital requirements for insurers. Solvency II established a revised set of the E.U.-wide capital requirements and risk management standards, which became effective on January 1, 2016, with certain aspects of Solvency II concerning compliance with supervisory reporting and disclosure requirements effective in 2017.  Over the last few years, our Company has undertaken a significant amount of work to ensure that it meets the requirements of Solvency II for all of its affected entities, and will continue its efforts to ensure that it meets such requirements.
