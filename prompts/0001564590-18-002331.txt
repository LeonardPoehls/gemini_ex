Overview
 Pendrell Corporation (“Pendrell”), with its consolidated subsidiaries, is referred to as “us,” “we,” or the “Company.” Pendrell has, for the past six years, invested in, acquired and monetized intellectual property (“IP”) rights. In 2017, we divested the majority of our largest IP portfolio, known as our “Pendragon” portfolio, but continued to license the digital rights management (“DRM”) patents owned by our subsidiary ContentGuard Holdings, Inc. (“ContentGuard”), and the memory and storage patents owned by our subsidiary Memory Technologies LLC (“MTL”). We will continue efforts to license those DRM and memory patents in the future. 
 Pendrell was originally incorporated in 2000 as New ICO Global Communications (Holdings) Limited, a Delaware corporation. In July 2011, we changed our name to Pendrell Corporation. On November 14, 2012, we reincorporated from Delaware to Washington. Our principal executive office is located at 2300 Carillon Point, Kirkland, Washington 98033, and our telephone number is (425) 278-7100. Our website address is www.pendrell.com.

 Our Business
 Revenue Generating Activities
 We generate revenues by licensing and selling our IP rights to others. Our subsidiaries hold patents that support three IP licensing programs that we own and manage: (i) memory and storage technologies, (ii) digital media, and (iii) digital cinema. 
 We acquired most of our memory and storage patents (our “Memory Patents”) and patent applications from Nokia Inc. in March 2013, many of which have been declared essential to standards that are applicable to memory and storage technologies used in electronic devices. These patents cover embedded memory components and storage subsystems. Potential licensees include flash memory component suppliers, solid state disk manufacturers and device vendors. Since 2014, we have entered into license agreements with five leading memory device makers and a number of smaller companies in the memory space. We are in active license discussions with other memory component manufacturers and, early in 2018, filed litigation against Kingston Technology Corporation (“Kingston”) in federal district court alleging infringement of certain of our memory and storage patents (“Kingston Litigation”).

Our digital media program is supported by patents (our “DRM Patents”) and patent applications designed to protect against unauthorized duplication and use of digital content during the transfer of the digital content. The majority of our digital media patents and patent applications came to us through our October 2011 purchase of a 90.1% interest in ContentGuard, where we partnered with Time Warner to expand the development and licensing of ContentGuard’s portfolio of DRM technologies. We have granted digital media licenses to manufacturers, distributors and providers of consumer products, including Amazon, DirecTV, Fujitsu, LG Electronics, Microsoft Corporation, Nokia, Panasonic, Pantech, Sharp, Sony, Toshiba, Time Warner and Xerox Corporation. 
 Our digital cinema program is supported by DRM Patents and patent applications designed to protect against unauthorized creation, duplication and use of digital cinema content that is distributed to movie theaters globally, many of which also came to us through our acquisition of ContentGuard. Potential digital cinema licensees include distributors and exhibitors of digital content, including motion picture producers, motion picture distributors and equipment vendors. We launched our digital cinema program in June 2013, and signed a significant license with The Walt Disney Company in 2017. We are actively engaged in licensing discussions with other leading feature film studios. 
 In late 2017, we divested the majority of our “Pendragon portfolio,” which contained patents related to cellular and digital wireless devices and infrastructure. We are actively working to divest the remainder of the portfolio. 
 We typically license our patents via agreements that cover entire patent portfolios or large segments of portfolios. We expect licensing negotiations with prospective licensees to take approximately 12 to 24 months, and perhaps longer, measured from inception of technical discussions regarding the scope of our patents. If we are unable to secure reasonable, negotiated licenses, we may resort to litigation to enforce our IP rights, as evidenced by the claims we filed in 2016 against SanDisk at the ITC and in federal district court, and the claims we recently filed against Kingston in federal district court.
Our IP revenue generation activities are not limited to licensing and litigation. Patents that we believe may generate greater value through a sales transaction, such as the Pendragon portfolio, may be sold. Although some may characterize patent sale revenue differently than patent license revenue, we regard our IP monetization activities as integrated and not separate revenue streams, and therefore treat sale and license revenue the same for GAAP reporting purposes.
 Our IP portfolio currently consists of patents that have already expired and others that expire between 2018 and 2035.  See “Revenue opportunities from our IP monetization efforts are limited” under “Item 1A of Part I—Risk Factors.”
 Business Outlook
 From 2011 through 2015, we focused on acquiring and growing companies that developed or possessed unique, innovative technologies that could be licensed to third parties or could provide a competitive advantage to products we were developing. During the past three years, we moderated those efforts and reduced our costs by eliminating certain positions, reducing certain overhead costs and abandoning patent assets that do not support our existing licensing programs. In December 2017, we delisted from Nasdaq and filed for de-registration of our Class A common stock. 
 We have explored and continue to explore investment opportunities that are not premised on the value of IP, with the goal of investing our capital in operating companies that can generate solid, stable income streams. Due to high valuations that we attribute to inexpensive and widely available capital, we did not acquire any such operating companies in 2015, 2016 or 2017. We may encounter more suitable opportunities if the cost of capital increases over time. We intend to continue to explore new business opportunities that are better suited for non-listed private companies while keeping our costs contained. 
 Although our focus has evolved away from companies that develop or possess unique, innovative technologies, we will continue to dedicate effort and resources to generate revenue from our existing IP assets.

Competition 
 Due to the unique nature of our IP rights, we do not compete directly with other patent holders or patent applicants. However, to the extent that multiple parties seek royalties on the same product or service, we might as a practical matter compete for a share of reasonable royalties from manufacturers and distributors.
 As we pursue opportunities that are not premised on the value of IP, we may compete with well-capitalized companies pursuing those same opportunities.
 Divestiture of Satellite Assets 
 When we were formed in 2000, our intent was to develop and operate a next generation global mobile satellite communications system.  In 2011, we started selling assets associated with the satellite business and, during 2012, we divested the remaining vestiges of our satellite business, including the sale of our remaining medium earth orbit (“MEO”) satellites and related equipment and our real property in Brazil, the transfer to a liquidating trust (the “Liquidating Trust”) of certain former subsidiaries associated with the satellite business (the “International Subsidiaries”) to address the winding down of the International Subsidiaries, and the settlement of our litigation with The Boeing Company (“Boeing”).   
 The 2012 divestiture and the corresponding transfer to the Liquidating Trust of the International Subsidiaries triggered tax losses of approximately $2.4 billion, which we believe can be carried forward for up to twenty years.  Under the sales agreement for the MEO assets, the Company is entitled to a substantial portion of any proceeds generated from the resale of the MEO assets. In January 2015, the party that acquired the MEO assets from the Company resold the MEO assets and as a result, the Company received $3.9 million during 2015, which has been recorded in gain on contingencies in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. On February 23, 2016, that party received the final scheduled payment for the MEO assets, which resulted in the Company’s recognition of an additional $2.0 million gain on contingency in 2016. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, on a consolidated basis, we had the equivalent of 12 full-time employees located in Washington, California, Finland and Texas.
