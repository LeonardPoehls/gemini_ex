Item 1. Business
Business Overview

J. C. Penney Company, Inc. is a holding company whose principal operating subsidiary is J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. (JCP). JCP was incorporated in Delaware in 1924, and J. C. Penney Company, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2002, when the holding company structure was implemented. The new holding company assumed the name J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (Company). The holding company has no independent assets or operations, and no direct subsidiaries other than JCP. Common stock of the Company is publicly traded under the symbol “JCP” on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company is a co-obligor (or guarantor, as appropriate) regarding the payment of principal and interest on JCP’s outstanding debt securities. The guarantee by the Company of certain of JCP’s outstanding debt securities is full and unconditional. The holding company and its consolidated subsidiaries, including JCP, are collectively referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “we,” “us,” “our,” “ourselves,” “Company” or “JCPenney.”

Since our founding by James Cash Penney in 1902, we have grown to be a major retailer, operating 1,013 department stores in 49 states and Puerto Rico as of January 28, 2017. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years, rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2016 ended on January 28, 2017; fiscal year 2015 ended on January 30, 2016; and fiscal year 2014 ended on January 31, 2015. Each consisted of 52 weeks.

Our business consists of selling merchandise and services to consumers through our department stores and our website at jcpenney.com, which utilizes fully optimized applications for desktop, mobile and tablet devices. Our department stores and website generally serve the same type of customers, our website offers virtually the same mix of merchandise as our store assortment plus other extended categories that are not offered in store, and our department stores generally accept returns from sales made in stores and via our website. We fulfill online customer purchases by direct shipment to the customer from our distribution facilities and stores or from our suppliers' warehouses and by in store customer pick up. We sell family apparel and footwear, accessories, fine and fashion jewelry, beauty products through Sephora inside JCPenney, home furnishings and large appliances. In addition, our department stores provide our customers with services such as styling salon, optical, portrait photography and custom decorating. 

Based on how we categorized our divisions in 2016, our merchandise mix of total net sales over the last three years was as follows: 

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Women’s apparel | 24 | % | | 25 | % | 26 | %

Operating Strategy
We have developed a strategic framework that focuses on the following three pillars:
•Private brands;
•Omnichannel; and
•Revenue per customer.
We believe these three pillars provide the foundation to increase loyalty with our customers and enable the organization to simplify its focus by ensuring that resources and capital investments are effectively allocated to drive these priorities. 
3

Our first priority is private brands. To differentiate us with the consumer, we plan to leverage our sourcing and private brand infrastructure to increase our production of private brands with style, quality and value. With an established global network of sourcing offices, along with a team of in-house designers, we plan to grow private brand penetration to enhance our profitability.
Our second priority is to become a world-class omnichannel retailer. We have a rich heritage of being a catalog retailer and have much of our omnichannel infrastructure already in place. We are digitally connected with our customers via a mobile app and the Internet and have three large, strategically located dot-com distribution centers with approximately five million square feet of space for providing expanded assortment and order fulfillment. Additionally, our objective is to create a seamless connection between our digital and brick-and-mortar operations through initiatives such as a mobile app that is designed to be deeply integrated with the store experience and buy-online-pick-up-in-store same day (BOPIS).

Our final strategic priority is increasing revenue per customer. Within our new brand platform of "Get Your Penney's Worth," it is our mission to help our customer find what she loves for less time, money and effort. To accomplish this mission, we see an increased opportunity to grow shopping frequency and the amount that customers spend on every transaction. We plan to address this opportunity by enhancing our cross-merchandising appeal with initiatives to upgrade each store’s center core, to add appliances and other home categories to our merchandise assortment, and to continue the rollout of our Sephora inside JCPenney locations.
Competition and Seasonality

The business of selling merchandise and services is highly competitive. We are one of the largest department store and e-commerce retailers in the United States, and we have numerous competitors, as further described in Item 1A, Risk Factors. Many factors enter into the competition for the consumer’s patronage, including merchandise assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation, credit availability, customer loyalty and availability of in-store services such as styling salon, optical, portrait photography and custom decorating. Our annual earnings depend to a great extent on the results of operations for the last quarter of the fiscal year, which includes the holiday season, when a significant portion of our sales and profits are recorded.

Website Availability

We maintain an Internet website at www.jcpenney.com and make available free of charge through this website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all related amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after the materials are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Suppliers

We have a diversified supplier base, both domestic and foreign, and are not dependent to any significant degree on any single supplier. We purchase our merchandise from approximately 2,600 domestic and foreign suppliers, many of whom have done business with us for many years. In addition to our Plano, Texas home office, we, through our purchasing subsidiary, maintained buying and quality assurance offices in 10 foreign countries as of January 28, 2017.

Employment

The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 106,000 full-time and part-time employees as of January 28, 2017.

Environmental Matters

Environmental protection requirements did not have a material effect upon our operations during 2016. It is possible that compliance with such requirements (including any new requirements) would lengthen lead time in expansion or renovation plans and increase construction costs, and therefore operating costs, due in part to the expense and time required to conduct environmental and ecological studies and any required remediation.

As of January 28, 2017, we estimated our total potential environmental liabilities to range from $20 million to $26 million and recorded our best estimate of $24 million in Other accounts payable and accrued expenses and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date. This estimate covered potential liabilities primarily related to underground storage tanks, remediation of environmental conditions involving our former drugstore locations and asbestos removal in connection with approved plans to renovate or dispose of our facilities. We continue to assess required remediation and the adequacy of environmental reserves as new information becomes available and known conditions are further delineated. If we were to incur losses at the upper end of the estimated range, we do not believe that such losses would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
