ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Overview
CDTi Advanced Materials, Inc. is a leading provider of technology and solutions to the automotive emissions control markets. We possess market leading expertise in emissions catalyst design and engineering for automotive and off-road applications. In particular, we have a proven ability to develop proprietary materials incorporating various base metals that replace costly platinum group metals ("PGM") and rare earth metals in coatings on vehicle catalytic converters. Our business is driven by increasingly stringent global emission standards for internal combustion engines, which are major sources of a variety of harmful pollutants.
We deliver our catalyst technology through the supply of materials and technology used in the catalyst coating process as well as finished products such as coated substrates and emission control systems. We supply our proprietary catalyst technologies to major automakers, heavy duty truck manufacturers, catalyst manufacturers, distributors, integrators and retrofitters. 
We produce coated substrates at our ISO certified manufacturing facility in Oxnard, California. In some instances, the coated substrates we produce are integrated into exhaust systems by third-party manufacturers before being shipped to our end customer. We also supply coated substrates directly to exhaust systems manufacturers for incorporation in their own products.
Over the past decade, we have developed and produced several generations of high performance catalysts for automotive and off-road applications. Over the last two years we have developed the ability to deliver our catalyst technology to other catalyst manufacturers in the form of functional powders or material systems. Most catalytic systems require significant amounts of costly PGMs to operate effectively. Our material systems, featuring inexpensive base-metals with low PGM content deliver like or better performance than competing higher-PGM catalysts.
The ability to supply our technology to other market participants has vastly expanded the addressable market for our products and allowed us to redeploy resources that were previously invested in capital intensive catalyst manufacturing activities. During 2017 we completed manufacturing commitments to Honda for production catalysts and sold our Durafit product line. These initiatives completed our repositioning as a supplier of materials and technology to the global catalyst market. 
Strategy
Over more than twenty years, we have developed the emissions control technology and manufacturing know-how that allows us to deliver enabling technology to catalyst manufacturers globally. In support of this strategy, we have filed approximately 228 patents that underpin next-generation technology for our advanced zero-PGM or ZPGM and low-PGM catalysts. The ability to supply our advanced materials to other catalyst producers as functional powders allows us to achieve greater scale and higher return on our technology investment than would be possible solely as a manufacturer. 
The strategy to provide our technology to other manufacturers has significantly increased the size of our addressable market and provides access to markets that would not be achievable as a catalyst producer. In the short term, we are focusing our efforts and resources by pursuing opportunities in fast growing OEM automotive markets in China and India, as well as in selected segments of the European and North American aftermarket.
China remains the world’s single largest automotive market with more than 29 million vehicles sold in 2017 and offers significant opportunity for CDTi products. There is an extensive emission control systems supply chain serving domestic and international automobile manufacturers in China. Somewhat unique to China, there are many domestic catalyst manufacturers serving the automotive market in competition with the large global catalyst producers. This segment of the market requires technology and know-how to adhere to increasingly stringent emissions standards and to deliver competitively priced catalysts. In addition, there is significant pressure for the Chinese automotive market to address increasing air pollution, an issue that has escalated to become a matter of public policy. We believe these factors provide a highly favorable environment for our products and technology.
Air quality is also an important market driver in India where annual vehicle production was over 4.4 million in 2017 with an additional 21 million two and three wheel vehicles also produced. India has a number of domestic vehicle manufacturers that are served by both global and local catalyst manufacturers. There is significant opportunity to provide enabling technology to local catalyst producers with the appropriate manufacturing expertise.
We have focused our resources in North America and Europe on providing our materials and technology to catalyst manufacturers serving the automotive aftermarket.
Evolving Global Emissions Standards
1

For heavy-duty diesel, China, India and Europe are all working towards achieving Eu-6 based emissions standards by 2020. China 6, Euro-6 and BS6 require very low PM, PN, CO, HC and NOx. The system and catalyst implications are now well understood and in all three markets the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst, Catalyzed Diesel Filter and SCR catalysts are the key catalyst components to enable compliance. Test cycles, such as WHTC, are becoming more real-world focused with the introduction of the Worldwide Harmonized Test Cycle.
In the US the future regulations for heavy-duty vehicles are focused on Greenhouse Gas Standards for 2021, with Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, regulations in place, and the California Air Resources Board, or CARB, close to finalizing their requirements. Air Districts are publicly petitioning the EPA to create an Ultra Low NOx standard.
For light-duty passenger cars, China, India and Europe are all working towards achieving Eu-6 based emissions standards by 2020 but with some variations between the markets. China has a 6b category which is more stringent than any European standard and may be implemented early in some regions of China. The Eu-6 basis will require improved conversion efficiency and some level of adoption of particulate filters to meet the required particle number. The test cycles used to validate Euro 6c compliance are also becoming more real world focused, eventually moving to Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) transient cycle. 
In the US the EPA and CARB standards are converging for passenger cars, with the most stringent standard, Tier3 bin 30, phased in by 2023. Tier 3 represents a very significant tightening of tailpipe emissions over the current standard. The current US administration is reviewing the Tier 3 regulation plan and timing.
China and India, the world’s two largest two-wheel markets, have transitioned from carburated systems to closed loop, fuel injected systems containing three-way catalysts.
Technology
We have succeeded in developing a broad technology portfolio of new materials and catalysts that allow for a significant reduction in the use of PGM, and as a result, cost.

• | Our Spinel™ technology is a unique clean emissions exhaust technology which we believe will dramatically reduce the cost of attaining more stringent clean air standards. Spinel was the name initially given to naturally-occurring magnesium aluminate (MgAI2O4) and is now used to describe any composition with the same structure. Our Spinel™ technology can employ numerous low-cost metals in the spinel structure enabling use in a wide range of engine and vehicle applications, both gasoline and diesel, as well as other potential vertical markets. Our unique Spinel™ technology utilizes various base metals, which when combined together in a common structure, achieve unusual and very effective catalytic conversion activity. Spinel™ technology is ideal for the coating of catalytic converters, an alternative to those utilizing costly PGMs and rare earth materials. The base metals we use are common and inexpensive compared to PGMs, such as platinum, palladium and rhodium, and rare earth metals, such as cerium, lanthanum and neodymium. We believe Spinel™ technology will provide significant cost savings over conventional coating formulations. In addition, the Spinel™ technology structure is extremely versatile and stable. The versatility is critical for optimizing future generations of products to meet changing catalytic conversion needs for rapidly evolving engine technologies and increasingly stringent clean air standards. The stability of Spinel™ is critical to provide superior catalytic performance over time and at extreme temperatures for lifetime durability. In addition to SPGM™ and ZPGM™ catalysts, we currently have oxygen storage material, or OSM, under development, which synergizes PGM function and enables functionality of the critical vehicle on-board diagnostic system.


• | We have developed powder materials that can be used to produce SPGM™DOC, synergized PGM diesel oxidation catalyst. The unique materials developed enable a low PGM and high performance DOC for use in a range of applications, including systems utilizing particulate filters and SCR for advanced emission standards.

We protect our proprietary technologies, along with our other intellectual property, through the use of patents, trade secrets and registered and common law trademarks. For additional information, refer to the "Intellectual Property" discussion below.
Competitive Advantages
Through a focused technology development campaign, we have developed a full suite of materials for gasoline and diesel engines. We believe that our technologies and products represent a fundamentally different solution, and the following competitive strengths position us as a leading provider of emission control products and systems.

• | Superior Catalyst Performance. Our proprietary technology enables us to produce catalytic coatings capable of significantly better catalytic performance than those previously available. We have achieved this demonstrated performance advantage by creating catalysts using unique nanostructures with superior stability under prolonged exposure to high temperatures. As a result, in heavy duty diesel and automotive applications, our catalyst formulations

are able to maintain high levels of performance over time using substantially lower, or zero, PGMs than products previously available.

• | Catalyst Cost Advantage—Addressing Global PGM Supply and Demand. Expensive PGMs, which include palladium, platinum and rhodium, and rare earth metals such as cerium, neodymium and lanthanum, are used in the manufacture of emission control catalysts, with palladium being the primary component used in catalysts serving the global light duty vehicle market. According to Johnson Matthey PLC's "Platinum 2013 Interim Review", in 2013, over 70% of all primary platinum and 80% of all primary rhodium produced originated in South Africa. Russia and South Africa combined supplied over 75% of palladium. We believe that the continued growth in supply of these metals from the mines in South Africa and Russia will be critical in order to meet the increasingly stringent global emission control standards. According to the same report, it is estimated that more than $6 billion is spent annually by OEMs on PGM purchases for catalysts. The global auto industry is expected to produce over 100 million vehicles by 2018, according to IHS Automotive. These production levels are expected to result in a continued increase in PGM demand for the foreseeable future. In addition, continued tightening of emission standards by regulators globally will require increased loading of PGM in emission catalysts. The new materials developed at CDTI enable OEMs and their suppliers to drastically reduce the PGM loadings in the DOC and TWC products that currently require the high cost of elevated PGM usage. 


• | Highly Customizable Catalyst Formulations. We have developed our technology since inception as a platform that can be tailored for a range of different catalyst applications. Specifically, our formulations can be tailored in two distinct ways. First, the oxide compounds used in our formulations can be adapted for specific applications by adding a wide range of chemical elements to them. Second, we are able to vary the mixtures of our compounds to create customized solutions for specific applications for different vehicle platforms within the auto industry, complex heavy duty diesel equipment for OEMs, aftermarket and retrofit markets, and for different applications in the energy sector, such as selective catalytic reduction nitrogen oxide control for industrial and utility boilers, process heaters, gas turbines and generator sets. These could also include applications in the fuel cell, petrochemical and refinery, and thermoelectric industries. 


• | Compatibility with Existing Manufacturing Infrastructure and Operating Specifications. Catalytic converters using our catalyst technologies are compatible with existing automotive manufacturing processes as well as specific vehicle operating specifications. Our customers generally do not need to change their manufacturing operations, processes, or how their products operate in order to utilize our proprietary technology. 

Sales and Marketing
In the OEM segment, we utilize a business development team, with technical backgrounds, to pursue customers that can benefit from the use of our technology in the manufacture of their own catalysts. Extensive interaction is required between catalyst manufacturers and the auto-maker in the course of developing an effective, reliable catalyst for a particular application. We produce coated catalysts and continue to be an approved supplier of catalysts for major automotive manufacturers. Our ability to deliver our technology in powder form to catalyst manufacturers has enhanced our ability to market our products globally and to other catalyst manufacturers.
In the automotive aftermarket segment, our commercial efforts are concentrated on providing materials and technology to catalyst manufacturers in North America and Europe. We also serve niche markets including mining, oil and gas, and materials handling, as well as retrofit projects.
Competition
We believe our market position as a supplier of enabling materials and technology to catalyst manufacturers is unique. Where we supply coated catalysts and emission control systems, we compete against BASF GmbH, Johnson Matthey PLC, Umicore N.V., Donaldson Company, Inc., ESW, Inc., Hug Filtersystems, and DCL International, Inc. among others.
In the worldwide market, the key competitive factors are:

• | Ability to provide a solution that satisfies emission reduction regulations;


• | Total cost of product (inclusive of PGM);


• | Ability to transition new products from development to production;


• | Quality control that guarantees 100% compliance with specifications; and


• | On-time delivery to support customer production requirements

We coat our proprietary catalyst products at our Oxnard, California manufacturing facility as well as support our downstream partners in deploying coating processes in their global facilities to enable them to correctly apply our unique products.
We maintain ISO 9001:2008, ISO/TS 16949:2009 and ISO 14001:2004 certifications for our facilities.
The availability of raw materials is generally dictated by global market supply of key materials. Delivery of key materials such as rare earth metals and PGMs have been at times constricted due to global supply constraints. Changing suppliers for some raw materials may require regulatory or customer approval. For further discussion of risk of supply, refer to "Item 1.A. Risk Factors”.
Regulations
We are committed to complying with all federal, state and international environmental laws governing production, use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our emissions control products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with emissions standards applicable to new product diesel, gasoline and alternative fuel engines. These regulations include those developed in Japan, in the United States by the EPA and CARB and in the E.U. by the European Environment Agency, including standards from the Verification of Emission Reduction Technologies, or VERT, Association.
In the United States, regulatory approval is obtained from the EPA or CARB through a verification process. The verification process includes a thorough review of the technology as well as tightly controlled testing to quantify statistically significant levels of emission reductions. 
Company History
We are a Delaware corporation formed in 1994 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fuel Tech, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as Fuel-Tech N.V., a Netherlands Antilles limited liability company) ("Fuel Tech"), and were spun off by Fuel Tech in a rights offering in December 1995 on the NASDAQ Stock Market (Symbol CDTI). On October 15, 2010, we completed a business combination with Catalytic Solutions, Inc. ("CSI"), a California corporation formed in 1996, when our wholly-owned subsidiary, CDTI Merger Sub, Inc., merged with and into CSI. We refer to this transaction as the "Merger." The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and, as a result, our Company's (the legal acquirer) consolidated financial statements are now those of CSI (the accounting acquirer), with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of CDTI being included effective from October 15, 2010, the closing date of the Merger. From November 22, 2006 through the closing date of
