We are an owner and operator of regional casino and entertainment properties located in the United States and one hotel, timeshare and casino resort property located on the island of Aruba.

("Icahn Enterprises"), our majority shareholder. Our United States properties include two casinos in Nevada and one casino in each of Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and New Jersey. We primarily cater to local and regional guests to provide a fun and exciting gaming environment with high quality and high value lodging, dining, retail and entertainment amenities. Our properties offer a broad array of gaming options specifically tailored for our patrons in each market.

Our Strengths
Focus on Regional Gaming Markets in Favorable Jurisdictions. Our properties primarily serve local and regional markets. We believe that regional gaming markets have been less volatile than destination gaming markets, which rely on air travel for their patronage. Our properties are primarily located in significant drive-in gaming markets, which allows our casino patrons to reach us in short travel times and make repeated trips to our gaming facilities. In order to meet the specific needs of local and regional customers, we tailor our gaming and entertainment experience to offer our customers a high quality product at a compelling price point.
Diversity in Geography and Product Offerings.    We operate land-based gaming facilities and one dockside gaming facility in several of the largest commercial gaming markets in the United States. In addition, we currently operate a small casino at our resort property on the Caribbean island of Aruba. Because our facilities are geographically diversified, we are not subject to reliance on any single gaming market, which we believe mitigates the impact of potential market cycles. The majority of our gaming facilities offer multi-denominational, state-of-the-art slot machines as well as a full range of table games and betting minimums and limits, catering to a wide range of potential customers. We also offer internet gaming to our customers located within New Jersey. Our casino properties include hotel rooms, which both diversifies our revenue base and helps 
 4

extend the average length of our patrons' stays at our facilities. We also offer timeshare intervals for sale at our Aruba property. Additionally, our customers enjoy a strong breadth of product offerings at our facilities, including restaurants, nightclubs, bars, retail stores and entertainment venues, which further diversifies our sources of revenue and offers our customers attractive non-gaming entertainment options.
The Company, through our wholly-owned subsidiary TEI Management Services LLC, also provided management services to the Taj Mahal through its sale in March 2017 and provides services to the closed Plaza Hotel in Atlantic City. In addition, the Company, through our wholly-owned subsidiary TropWorld Games LLC, operates an online social gaming website.
Emphasis on Slot Play.    We emphasize slot machine wagering, which we believe is typically both the highest margin and most predictable component of the gaming industry. Slot machines do not have the staffing requirements of table games nor do they have the variation in hold percentages that characterize the table game component of the casino business. We believe this affords us a more stable and predictable revenue base, as well as the potential for more consistent margins.
Committed Sponsorship.  Icahn Enterprises, the beneficial owner of approximately 83.9% of our common stock, has demonstrated a history of successfully acquiring assets and improving and enhancing such assets' operations. Its investment record is based on a long-term investment horizon that enhances business value. Our management continues to work closely with Icahn Enterprises to identify immediate and long-term strategic and operational improvements.
Our Strategies
Offer A Fun and Exciting Experience at Good Value.    We believe our facilities provide our guests with an attractive price-to-value relationship by offering an exciting gaming atmosphere in attractive surroundings. We seek to apply this positioning across our gaming and related amenities while maintaining attentive and friendly guest service. We also emphasize professional and courteous attitudes consistent with our high hospitality standards. By communicating our value proposition to customers through our marketing programs and their experiences at our properties, we believe we distinguish ourselves from our competition.
Leverage Brand Awareness and Customer Loyalty.    Tropicana is a longstanding and recognizable brand in the gaming industry. We continuously strive to identify marketing and promotion innovations that strengthen brand awareness and improve customer flow. Trop Advantage, our player loyalty card program, offers customers discounts and other benefits across our properties. We also utilize strategically targeted direct mail and social media marketing programs to enhance brand loyalty with current customers and attract new patrons to our properties.
Continue Execution of Operational Improvements and Cost Saving Opportunities.    We have implemented a number of capital investment programs and operational "best practices" aimed at growing revenue, improving margins at our properties, and reducing overhead expenses. Our analytical approach to operating our properties and in-depth research of gaming operations have allowed us to identify further cost saving opportunities across our portfolio of assets. Most of these savings do not impact customer service but rather involve a more efficient use of resources. These changes include development of a database and campaign manager system, centralizing purchasing to reduce costs, consolidating and streamlining back office operations, including utilizing third parties for certain services and reconfiguring gaming floor layouts and optimizing table game rules to increase hold and win. 
Pursue Appropriate Expansion Opportunities.    Our primary focus has been the stabilization and growth of revenues in competitive gaming markets, implementation of operational improvements, the renovation of our existing properties and development of new strategic business initiatives. We also consider expansion opportunities in new gaming jurisdictions and underserved markets and acquisition opportunities and other strategic transactions that may arise periodically. For example, in 2014 we acquired Lumière Place Casino and Hotels in St. Louis Missouri ("Lumière Place"), in 2015 we launched a social gaming website, TropWorld.com, utilizing a social gaming platform developed and operated by a third party and in 2017 we acquired the property formerly known as The Chelsea Hotel in Atlantic City, which is located adjacent to Tropicana AC.
Properties and Segments
The Company views each casino property as an operating segment which is aggregated by region in order to present our reportable segments: (i) East, (ii) Central, (iii) West and (iv) South. The operating results of all other subsidiaries of the Company, such as TEI Management Services LLC and TropWorld Games LLC, are reported under the heading of "Corporate and other," as they have been determined to not meet the aggregation criteria of separately reportable segments. The following describes each of our properties by region.

In 2015, we completed an approximate $35 million renovation project, which included remodeling the North hotel tower guest rooms, renovation of the casino, restaurant renovations, a new health club operated by a third party operator, new retail outlets and exterior renovations including painting and new lighting. The 2015 renovations also included a multimedia light and sound show on the boardwalk. Since November 2013, Tropicana AC has been operating continuous, 24-hour Internet gaming on its online gaming site, www.TropicanaCasino.com. Tropicana Atlantic City Online showcases a variety of slot game options and classic casino table games. Players have the opportunity to participate in community jackpots and to be rewarded with both on-property and online incentives and have the chance to participate in a variety of promotions. All participants must be 21 or older and physically located in New Jersey to play.
Central
Tropicana Evansville 
Tropicana Evansville ("Tropicana Evansville") is a large casino hotel and entertainment complex, and a popular attraction in Evansville, the third largest city in the state of Indiana. The property serves customers in the tri-state region of southern Indiana, southeastern Illinois and western Kentucky and is the only full service casino within an 85-mile radius. Approximately 57% of Tropicana Evansville's revenues come from customers within a 50-mile radius. The property's casino operations, which were previously located dockside on the three-deck "City of Evansville" riverboat, were relocated to the landside gaming facility in October 2017 upon completion of the construction of the new facility. The new landside facility, which is located across the street from the original riverboat casino, is anchored on each end by Tropicana's two hotels and encompasses approximately 79,000 square feet of enclosed space, including approximately 45,000 square feet of casino floor, two new food and beverage outlets, an entertainment lounge and back of house space, and was built at a total cost of approximately $50 million. 
Tropicana Evansville has two distinctive hotels: the Tropicana Evansville Hotel, a 243-room hotel which offers guests a restaurant, conference rooms and banquet facilities; and Le Merigot Hotel, a luxurious 95-room boutique hotel. 
A 44,000-square-foot pavilion connected to each hotel via pedestrian bridges features a fine dining restaurant and a gift shop. Prior to the relocation of the casino to the landside operation in October 2017, the pavilion also had a coffee shop, two casual dining restaurants, an entertainment lounge and a players' club. 
The District at Tropicana Evansville, a $33 million entertainment complex that opened in late 2006, currently includes a restaurant, the Le Merigot Hotel and banquet/event space, along with an additional parking lot for our Le Merigot Hotel guests. Tropicana Evansville also has a seven-story parking garage as well as surface parking.

Lumière Place Casino
Lumière Place is located on approximately 20 acres, located in historic downtown St. Louis, Missouri near business and entertainment districts and overlooks the Mississippi River. Its location provides significant foot traffic from nearby venues, including The Dome at America's Center, a multi-purpose stadium and convention center, which are connected to Lumière Place via a pedestrian tunnel, the Gateway Arch and Busch Stadium. In addition to the casino, the Lumière Place complex includes the 294 all-suites HoteLumière, the 200-room luxury Four Seasons Hotel St. Louis, 3 full service restaurants, retail shops, indoor pool and fitness center, full service spa and 28,000 square feet of meeting and convention space. The suites in HoteLumière were completely renovated in a project which commenced in July 2016 and was completed in early 2017, at a cost of approximately $15 million.
West
Tropicana Laughlin
Tropicana Laughlin Hotel and Casino ("Tropicana Laughlin") is located on an approximately 31-acre site on Casino Drive, Laughlin, Nevada's principal thoroughfare. In addition, we own approximately 57 acres of undeveloped real estate immediately adjacent to Tropicana Laughlin. The property attracts customers who drive in from southern California and Arizona. Tropicana Laughlin primarily targets customers in this market who are seeking great value, a breadth of amenities and friendly service in their gaming, lodging, dining and entertainment experiences. Non-gaming amenities include 1,487 hotel rooms, a heated outdoor swimming pool, seven restaurants, three full service bars, an entertainment lounge with live music, a premium lounge for high-end players, an 800-seat multi-purpose showroom and concert hall, meeting and convention space, retail stores, an arcade and a covered parking structure. In 2017, we completed a renovation of 496 hotel rooms at Tropicana Laughlin, at a total cost of approximately $4.7 million.
MontBleu
MontBleu Casino Resort & Spa ("MontBleu") is situated on approximately 21 acres in South Lake Tahoe, Nevada surrounded by the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The property attracts both drive-in and destination patrons, primarily from the northern California and northern Nevada markets. The area also attracts people seeking outdoor recreational activities. In addition to the casino, the property offers guests 438 hotel rooms, a choice of three restaurants and various non-gaming amenities, including retail shops, two nightclubs, a 1,300-seat showroom, approximately 14,000 square feet of meeting and convention space, a parking garage, a full service health spa and workout area, an indoor heated lagoon-style pool with whirlpool and a 110-seat wedding chapel. An approximately $25 million property renovation project was completed in December 2015, which included remodeling of the guest rooms and most of the public areas of the property including the casino, lobby, theater, convention center, sports bar and sports book and exterior of the building.
South
Trop Greenville
Trop Casino Greenville ("Trop Greenville"), located in Greenville, Mississippi is a landside gaming facility with slot machines and table games in a 22,800 square foot casino, two restaurants, a bar and 734 onsite parking spaces. The property also leases and operates the Greenville Inn & Suites, a 40-room hotel, containing 22 standard rooms and 18 suites, located less than a mile from the casino, and offers free shuttle service to and from Trop Greenville. In 2017, a renovation project, which included renovation of hotel rooms as well as construction of a non-smoking slot room and a gift shop, was completed at a cost of approximately $1.4 million.
 Trop Greenville, along with another land-based casino, are currently the only gaming facilities in the Greenville market. The property draws customers primarily from the local market and to some extent from the Little Rock, Vicksburg and Tunica markets.
Belle of Baton Rouge
Belle of Baton Rouge Casino & Hotel ("Belle of Baton Rouge") is a dockside riverboat situated on approximately 23 acres on the Mississippi River in the downtown historic district of Baton Rouge, across from the River Center, a 70,000-square-foot convention center. The three-deck, dockside riverboat casino is one of three casino facilities in the Baton Rouge market. Baton Rouge is located 75 miles north of New Orleans and is the largest city in Louisiana. Over 90% of the Belle of Baton Rouge customer base resides within a 50-mile radius of the property. Non-gaming amenities include 288 hotel rooms, 25,000 square feet of meeting space, an outdoor pool, a fitness center, one restaurant, a deli, a buffet, an entertainment venue 
 7

In 2016 the Company completed a $5 million renovation project, consisting of 74 fully remodeled rooms that are used as timeshare units, including a model room, a sales center and a new access road to the property improving our guest arrival process. In 2017, an additional 16 rooms were renovated in a project that included exterior building refreshes. The Company plans to renovate an additional 98 rooms in 2018 at an estimated cost of $9 million. The newly renovated rooms are also utilized as hotel rooms when not occupied as a timeshare interval. The Company began selling timeshare intervals at the property in late 2015.
Our Equity Owners
As of December 31, 2017, Icahn Enterprises was the beneficial owner of approximately 83.9% of the Company's Common Stock. Icahn Enterprises is a diversified holding company that owns subsidiaries engaged in a variety of businesses including investment management, automotive, gaming, metals, real estate, home fashion, railcar, energy and food packaging. Icahn Enterprises is publicly listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (ticker: "IEP"). Carl C. Icahn, who is the chairman of our board of directors, is also the chairman of the board of directors of the general partner of Icahn Enterprises.
Our Corporate History and Information
We are a Delaware corporation that was formed on May 11, 2009 to acquire certain assets of Tropicana Entertainment Holdings, LLC ("TEH") and certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to their plan of reorganization (the "Plan") under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"). We also acquired Columbia Properties Vicksburg, LLC ("CP Vicksburg") which we later sold in March 2011, JMBS Casino, LLC ("JMBS Casino") and CP Laughlin Realty, LLC ("CP Laughlin Realty", and together with TEH and certain of its subsidiaries, CP Vicksburg and JMBS Casino, the "Predecessors"), pursuant to the Plan. In addition, we acquired certain assets of Adamar of New Jersey, Inc. ("Adamar"), an unconsolidated subsidiary of TEH, including Tropicana AC.
On May 5, 2008, the Predecessors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Chapter 11 Cases") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court"). The reorganization of the Predecessors and the acquisition of Tropicana AC (together, the "Restructuring Transactions") were consummated and became effective on March 8, 2010 (the "Effective Date"), at which time we acquired Tropicana AC and several of the Predecessors' gaming properties and related assets. Prior to the Effective Date, we conducted no business, other than in connection with the Restructuring Transactions, and had no material assets or liabilities.
Our executive offices are located at 8345 W. Sunset Road, Suite 300, Las Vegas, Nevada 89113. Our telephone number is (702) 589-3900 and our website is www.tropicanacasinos.com.
Competition
We own land-based and riverboat casino facilities in six states and one casino resort located on the island of Aruba. We compete with numerous casinos and casino hotels of varying quality and size in the markets in which our properties are located and with other forms of legalized gaming, including internet gaming, state-sponsored lotteries, racetracks, off-track wagering, video lottery, video poker terminals and card parlors. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, and with various other entertainment businesses. The casino entertainment business includes competitors that vary considerably by their size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, level of amenities, management talent and geographic diversity.
In most markets, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas, including casinos located on Native American reservations. In some markets, we face competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within our market areas.
We believe competition in existing markets has intensified over the last several years, due to new markets opening for development, new properties opening in existing markets, and challenging economic conditions in certain markets. Many casino operators have invested in expanding existing facilities, developing new facilities, and acquiring established facilities in existing markets. The expansion of casino entertainment at existing properties, the increase in the number of properties and the 
 8

aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors has increased competition in many markets in which we compete, and we expect this intense competition to continue. 
Our operating results can be adversely affected by costs associated with advertising, promotions and complimentary services to patrons, the amount and timing of which may be affected by the advertising and complimentary policies and actions of our properties' competitors and our efforts to keep pace with them. If our operating revenues are insufficient to allow us to match the promotions of competitors, the number of our casino patrons may decline, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. In addition, some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do, and as a result we may not be able to successfully compete with them in the future.
Our ability to compete successfully depends upon our ability to manage our costs and develop and implement strong and effective marketing campaigns both at our individual properties and across our business, as well as our investment in, and upgrade to, the facilities we own. To the extent we are unable to develop and implement these types of marketing initiatives and invest in and upgrade our facilities, we may not be successful in competing in our markets, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
The competitive environment of each of our properties is described below by region.
East
Tropicana AC
The Atlantic City market primarily serves the New York-Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington, D.C. corridor with nearly 48 million adults living within a 300-mile radius. Tropicana AC offers slot machines, table games and intrastate internet gaming and primarily competes with casino and gaming facilities located in Atlantic City and the northeast region of the country. The following is a brief summary of competition in these markets.
Atlantic City.   Between January 2014 and October 2016, five Atlantic City casino hotels closed as a result of regional competitive market pressures and other factors. As a result of these closures, the Atlantic City gaming market experienced significant revenue declines during this period. Atlantic City gaming revenues have recently stabilized and Tropicana AC has increased market share, in part, due to the closings. However, the Atlantic City operating climate remains difficult. In 2017, Hard Rock International acquired the former Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, which is currently being renovated for an anticipated opening as a casino hotel in the summer of 2018. In addition, the former Revel casino was recently purchased and its new owners have announced intentions to reopen the property in the summer of 2018 as a casino hotel. The reopening of these two casino hotel properties will add to the already competitive market in Atlantic City and may negatively impact Tropicana AC's market share.
Currently, casino hotels located in Atlantic City, including Tropicana AC, compete with each other on the basis of customer service, quality and extent of amenities and promotional offers. For this reason, Tropicana AC and its competitors have historically incurred substantial capital expenditures and marketing expenses to compete effectively. The increased competition from neighboring jurisdictions, particularly Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware and Maryland (as discussed in more detail below), has further intensified the competition among the casino hotels currently operating in Atlantic City.
New Jersey law also permits a limited number of "boutique casinos" to be developed in Atlantic City. These boutique casinos would be subject to less stringent size and costs structures than those to which Tropicana AC and other existing casinos are currently subject, but would be subject to a higher gross gaming tax than non-boutique Atlantic City casinos. To date, no such “boutique casinos” have been developed, but if such are developed in the future, Tropicana AC could face additional competition.
In addition, various legislative initiatives have been introduced to authorize casino gaming at various locations in New Jersey. Most recently, a referendum in November 2016 to authorize up to two casinos in northern New Jersey was rejected by voters. Notwithstanding the rejection of this referendum by the voters, various legislative initiatives continue to be introduced in the New Jersey legislature to expand gaming at New Jersey racetracks. Should New Jersey authorize the expansion of gaming outside of Atlantic City in the future, Atlantic City casinos, including Tropicana AC, could lose customers and significant business.
Pennsylvania.    Atlantic City casinos, including Tropicana AC, primarily compete against the Pennsylvania gaming facilities located in the eastern part of the state that offer slot machines, table games and a variety of non-gaming amenities. These include four Philadelphia metropolitan area casinos and three casinos located north of the Philadelphia metropolitan area. In addition, in 2014 following a competitive bidding process, a second Philadelphia Category 2 casino license was awarded to 
 9

Live! Hotel & Casino who have announced plans to construct a $400 million 200,000 square foot casino project in south Philadelphia to include 2,000 slot machines, 125 table games, a 240 room hotel and 2,500 parking spaces. Should such casino be constructed it will further impact Atlantic City gaming revenues. In addition, in 2017, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted legislation to expand various forms of gaming throughout the state including: (i) the licensing of up to ten new Category 4 casinos with up to 750 slot machines and 30 table games at each casino; (ii) the licensing of video gaming terminals ("VGT's") at truck stops in authorized locations throughout the state with up to five VGT's at each location; (iii) the authorization of internet gaming at existing casinos; (iv) the expansion of the number of slot machines and table games at Category 3 casinos and elimination of the admission fee at those casinos; (v) the authorization of gaming on mobile devices at select Pennsylvania airports; and (vi) the authorization of sports betting at licensed casinos, should sports betting become legal under federal law. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board has begun the process of implementing these gaming expansion efforts. Any expansion of gaming in Pennsylvania could further erode Atlantic City market share. 
New York.    In New York, there are currently two large scale gaming facilities operating with video lottery terminals ("VLT") in the New York City metropolitan area, Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway and Resort World at Aqueduct Racetrack. In addition, current New York law authorizes seven casinos as well as two additional New York metropolitan VLT facilities to be built in coming years. Under the law, New York has approved three commercial Class III casino licenses (which entitle the operators to offer slot machines and table games). Resort World Catskills in Monticello, New York is expected to compete with Atlantic City for customers from the New York City metropolitan area and is planned to open in March 2018. The other three casinos in Schenectady, the Finger Lakes region and the Southern Tier region of New York are not expected to have a large impact on Atlantic City.
Competition from two New York VLT facilities, Resort World at Aqueduct and Empire City at Yonkers, have impacted Atlantic City casinos, and competition from the additional approved commercial casinos and VLT facilities in and around the New York City metropolitan area could further adversely impact Atlantic City casinos, including Tropicana AC.
Maryland.    There are currently six casino gaming facilities open in Maryland, including the MGM Resorts International National Harbor Casino on the Potomac River in Prince George’s County, which opened in December 2016. We believe these facilities in Maryland, particularly the Baltimore area casinos, have adversely impacted Atlantic City casinos, including Tropicana AC.
Delaware.    Tropicana AC competes with Delaware primarily for gaming customers from the southern New Jersey, southern Pennsylvania and Delaware regions. Three racetrack casinos are currently operating in Delaware: Delaware Park, Dover Downs and Harrington Raceway and Casino offering slot machines, table games, intra-state internet gaming and limited parlay sports wagering on national football games.
Connecticut.    Connecticut features two mature resort style Native American casinos, Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort and Casino. In addition, Connecticut has authorized an additional commercial casino in East Windsor, Connecticut, near Hartford, to be operated by a joint venture including the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot Tribes, which currently operate two large gaming facilities located in Connecticut. This proposed casino (which is encountering certain legal challenges) is intended to counter potential lost revenues expected with the opening of the MGM casino in Springfield, Massachusetts. These casinos draw customers from the New York metropolitan area and southern New England that had traditionally gambled in Atlantic City. Atlantic City casinos, including Tropicana AC, continue to market against and compete with these facilities for customers in these geographic areas.
Massachusetts.  Massachusetts law allows for three resort casinos to be constructed in the central, southeastern and western parts of the state, and for one slot parlor with a maximum of 1,250 slot machines and no table games. In 2014 an MGM Resorts International proposed casino in Springfield, which is expected to open in September 2018, and a Wynn Resorts proposed casino outside of Boston, which is expected to open in June 2019, were approved and are currently under development. Plans for a third resort casino in southeastern Massachusetts continue to face numerous legal challenges. Penn National Gaming operates a slot parlor in southeastern Massachusetts which opened in June 2015. These facilities will increase northeast gambling competition which had traditionally been monopolized by Atlantic City casinos.
Central
Tropicana Evansville
As the only full service casino within an 85-mile radius of Evansville, Indiana, we believe Tropicana Evansville enjoys a prime location. Its nearest direct competitor, French Lick Casino, is located 85 miles to the northeast. Other casino competitors include: Horseshoe Southern Indiana located 115 miles east; Harrah's Metropolis, Illinois, located 140 miles southwest; and 
 10

four casinos in the St. Louis, Missouri area located approximately 165 miles northwest. Indiana casino competitors include Indiana Grand Racing Casino, located 205 miles northeast; and Hoosier Park located 225 miles northeast. Illinois also allows VLTs in taverns and convenience stores, which impact the overall market with just under 2,000 units within 100 miles of the property.
Legislation to bring casino gambling to neighboring Kentucky has been intermittently introduced dating back to 1988. Now that Kentucky is bordered by five states with legalized gaming it may put additional pressure on the Kentucky legislature to legalize gaming. State leaders have debated for years whether Kentucky, a state with a long tradition of betting on horse races, can offer casino-style gambling at racetracks and new legislative initiatives have been announced from time to time. Although legislation to allow slot machines and table games at the racetracks has thus far been unsuccessful, in 2010 the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission (the "KHRC") approved regulations permitting Instant Racing to be operated by Kentucky's racetracks. Instant Racing, a game also in use in Arkansas, allows players to bet on historical races that are chosen at random and shown on a video screen. Although the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that pari-mutual wagering on historic horse races is legal, ongoing challenges continue in the Kentucky courts for a determination as to whether wagering on historic horse races utilizing Instant Racing machines is in fact pari-mutual wagering. In 2012, Ellis Park, a thoroughbred racetrack in Henderson, Kentucky located approximately eight driving miles south of Tropicana Evansville, installed approximately 200 Instant Racing machines at its racetrack. The financial results of Tropicana Evansville could be adversely affected if Instant Racing at Ellis Park continues or is expanded, or if casino-style gaming is legalized in Kentucky.
Lumière Place
Lumière Place competes with five other casinos in the St. Louis region. The state of Missouri offers favorable competitive dynamics for current operators as the number of gaming licenses in the state is limited to 13, all of which have been awarded and are currently operating. Lumière also faces competition from the growing Illinois VLT industry across the Mississippi River from the property.
West
Tropicana Laughlin
Tropicana Laughlin is located in southern Nevada on the Colorado River which forms the boundary between Nevada and Arizona. Tropicana Laughlin competes primarily with other Laughlin hotels and casinos located along the Colorado River based on a mix of casino games, personal service, payout ratios, price of hotel rooms, restaurant value and promotions. The Laughlin market is a value-oriented destination for travelers seeking an alternative to the fast-paced Las Vegas experience.
Tropicana Laughlin also competes with casinos in nearby locations, including the Mojave tribe's casino situated eight miles south of Laughlin, Native American casinos in Arizona and California, and numerous casinos in Las Vegas.
MontBleu
The South Lake Tahoe area consists of five casino properties including MontBleu. In 2015, one of our competitors, across the street from our MontBleu property, significantly renovated its property including additional gaming positions and rebranded the property under the "Hard Rock" brand. There are also three other casinos on the north shore of Lake Tahoe, which are approximately 25 miles from the South Lake Tahoe market, numerous casinos located in Reno, Nevada and several casinos located in Carson City and Carson Valley, Nevada. Gaming revenues in the South Lake Tahoe area are also adversely affected by the ongoing proliferation of Native American gaming in northern California.
South
Trop Greenville
Trop Greenville and Harlow's Casino are currently the only licensed gaming facilities in the Greenville, Mississippi market and primarily compete against each other. Several potential gaming sites still exist in or near Greenville, and from time to time potential competitors have proposed the development of additional casinos. To a lesser extent, the Greenville market also competes with the Vicksburg market which is 90 miles to the south and the Tunica, Mississippi market which is 115 miles to the northeast.
Belle of Baton Rouge
Belle of Baton Rouge is currently one of two licensed dockside riverboat gaming facilities operating in downtown Baton Rouge. In addition, although the L'Auberge Casino and Hotel, which is located approximately eight miles southeast of 
 11

downtown Baton Rouge on approximately 575 acres, has grown the market since opening in 2012, it has had a material adverse effect on the downtown Baton Rouge riverboat casinos, including the Belle of Baton Rouge.
Belle of Baton Rouge faces competition from land-based and riverboat casinos throughout Louisiana and Mississippi, including Native American casinos. Belle of Baton Rouge also faces competition from casinos on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, which is approximately 120 miles east of Baton Rouge, as well as from New Orleans, which is approximately 75 miles from Baton Rouge and from Native American casinos located within 65 miles of Baton Rouge. In addition, slot machines in non-casino venues such as truck stops, restaurants, bars and off-track betting facilities located in Louisiana provide additional competition. In 2017, East Baton Rouge Parish passed an ordinance which bans smoking in bars and casinos located within the parish, effective June 1, 2018. Belle of Baton Rouge and two competitor gaming properties are located in the area that will be impacted by the smoking ban.
Tropicana Aruba
There are currently thirteen resort properties with operating casinos in Aruba including our hotel, timeshare and casino resort property. We compete directly with the La Cabana Timeshare Resort which is located immediately adjacent to our resort and includes an approximately 8,500 square-foot casino containing approximately 180 slot machines and eight table games. We do not expect that the Aruban casino market will experience any additional significant growth as casino licenses in Aruba are only granted to hotels with an average of 350 rooms and no additional projects of the requisite size have been announced. The operating casinos located in Aruba, including at Tropicana Aruba, can be categorized as amenities to resort operations.
Governmental Regulation
General Governmental and Gaming Regulations
The following is a summary of the provisions of the laws and regulations applicable to our gaming operations and other laws and regulations applicable to us. The summary does not purport to be a full description thereof and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such laws and regulations.
The ownership and operation of our gaming facilities is subject to pervasive regulation under the laws and regulations of each of the six states in which we operate, Nevada, New Jersey, Mississippi, Missouri, Indiana and Louisiana, as well as of Aruba where we operate a small casino. Gaming laws generally are based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect gaming consumers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize state and local revenues derived through taxes and licensing fees imposed on the gaming industry participants as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character and financial fitness. In addition, gaming laws generally require gaming industry participants to:

• | establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;


• | maintain effective controls over their financial practices, including establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;


• | maintain systems for reliable record keeping;


• | file periodic reports with gaming regulators;


• | ensure that contracts and financial transactions are commercially reasonable, reflect fair market value, and are arm's-length transactions entered into with suitable persons;


• | establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices; and


• | establish programs to promote responsible gaming.

Typically, a jurisdiction's regulatory environment is established by statute and is administered by a regulatory agency with broad discretion to regulate, among other things, the affairs of owners, managers and persons with financial interests in gaming operations. Among other things, gaming authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate:

• | adopt rules and regulations under the implementing statutes;


• | interpret and enforce gaming laws, rules and regulations;


• | impose disciplinary sanctions for violations, including fines and penalties;


• | review the character and financial fitness of participants in gaming operations and make determinations regarding their suitability or qualification for participation and licensure;


• | grant licenses for participation in gaming operations and authorize renewals of those licenses on a periodic basis;


• | collect and review reports and information submitted by participants in gaming operations;

 12


• | review and approve certain transactions, such as acquisitions or change-of-control transactions, of gaming industry participants, securities offerings and debt transactions engaged in by such participants; and


• | establish and collect fees and taxes.

Any change in the laws or regulations of a gaming jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our gaming operations.
Licensing
Gaming laws require us and certain of our subsidiaries, as well as our directors, officers (with respect to corporations), managers (with respect to limited liability companies), and certain other key employees and, in some cases, certain of our shareholders, (with respect to corporations), members (with respect to limited liability companies), and holders of debt securities, to obtain licenses, findings of suitability or other approvals from gaming authorities. Licenses or findings of suitability typically require a determination that the applicant is suitable or otherwise qualifies to hold the license or to merit the finding of suitability necessary to hold equity, debt securities or position with the gaming licensee or its affiliated entities. Where not mandated by statute, rule or regulation, gaming authorities generally have broad discretion in determining who must apply for a license or finding of suitability and whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable or otherwise qualified.
To determine whether to grant a license or finding of suitability to an entity to conduct gaming operations, gaming authorities generally consider the following factors (which vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate):

• | the financial stability, integrity, and responsibility of the applicant, including whether the operation is adequately capitalized in the state and exhibits the ability to maintain adequate insurance levels;


• | the quality of the applicant's casino facilities, support facilities and equipment;


• | the amount of revenue to be derived by the applicable state from the operation of the applicant's casino;


• | the applicant's practices with respect to diversity in employment and procurement;


• | the effect on competition and general impact on the community; and


• | the good character, honesty and integrity of the applicant and its parent entities.

Many gaming jurisdictions limit the number of licenses granted to operate casinos within the state, and some states limit the number of licenses granted to a single gaming operator or the number of licenses in which an investor may hold an ownership interest. Licenses under gaming laws generally are not transferable. Licenses in most of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming operations are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time. The failure to obtain or renew any of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our gaming operations.
In evaluating individual applicants, gaming authorities generally consider the individual's business probity and casino experience, the individual's reputation for good character, honesty, and integrity, the individual's criminal and financial history and the character and reputation of those with whom the individual associates.
Findings of Qualification and Suitability Determinations
As noted above, gaming authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material involvement with our operations to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed or found suitable as a business associate of a gaming licensee. In many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, our directors, officers (with respect to corporations), managers (with respect to limited liability companies), and certain other key employees must file applications with the gaming authorities and may be required to be licensed, qualify, or otherwise be found suitable. Qualification and suitability determinations generally require the submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant must pay all the costs of the investigation. Changes with respect to the individuals who occupy licensed positions must be reported to gaming authorities and—in addition to their authority to deny an application for licensure, qualification, or a finding of suitability—gaming authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.
If one or more gaming authorities were to find that a director, officer (with respect to corporations), manager (with respect to limited liability companies), or other key employee of ours does not qualify, is unsuitable for licensing or is unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we may be required to sever all relationships with such person. In addition, gaming authorities may require that we terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.
Moreover, in many jurisdictions, certain holders of our debt and equity securities may be required to undergo a suitability investigation similar to that described above. All of the jurisdictions in which we operate require any person who acquires 
 13

beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities, and, in some jurisdictions, also non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to the gaming authorities, and the gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability. Most jurisdictions provide that "institutional investors" may seek a waiver of these requirements. In such jurisdictions, an "institutional investor" generally is defined as a qualified investor (i.e., certain banks, insurance companies, investment companies or advisors) acquiring and holding voting securities (or non-voting securities in jurisdictions that do not make a distinction between voting and non-voting securities) in the ordinary course of business for passive investment purposes only, and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the gaming entity's board of directors, any change in such entity's corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies, or operations, or those of any of such entity's affiliates, or the taking of any other action that gaming authorities find to be inconsistent with holding the securities solely for passive investment purposes. Even if a waiver is granted, an institutional investor generally may not take any action inconsistent with its status when the waiver was granted without once again becoming subject to the foregoing reporting and application obligations.
The definition of an "institutional investor" varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, in order to obtain a qualification waiver, some jurisdictions, including Nevada, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Indiana and New Jersey, require an institutional investor to certify to, among other things, its intent and purpose in acquiring and holding an issuer's securities. In Indiana, an institutional investor that acquires, directly or indirectly, the beneficial ownership of 15% or more of a public gaming company's voting securities must apply for a finding of suitability within 45 days after acquiring the securities. The definition of "public company" varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but in general, a public company is one that has a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). In Mississippi, an institutional investor that acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of more than 10% of a gaming company's voting securities must apply to the Mississippi Gaming Commission for a finding of suitability within thirty days of acquiring said interest. However, if the institutional investor holds such voting securities for investment purposes only, and, under certain circumstances, such an investor that has obtained a waiver can hold, directly or indirectly, up to 19% of the voting securities of a public gaming company for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver. In Missouri, licensing requirements will be imposed upon any holder of an aggregate ownership interest of 5% or more of a publicly-traded gaming company’s voting securities, unless such holder applies for and obtains an institutional investor exemption in accordance with the Missouri gaming regulations which require, among other things, certification by the institutional investor of its passive ownership status. The Executive Director of the Missouri Gaming Commission may grant a waiver to an institutional investor that holds up to 10% of the outstanding equity of a Missouri licensee. The Missouri Gaming Commission itself may grant a waiver to an institutional investor that holds up to 20% of the outstanding equity of the Missouri licensee.
In Nevada, beneficial owners of more than 10% of a public gaming company's voting securities must apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board mails a written notice requiring the filing of an application for such a finding. However, an institutional investor that beneficially owns more than 10% but not more than 11% of a public gaming company's voting securities as a result of a stock repurchase by the public gaming company may not be required to file such an application. Additionally, an institutional investor that acquires more than 10% but not more than 25% of a public gaming company's voting securities may apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a waiver of these application requirements if the investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may own more than 25% but not more than 29% of a public gaming company's voting securities and maintain the waiver where the additional ownership results from a stock repurchase by the public gaming company.
In New Jersey, gaming laws permit an institutional investor holding either under 25% of the equity securities of a casino licensee's holding or intermediary companies, or debt securities of a casino licensee's holding or intermediary companies, or another subsidiary company of a casino licensee's holding or intermediary companies which is related in any way to the financing of the casino licensee, where the securities represent a portion of the outstanding debt of the company not exceeding 25% or a percentage of any issue of the outstanding debt of the company not exceeding 50%, unless the full issue is in the amount of $150 million or less (in which case no qualification is required), shall be granted a waiver of the qualification requirement if the securities are those of a corporation, whether publicly traded or privately held, and its holdings of such securities were purchased for investment purposes only and the institutional investor provides a certification which, among other things, confirms that its holdings of such securities were purchased for investment purposes only. The Director of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement ("NJDGE") may grant a waiver of the qualification requirement to an institutional investor holding a higher percentage of such securities upon a showing of good cause and compliance with the certification submission requirement.
 14

In Aruba, any direct or indirect holder of an Aruban casino license is required to provide certain information, including information regarding its ownership. Information required to be provided by the owners of a license holder includes the number of shares of the license holder held as well as a certificate of good standing.
Generally, in each of the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within the prescribed period after being advised by gaming authorities that it is required to do so may be denied a license or found unsuitable or unqualified, as applicable. Any holder of equity securities that is found unsuitable or unqualified or denied a license, and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of a gaming entity's equity securities beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the applicable gaming authorities may be guilty of a criminal offense. Furthermore, a gaming entity may be subject to disciplinary action if such gaming entity, after receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a holder of equity securities or to have any other relationship with such gaming entity or any of its subsidiaries: (i) pays that person any dividend or interest upon the securities; (ii) allows that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; (iii) pays remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; (iv) allows that person to continue an ownership or economic interest or receive any economic benefit or remain as a member, beneficial owner, officer or partner of a licensee; or (v) fails to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish the securities including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of such securities for the lesser of fair value at the time of repurchase or fair value at the time of acquisition by the unsuitable holder. In the event that disqualified holders fail to divest themselves of such securities, gaming authorities have the power to revoke or suspend the casino license or licenses related to the regulated entity that issued the securities.
Our certificate of incorporation includes provisions establishing our ability to redeem the securities of unsuitable holders if (i) the holder is determined by a gaming authority, or if we have been notified by the staff of a gaming authority that it will recommend that the gaming authority determine the holder to be, unsuitable, unqualified, or disqualified to own or control such securities or unsuitable to be connected with a person engaged in gaming activities in that jurisdiction, or (ii) the holder is deemed likely to preclude or materially delay, impede, impair or jeopardize our application for or ability to obtain, right to the use of or ability to reinstate or retain any gaming license, or to result in the imposition of materially burdensome terms of or conditions on any gaming license.
Some of the gaming jurisdictions in which we operate also require that suppliers of certain goods and services to gaming industry participants be licensed or otherwise approved, and require that we purchase and lease gaming equipment, supplies, and services only from such licensed or approved suppliers.
Violations of Gaming Laws
The gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate may also, among other things, limit, condition, suspend, or revoke a gaming license or approval to own the equity or joint venture interests of any of our operations in such licensing authority's jurisdiction for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority. In addition, if our subsidiaries violate applicable gaming laws, their gaming licenses could be limited, conditioned, suspended, or revoked by gaming authorities, and we and any other persons and entities involved could be subject to substantial fines. Further, gaming authorities may appoint a supervisor or conservator to operate our gaming properties or, in some jurisdictions, take title to our gaming assets. Under certain circumstances, earnings generated during such appointment could be forfeited to the applicable state or states. Furthermore, violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions and, as a result, violations by us of applicable gaming laws in one jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on all of our gaming operations. Finally, some gaming jurisdictions prohibit certain types of political activity by a gaming licensee, its directors, officers (with respect to corporations), managers (with respect to limited liability companies), and certain other key people. In Indiana, for example, a licensee or a person with an interest in a licensee is prohibited from making certain political contributions. A violation of such a prohibition may subject the offender to criminal charges and disciplinary action.
Reporting and Record-Keeping Requirements of Gaming Authorities
We are periodically required to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information that gaming authorities may require. Under federal law, we are required to record and submit detailed reports of currency transactions at our casinos involving greater than $10,000, as well as any suspicious activity that may occur at such facilities. Additionally, we are required to maintain a current stock ledger that may be examined by gaming authorities at any time. In addition, gaming authorities may require that our Common Stock certificates bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified gaming laws.
 15

Review and Approval by Gaming Authorities of Certain Transactions
Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities, and similar financing transactions by us must be reported to, and in some cases, requires the prior approval of gaming authorities. We may not make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of certain gaming authorities. Changes in control through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or otherwise, are subject to prior approval of gaming authorities. Entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our subsidiaries must satisfy gaming authorities with respect to a variety of standards prior to assuming control. Gaming authorities may also require controlling stockholders, directors, officers (with respect to corporations), managers (with respect to limited liability companies), and certain other key employees having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed, qualified, or found suitable as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.
Because of regulatory restrictions, our ability to grant a security interest in any of our gaming assets is limited and subject to receipt of approval by gaming authorities. Some jurisdictions, including Nevada, Louisiana, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Aruba, prohibit the transfer of a gaming license or the granting of a security interest in the same.
License for Sale of Alcoholic Beverages
The service and sale of alcoholic beverages at our various casinos are subject to licensing, control and regulation by various governmental authorities, some of which have the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling stock, and all directors and officers in a manner similar to the gaming suitability determinations discussed above. Although these authorities, with the exception of Indiana, Louisiana and Mississippi, typically defer to the suitability determinations of the relevant gaming authority in their jurisdiction, they retain the jurisdiction to conduct any investigation and take any regulatory action deemed appropriate under the circumstances. Any holder found to be unsuitable by such an authority must dispose of held securities, and such securities would be subject to repurchase by us, as provided in our certificate of incorporation. In New Jersey, the authority to grant any license for, or to permit or prohibit the presence of, alcoholic beverages in, on, or about any premises licensed as part of a casino hotel is exclusively vested in the NJDGE.
Other Regulations
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters (see "—Environmental Matters"), currency transactions, employees, taxation, zoning and building codes, marketing and advertising, vessels and permanently moored craft. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business.
Trademarks
We use a variety of trade names, service marks and trademarks and have all the rights and licenses necessary to conduct our continuing operations. We have registered several service marks and trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or otherwise acquired the licenses to use those which are material to the conduct of our business. We own the following federally registered trademarks or service marks that are material to our business: MontBleu, Aztar, Trop, Tropicana, Belle of Baton Rouge, Trop Advantage, the Quarter at Tropicana and Lumière.
Tropicana Trademark
We along with certain entities that own Tropicana Las Vegas (“Tropicana LV”) are parties to a trademark Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) governing the respective rights of the parties to the “Tropicana” trademark. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, which became effective on September 28, 2011, the Tropicana LV entities, subject to certain advertising exceptions and other terms and conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement, have perpetual exclusive rights to use the names, trademarks, and/or service marks TROPICANA LAS VEGAS (or TROP LAS VEGAS) and TROPICANA LV (or TROP LV) (the “TLV Marks”, as defined in the Settlement Agreement) in conjunction with its services (“Services”, as defined in the Settlement Agreement) in the City of Las Vegas, Nevada and within a 50-mile radius of the front entrance of the Tropicana Las Vegas Hotel and Casino located at 3801 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada (the “TLV Territory”) along with certain rights to use the TLV Marks on the Internet without geographic limitation and to register the TLV Marks as domain names. TEI and its affiliates, subject to certain advertising exceptions and other terms and conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement, have perpetual exclusive worldwide rights (excluding the TLV Territory) to use the TROPICANA and TROP Marks coupled with either a pre-existing identifier of its Services (such as "TROPICANA ENTERTAINMENT" or 
 16

"TROP ADVANTAGE") or an accurate geographic identifier of the location of a Tropicana Entertainment property (other than LAS VEGAS or the name of any city within the TLV Territory) (the “TE Marks”) along with certain rights to use the TE Marks on the Internet without geographic limitation and to register the TE Marks as domain names.
Seasonality
Our cash flows from operating activities are seasonal in nature. Operating results are traditionally the strongest in the third quarter and traditionally the weakest during the fourth quarter. Any excess cash flows achieved from operations during the peak seasons are used to subsidize non-peak seasons. Performance in non-peak seasons is usually dependent on favorable weather and a long-weekend holiday calendar. In the event that we are not able to generate excess cash flows during the peak seasons, we may not be able to fully subsidize non-peak seasons.
Environmental Matters
We have to address, and are liable for, hazardous materials or contamination on our properties. Some of our properties currently have or had in the past underground fuel storage tanks and construction materials containing asbestos. We may become liable for contamination on our properties that was caused by former owners or operators. Our ongoing operations are subject to stringent regulations relating to protection of the environment and handling of waste, particularly with respect to the management of wastewater from the facilities. See "Item 1A—Risk Factors—Noncompliance with environmental, health and safety regulations applicable to our hotels and casinos could adversely affect our results of operations."
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 7,200 employees and had collective bargaining agreements with several unions covering approximately 2,800 of those employees, substantially all of whom are employed at Tropicana AC, Lumière Place, Belle of Baton Rouge and Tropicana Evansville. 
Financial Information
See "Item 6.—Selected Financial Data" and "Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information about our revenues and operating results and "Item 15.—Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules" for our financial statements and accompanying footnotes.
