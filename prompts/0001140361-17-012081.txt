Item 1.   Business
General
 
The Holding Company is a Delaware corporation and parent company of the Bank, a New York State chartered savings bank. The Bank maintains its headquarters in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York, and as of December 31, 2016, operated twenty-five full service retail banking offices located in the New York City (“NYC”) boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, and in Nassau County, New York. The Bank opened two additional branches located in Brooklyn, New York in February 2017. The Bank’s principal business is gathering deposits from customers within its market area and via the internet, and investing them primarily in multifamily residential, commercial real estate and mixed use loans, mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), obligations of the U.S. Government and Government Sponsored Entities (“GSEs”), and corporate debt and equity securities.  All of the Bank’s lending occurs in the greater NYC metropolitan area.  The Bank’s revenues are derived principally from interest on its loan and securities portfolios, and other investments. The Bank’s primary sources of funds are, in general, deposits; loan amortization, prepayments and maturities; MBS amortization, prepayments and maturities; investment securities maturities and sales; and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”).
 
 F-3
 

The primary business of the Holding Company is the ownership of its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. The Holding Company is a unitary savings and loan holding company, which, under existing law, is generally not restricted as to the types of business activities in which it may engage.
 
The Holding Company neither owns nor leases any property, but instead uses the premises and equipment of the Bank.  The Holding Company employs no persons other than certain officers of the Bank, who receive no additional compensation as officers of the Holding Company.  The Holding Company utilizes the support staff of the Bank from time to time, as required.  Additional employees may be hired as deemed appropriate by Holding Company management.
 
The Company’s website address is www.dime.com. The Company makes available free of charge through its website, by clicking the Investor Relations tab and selecting “SEC Filings” under “Investor Menu,” its Annual and Transition Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 
Market Area and Competition
 
The Bank has historically operated as a community-oriented financial institution providing financial services and loans primarily for multifamily housing within its market areas.  The Bank maintains its headquarters in the borough of Brooklyn, New York, and as of December 31, 2016 operated twenty-five full-service retail banking offices located in the NYC boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, and in Nassau County, New York.  The Bank opened two additional branches located in Brooklyn, New York in February 2017.  The Bank gathers deposits primarily from the communities and neighborhoods in close proximity to its branches, and via the internet.  The Bank’s primary lending area is the NYC metropolitan area, although it’s overall lending area is larger, extending approximately 50 miles in each direction from its corporate headquarters in Brooklyn.  The majority of the Bank’s mortgage loans are secured by properties located in its primary lending area, with approximately 89% secured by real estate located in the NYC boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan on December 31, 2016.
 
The NYC banking environment is extremely competitive.  The Bank’s competition for loans exists principally from other savings banks, commercial banks, mortgage banks, internet banks and insurance companies. The Bank continues to face sustained competition for the origination of multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans, which together comprised 99% of the Bank’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2016.
 
The Bank gathers deposits in direct competition with other savings banks, commercial banks and brokerage firms, many among the largest in the nation.  It must additionally compete for deposit monies with the stock and bond markets, especially during periods of strong performance in those arenas.  Over the previous decade, consolidation in the financial services industry, coupled with the emergence of Internet banking, has dramatically altered the deposit gathering landscape.  Facing increasingly larger and more efficient competitors, the Bank’s strategy to attract depositors has utilized various marketing approaches and the delivery of technology-enhanced, customer-friendly banking services while controlling operating expenses.
 
Banking competition occurs within an economic and financial marketplace that is largely beyond the control of any individual financial institution.  The interest rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, while affected by marketplace competition, are generally a function of broader-based macroeconomic and financial factors, including the U.S. Gross Domestic Product, the supply of, and demand for, loanable funds, and the impact of global trade and international financial markets.  Within this environment, Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) monetary policy and governance of short-term rates also significantly influence the interest rates paid and charged by financial institutions.
 
The Bank’s success is additionally impacted by the overall condition of the economy, particularly in the NYC metropolitan area.  As home to several national companies in the financial and business services industries, and as a popular destination for domestic and international travelers, the NYC economy is particularly sensitive to the health of both the national and global economies.

Lending Activities
 
The Bank originates primarily non-recourse loans on multifamily and commercial real estate properties to limited liability companies. The Bank’s lending is subject to the Bank’s lending policies, which are approved by the Board’s Lending and CRA Committee on an annual basis.  The types of loans the Bank may originate are subject to New York State laws and regulations (See “Item 1.  Business - Regulation – Regulation of New York State Chartered Savings Banks”).
 
The Board of Directors of the Bank establishes lending authority levels for the various loan products offered by the Bank. The Bank maintains a Loan Operating Committee which, as of December 31, 2016, consisted of the Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Retail Officer, and Director of Credit Administration.  The Loan Operating Committee may approve any portfolio loan origination, however, larger loans, generally in excess of $500,000, require its approval. All loans approved by the Loan Operating Committee are presented to the Bank’s Board of Directors for its review.
 
The Bank originates both adjustable-rate mortgages (“ARMs”) and fixed-rate loans, depending upon customer demand and market rates of interest.
 
Multifamily Residential Lending and Commercial Real Estate Lending
 
The majority of the Bank’s lending activities consist of originating adjustable- and fixed-rate multifamily residential (generally buildings possessing a minimum of five residential units) and commercial real estate loans. The properties securing these loans are generally located in the Bank’s primary lending area.
 
Multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank were secured by three distinct property types as of December 31, 2016: (1) fully residential apartment buildings; (2) “mixed-use” properties featuring a combination of residential and commercial units within the same building; and (3) fully commercial buildings. The underwriting procedures for each of these property types were substantially similar.  The Bank classified loans secured 80% to 100% by income from residential apartment buildings as multifamily residential loans in all instances. Loans secured by fully commercial real estate were classified as commercial real estate loans in all instances. Loans secured by mixed-use properties were classified as either residential mixed use (a component of total multifamily residential loans) or commercial mixed use (a component of total commercial real estate loans) based upon the percentage of the property’s rental income received from its residential as compared to its commercial tenants. If 20% to 80% of the rental income was received from residential tenants, the full balance of the loan was classified as multifamily mixed-use residential. If less than 20% of the rental income was received from residential tenants, the full balance of the loan was classified as mixed-use commercial real estate.
 
Multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans in the Bank’s portfolio generally range in amount from $250,000 to $5.0 million. Multifamily residential loans in this range are generally secured by buildings that contain between 5 and 100 apartments.
 
The typical multifamily residential and commercial real estate ARM carries a final maturity of 10 or 12 years, and an amortization period not exceeding 30 years. These loans generally have an interest rate that adjusts once after the fifth or seventh year, indexed to the 5-year FHLBNY advance rate plus a spread typically approximating 250 basis points, but generally may not adjust below the initial interest rate of the loan. Prepayment fees are assessed throughout the majority of the life of the loans. The Bank may also offer interest only loans, i.e. loans that do not amortize principal during part of the contractual maturity period. The Bank also offers fixed-rate, self-amortizing, multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans with maturities of up to fifteen years.
 
Multifamily residential real estate loans are either retained in the Bank’s portfolio or sold in the secondary market to other third-party financial institutions.  The Bank currently has no formal arrangement pursuant to which it sells commercial or multifamily residential real estate loans to the secondary market.
 
 F-5
 

Repayment of multifamily residential loans is dependent, in significant part, on cash flow from the collateral property sufficient to satisfy operating expenses and debt service. Future increases in interest rates, increases in vacancy rates on multifamily residential or commercial buildings, and other economic events which are outside the control of the borrower or the Bank could negatively impact the future net operating income of such properties.  Similarly, government regulations, such as the existing NYC Rent Regulation and Rent Stabilization laws, could limit future increases in the revenue from these buildings.  As a result, rental income might not rise sufficiently over time to satisfy increases in either the loan rate at repricing or in overhead expenses (e.g., utilities, taxes, and insurance).
 
The Bank’s underwriting standards for multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans generally require: (1) a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% based upon an appraisal performed by an independent, state licensed appraiser, and (2) sufficient rental income from the underlying property to adequately service the debt, represented by a minimum debt service ratio of 120% for multifamily residential and 125% for commercial real estate loans. The weighted average loan-to-value and debt service ratios approximated 64% and 147%, respectively, on all multifamily residential real estate loans originated during the year ended December 31, 2016, and 53% and 218%, respectively, on commercial real estate loans originated during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Bank additionally requires all multifamily residential and commercial real estate borrowers to represent that they are unaware of any environmental risks directly related to the collateral.  In instances where the Bank’s property inspection procedures indicate a potential environmental risk on a collateral property, the Bank will require a Phase 1 environmental risk analysis to be completed, and will decline loans where any significant residual environmental liability is indicated.  The Bank further considers the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar properties, the Bank’s lending experience with the borrower, and the borrower’s credit history and business experience.
 
 It is the Bank's policy to require appropriate insurance protection at closing, including title, hazard, and when applicable, flood insurance, on all real estate mortgage loans. Borrowers generally are required to advance funds for certain expenses such as real estate taxes, hazard insurance and flood insurance.
 
Commercial real estate loans are generally viewed as exposing lenders to a greater risk of loss than both one- to four-family and multifamily residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are often dependent upon successful operation or management of the collateral properties, as well as the success of the business and retail tenants occupying the properties, repayment of such loans is generally more vulnerable to weak economic conditions. Further, the collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise, or fluctuate in value based upon its rentability, among other commercial factors.  This increased risk is partially mitigated in the following manners: (i) the Bank requires, in addition to the security interest in the commercial real estate, a security interest in the personal property associated with the collateral and standby assignments of rents and leases from the borrower; (ii) the Bank will generally favor investments in mixed-use commercial properties that derive some portion of income from residential units, which provide a more reliable source of cash flow and lower vacancy rates, and (iii) the interest rate on commercial real estate loans generally exceeds that on multifamily residential loans.
 
As a New York State-chartered savings bank originating loans secured by real estate having a market value at least equal to the loan amount at the time of origination, the Bank is generally not subject to the regulations of its primary regulators, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYSDFS”) limiting individual loan or borrower exposures.
 
One- to Four-Family Residential and Condominium / Cooperative Apartment Lending
 
Prior to February 2013, the Bank generally sold its newly originated one- to four-family fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market.  During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Bank ceased all one- to four-family fixed-rate mortgage lending in order to focus on its core multifamily residential and commercial real estate lending activities.
 
 F-6
 

Home Equity and Home Improvement Loans
 
The Bank ceased origination of home equity and home improvement loans during the year ended December 31, 2013.  Home equity loans and home improvement loans, the great majority of which are included in one- to four-family loans, were previously originated to a maximum of $500,000.  The combined balance of the first mortgage and home equity or home improvement loan was not permitted to exceed 75% of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination of the home equity or home improvement loan.  Interest on home equity and home improvement loans was initially the “prime lending” rate at the time of origination.  After six months, the interest rate adjusts and ranges from the prime interest rate to 100 basis points above the prime interest rate in effect at the time.  The interest rate on the loan can never fall below the rate at origination.
Equity Lines of Credit on Multifamily Residential and Commercial Real Estate Loans
 
Equity credit lines are available on multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans.  These loans are underwritten in the same manner as first mortgage loans on these properties, except that the combined first mortgage amount and equity line are used to determine the loan-to-value ratio and minimum debt service coverage ratio.  The interest rate on multifamily residential and commercial real estate equity lines of credit adjusts regularly.
 
Commercial and Industrial (“C&I”) Loans
 
As part of its strategic plans for 2017, the Bank is taking steps to grow the C&I loan portfolio. Under this new initiative, the types of products anticipated in the C&I portfolio will include acquisition, land development and construction loans (“ADC”), finance loans and leases, and Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans in which a portion is guaranteed by the SBA. The Bank did not originate any loans as of December 31, 2016 under this initiative, and had no unfunded construction loan commitments or outstanding ADC loans at December 31, 2016.
 
Asset Quality
 
General
 
The Bank does not originate or purchase loans, either whole loans or loans underlying MBS, which would have been considered subprime loans at origination, i.e., mortgage loans advanced to borrowers who did not qualify for market interest rates because of problems with their income or credit history.  See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impaired investment securities and MBS.
Monitoring and Collection of Delinquent Loans
 
Management of the Bank reviews delinquent loans on a monthly basis and reports to its Board of Directors at each regularly scheduled Board meeting regarding the status of all non-performing and otherwise delinquent loans in the Bank’s portfolio.
 
The Bank’s loan servicing policies and procedures require that an automated late notice be sent to a delinquent borrower as soon as possible after a payment is ten days late in the case of multifamily residential or commercial real estate loans, or fifteen days late in connection with one- to four-family or consumer loans.  A second letter is sent to the borrower if payment has not been received within 30 days of the due date.  Thereafter, periodic letters are mailed and phone calls placed to the borrower until payment is received.  When contact is made with the borrower at any time prior to foreclosure, the Bank will attempt to obtain the full payment due or negotiate a repayment schedule with the borrower to avoid foreclosure.
 
Accrual of interest is generally discontinued on a loan that meets any of the following three criteria:  (i) full payment of principal or interest is not expected; (ii) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more (unless the loan is both deemed to be well secured and in the process of collection); or (iii) an election has otherwise been made to maintain the loan on a cash basis due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower.  Such non-accrual determination practices are applied consistently to all loans regardless of their internal classification or designation.  Upon entering non-accrual status, the Bank reverses all outstanding accrued interest receivable.
 
 F-7
 

The Bank generally initiates foreclosure proceedings when a loan enters non-accrual status based upon non-payment, and typically does not accept partial payments once foreclosure proceedings have commenced.  At some point during foreclosure proceedings, the Bank procures current appraisal information in order to prepare an estimate of the fair value of the underlying collateral.  If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure action is completed, the property securing the loan is transferred to Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) status.  The Bank generally attempts to utilize all available remedies, such as note sales in lieu of foreclosure, in an effort to resolve non-accrual loans and OREO properties as quickly and prudently as possible in consideration of market conditions, the physical condition of the property and any other mitigating circumstances.  In the event that a non-accrual loan is subsequently brought current, it is returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectability has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated performance in accordance with the loan terms and conditions for a period of at least six months.
 
Troubled Debt Restructured Loans (“TDRs”)
 
 Under ASC 310-40-15, the Bank is required to recognize loans for which certain modifications or concessions have been made as TDRs.  A TDR has been created in the event that, for economic or legal reasons, a concession has been granted that would not have otherwise been considered to a debtor experiencing financial difficulties. The following criteria are considered concessions:

· | A reduction of interest rate has been made for the remaining term of the loan
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The maturity date of the loan has been extended with a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The outstanding principal amount and/or accrued interest have been reduced
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In instances in which the interest rate has been reduced, management would not deem the modification a TDR in the event that the reduction in interest rate reflected either a general decline in market interest rates or an effort to maintain a relationship with a borrower who could readily obtain funds from other sources at the current market interest rate, and the terms of the restructured loan are comparable to the terms offered by the Bank to non-troubled debtors.
 
Accrual status for TDRs is determined separately for each TDR in accordance with the policies for determining accrual or non-accrual status that are outlined in the previous section titled “Monitoring and Collection of Delinquent Loans.” At the time an agreement is entered into between the Bank and the borrower that results in the Bank’s determination that a TDR has been created, the loan can be either on accrual or non-accrual status.  If a loan is on non-accrual status at the time it is restructured, it continues to be classified as non-accrual until the borrower has demonstrated compliance with the modified loan terms for a period of at least six months.  Conversely, if at the time of restructuring the loan is performing (and accruing); it will remain accruing throughout its restructured period, unless the loan subsequently meets any of the criteria for non-accrual status under the Bank’s policy and agency regulations.
 
The Bank never accepts receivables or equity interests in satisfaction of TDRs.
 
For TDRs that demonstrate conditions sufficient to warrant accrual status, the present value of the expected net cash flows of the underlying property is utilized as the primary means of determining impairment.  Any shortfall in the present value of the expected net cash flows calculated at each measurement period (typically quarter-end) compared to the present value of the expected net cash flows at the time of the original loan agreement was recognized as either an allocated reserve (in the event that it related to lower expected interest payments) or a charge-off (if related to lower expected principal payments).  For TDRs on non-accrual status, an appraisal of the underlying real estate collateral is deemed the most appropriate measure to utilize when evaluating impairment, and any shortfall in valuation from the recorded balance is accounted for through a charge-off.  In the event that either an allocated reserve or a charge-off is recognized on TDRs, the periodic loan loss provision is impacted.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses
 
Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) require the Bank to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses.  The Bank maintains a Loan Loss Reserve Committee charged with, among other functions, responsibility for monitoring the appropriateness of the loan loss reserve.
 
 F-8
 

To assist the Loan Loss Reserve Committee in carrying out its assigned duties, the Bank engages the services of an experienced third-party loan review firm to perform a review of the loan portfolio.  The 2016 review program covered 100% of construction and land development loans and 50% of the non-one- to four-family and consumer loan portfolio.  Included within the annual 50% target were: (1) 100% of the twenty largest loans in the multifamily and commercial real estate loan portfolio; (2) the ten largest pure commercial real estate loans; (3) the ten largest commercial mixed use real estate loans; (4) 100% of the ten largest multifamily residential real estate loans; (5) 100% of the ten largest residential mixed use real estate loans; (6) 30% of all new loan originations during the year; (7) 100% of the internally criticized and classified loans over $250,000; (8) 100% of the twenty largest borrower relationships; (9) 70% of all commercial real estate loans; (10) all loans over $500,000 that were collateralized by properties located in Long Island, New York; (11) all loans over $500,000 that were scheduled to reprice during the year; (12) all loans over $500,000 that were in the lowest three categories of pass loan grade (including Watch list loans); and (13) 50% of loans over $250,000 originated under the small mixed use lending program.
 
The Loan Loss Reserve Committee’s findings, along with recommendations for changes to loan loss reserve provisions, if any, are reported directly to the Bank’s executive management and the Lending and CRA Committee of the Board of Directors.
 
The Loan Loss Reserve Committee evaluates the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis in order to maintain its allowance for loan losses at a level it believes appropriate to absorb probable losses incurred within the Bank’s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet dates.  Factors considered in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses include the Bank’s past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, existing adverse situations which may affect a borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions in the Bank’s lending area.  Although management uses available information to estimate losses on loans, future additions to, or reductions in, the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions or other factors beyond management’s control. In addition, the Bank’s regulators, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the Bank’s allowance for loan losses, and may require the Bank to recognize additions to, or reductions in, the allowance based upon judgments different from those of management.
 
The Bank’s periodic evaluation of its allowance for loan losses has traditionally been comprised of different components, each of which is discussed in Note 5 to the Company’s consolidated audited financial statements.
 
The Bank also maintains a reserve associated with unfunded loan commitments accepted by the borrower.  This reserve is determined based upon the outstanding volume of loan commitments at each period end.  Any increases or reductions in this reserve are recognized in periodic non-interest expense.
 
Investment Activities
 
Investment strategies are implemented by the Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”), which, as of December 31, 2016, was comprised of the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Retail Officer and other senior officers.  The strategies take into account the overall composition of the Bank’s balance sheet, including loans and deposits, and are intended to protect and enhance the Bank’s earnings and market value, and effectively manage both interest rate risk and liquidity.  The strategies are reviewed periodically by the ALCO and reported to the Board of Directors.
 
Investment Policy of the Bank
 
The investment policy of the Bank, which is adopted by its Board of Directors, is designed to help achieve the Bank’s overall asset/liability management objectives while complying with applicable regulations.  Generally, when selecting investments for the Bank’s portfolio, the policy emphasizes principal preservation, liquidity, diversification, short maturities and/or repricing terms, and a favorable return on investment. The policy permits investments in various types of liquid assets, including obligations of the U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, investment grade corporate debt, various types of MBS, commercial paper, certificates of deposit (“CDs”) and overnight federal funds sold to financial institutions.  The Bank’s Board of Directors periodically approves all financial institutions to which the Bank sells federal funds.
 
 F-9
 

The Bank’s investment policy limits a combined investment in securities issued by any one entity, with the exception of obligations of the U.S. Government, federal agencies and GSEs, to an amount not exceeding the lesser of either 2% of its total assets or 15% of its total tangible capital (20% of tangible capital in the event all securities of the obligor maintain a “AAA” credit rating).  The Bank was in compliance with this policy limit at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Bank may, with Board approval, engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments.  During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bank did not hold any derivative instruments or embedded derivative instruments that required bifurcation.
 
Federal Agency Obligations
 
Federal agency obligations are purchased from time to time in order to provide the Bank a favorable yield in comparison to overnight investments.  These securities possess sound credit ratings, and are readily accepted as collateral for the Bank’s borrowings.  The Bank owned no federal agency obligation investments at December 31, 2016.
MBS
 
The Bank’s investment policy calls for the purchase of only priority tranches when investing in MBS, and typically possess the highest credit rating from at least one nationally recognized rating agency. MBS provide the portfolio with investments offering desirable repricing, cash flow and credit quality characteristics. MBS yield less than the loans that underlie the securities as a result of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements which reduce credit risk to the investor.  Although MBS guaranteed by federally sponsored agencies carry a reduced credit risk compared to whole loans, such securities remain subject to the risk that fluctuating interest rates, along with other factors such as the geographic distribution of the underlying mortgage loans, may alter the prepayment rate of such loans and thus affect the value of such securities.  MBS, however, are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may readily be used to collateralize borrowings.  MBS also provide the Company with important interest rate risk management features, as the entire portfolio provides monthly cash flow for re-investment at current market interest rates.
Corporate Debt Obligations
 
The Bank may invest in investment-grade debt obligations of various corporations.  The Bank’s investment policy limits new investments in corporate debt obligations to companies rated single “A” or better by one of the nationally recognized rating agencies at the time of purchase.  As mentioned previously, with certain exceptions, the Bank’s investment policy also limits a combined investment in corporate securities issued by any one entity to an amount not exceeding the lesser of either 2% of its total assets or 15% of its total tangible capital (20% of core capital in the event all securities of the obligor maintain a “AAA” credit rating).
Investment Strategies of the Holding Company
 
The Holding Company’s investment policy generally calls for investments in relatively short-term, liquid securities similar to those permitted by the securities investment policy of the Bank.  The investment policy calls for the purchase of only priority tranches when investing in MBS, limits new investments in corporate debt obligations to companies rated single “A” or better by one of the nationally recognized rating agencies at the time of purchase, and limits investments in any one corporate entity to the lesser of 1% of total assets or 5% of the Company’s total consolidated capital. The Holding Company may, with Board approval, engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Holding Company did not hold any derivative instruments or embedded derivative instruments that required bifurcation.
 
Holding Company investments are generally intended primarily to provide future liquidity which may be utilized for general business activities, including, but not limited to: (1) purchases of the Holding Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) into treasury; (2) repayment of principal and interest on the Holding Company’s $70.7 million trust preferred securities debt; (3) subject to applicable restrictions, the payment of dividends on the Common Stock; and/or (4) investments in the equity securities of other financial institutions and other investments not permitted to the Bank.
 
 F-10
 

The Holding Company cannot assure that it will engage in these investment activities in the future.  At December 31, 2016, the Holding Company’s principal asset was its $571.2 million investment in the Bank’s common stock.  This investment in its subsidiary is not actively managed and falls outside of the Holding Company investment policy and strategy discussed above.
 
GAAP requires that investments in debt securities be classified in one of the following three categories and accounted for accordingly:  trading securities, securities available-for-sale or securities held-to-maturity.  GAAP requires investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values be classified as either trading securities or securities available-for-sale.  Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity referred to as accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of deferred taxes.
 
Sources of Funds
 
General
 
The Bank’s primary sources of funding for its lending and investment activities include deposits, loan and MBS payments, investment security principal and interest payments, and advances from the FHLBNY.  The Bank may also sell selected multifamily residential, mixed use and one- to four-family residential real estate loans to private sector secondary market purchasers and has in the past sold such loans to the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”).  The Company may additionally issue debt under appropriate circumstances.  Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investments are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and prepayments on mortgage loans and MBS are influenced by interest rates, economic conditions and competition.
Deposits
 
The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts possessing a range of interest rates and terms, including savings, money market, interest bearing and non-interest bearing checking accounts, and CDs. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, and competition from other financial institutions and investment products. The Bank relies upon direct and general marketing, customer service, convenience and long-standing relationships with customers or borrowers to generate deposits.  The communities in which the Bank maintains branch offices have historically provided the great majority of its deposits.
 
The Bank is also eligible to participate in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”), through which it can either purchase or sell CDs.  Purchases of CDs through this program are limited by Bank policy to an aggregate of 10% of the Bank’s average interest earning assets.
 
Borrowings
 
The Bank has been a member and shareholder of the FHLBNY since 1980.  One of the privileges offered to FHLBNY shareholders is the ability to secure advances from the FHLBNY under various lending programs at competitive interest rates.

In addition to the Bank, the Holding Company’s direct and indirect subsidiaries consist of nine corporations, two of which are wholly-owned by the Holding Company and seven of which are wholly-owned by the Bank.  The following table presents an overview of the Holding Company’s subsidiaries, other than the Bank, as of December 31, 2016:

Personnel
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had 338 full-time and 45 part-time employees.  The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit, and the Holding Company and all of its subsidiaries consider their relationships with their employees to be good.
Federal, State and Local Taxation
 
The following is a general description of material tax matters and does not purport to be a comprehensive review of the tax rules applicable to the Company.
Federal Taxation
 
For federal income tax purposes, the Company files a consolidated income tax return on a December 31st calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting and is subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including, particularly, the Bank’s tax reserve for bad debts.
State and Local Taxation
 
The Company is subject to New York State (“NYS”) franchise tax on a consolidated basis. NYS recently enacted several reforms (the “Tax Reform Package”) to its tax structure, including changes to the franchise, sales, estate and personal income taxes. These changes generally became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.  The Tax Reform Package is intended to simplify the existing corporate tax code for NYS businesses while remaining relatively neutral in relation to corporate tax receipts.
 
The Company is subject to NYC franchise tax on a consolidated basis. NYC generally conforms its tax law to NYS tax law, and adopted conforming Tax Reform Package provisions similar to those described above for NYS purposes, with only a few minor differences. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, the NYC income tax rate applied to the Company apportioned NYC taxable income is 8.85%.

State of Delaware
 
As a Delaware holding company not conducting business in Delaware, the Holding Company is exempt from Delaware corporate income tax. However, it is required to file an annual report and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware based upon its number of authorized shares.
Regulation
 
General
 
The Bank is a New York State-chartered stock savings bank.  The Bank’s primary regulator is the NYSDFS, and the Bank’s primary federal regulator is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), which regulates and examines state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (“State Nonmember Banks”).  The FDIC also administers laws and regulations applicable to all FDIC-insured depository institutions.  The Holding Company is subject to regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) and, more specifically, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.  The Bank has elected to be treated as a “savings association” under Section 10(l) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended (“HOLA”), for purposes of the regulation of the Holding Company.  The Holding Company is therefore regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the FRB as long as the Bank continues to satisfy the requirements to remain a “qualified thrift lender”  (“QTL”) under HOLA. If the Bank fails to remain a QTL, the Holding Company must register with the FRB, and be treated as, a bank holding company.  The Holding Company does not expect that regulation as a bank holding company rather than a savings and loan holding company would be a significant change.
 
The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”).  The Bank is required to file reports with both the NYSDFS and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and to obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions. Both the NYSDFS and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess the Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a state-chartered savings bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and depositors and generally is not intended for the protection of shareholders, investors or creditors other than insured depositors.  As a publicly-held unitary savings bank holding company, the Holding Company is also required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, both the SEC, under the federal securities laws, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
 
The NYSDFS and the FDIC possess significant discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the NYSDFS, the FDIC or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the operations of either the Bank or Holding Company.
 
The following discussion is intended to be a summary of the material statutes and regulations applicable to NYS chartered savings banks and savings and loan holding companies.  The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations discussed.
 
Regulation of New York State Chartered Savings Banks
 
Business Activities.   The Bank derives its lending, investment, and other authority primarily from the New York Banking Law (“NYBL”) and the regulations of the NYSDFS, subject to limitations under applicable FDIC laws and regulations. Pursuant to the NYBL, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities (including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state, and local governments and agencies), and certain other assets. The lending powers of New York State-chartered savings banks and commercial banks are not generally subject to percentage-of-assets or capital limitations, although there are limits applicable to loans to individual borrowers.  The Bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the Bank, including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage activities.

Recent Financial Regulatory Reforms
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”), which became law in 2010, was intended to address perceived weaknesses in the U.S. financial regulatory system and prevent future economic and financial crises.  The Company believes that the following regulatory reforms, may have an impact on the Company:
 
The Reform Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).  With respect to insured depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, the CFPB has rulemaking, but not enforcement, authority for federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Truth in Savings Act, among others, and may participate in examinations conducted by the federal bank regulatory agencies to determine compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations.
 
In December 2013, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”), FRB, FDIC and SEC (collectively, the “Federal Agencies”) adopted the so-called Volcker Rule to implement the provisions of the Reform Act limiting proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain hedge funds and private equity funds (defined as covered funds in the Volcker Rule).  The covered funds limits are imposed through a conformance period that is expected to end in July 2017.  Management does not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on the operations of either the Bank or Holding Company.
 
In January 2014, the Federal Agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) approved a final rule permitting banking entities to indefinitely retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities (“TRUP CDOs”) that otherwise could not be retained under the covered fund investment prohibitions of the Volcker Rule.  Under the final rule, the agencies permit the retention of an interest in, or sponsorship of, covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are satisfied. As of December 31, 2016, all TRUP CDO investments owned by the Bank satisfied the retention requirements.
 
Basel III Capital Rules
 
On January 1, 2015, the Bank and the Holding Company became subject to a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that was issued by the FDIC and FRB in July 2013 (the “Basel III Capital Rules”), subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions.
 
The Basel III Capital Rules provide for the following minimum capital to risk-weighted assets ratios as of January 1, 2015: a) 4.5% based upon common equity tier 1 capital (“CET1”); b) 6.0% based upon tier 1 capital; and c) 8.0% based upon total regulatory capital.  A minimum leverage ratio (tier 1 capital as a percentage of average consolidated assets) of 4.0% is also required under the Basel III Capital Rules.  When fully phased in, the Basel III Capital Rules will additionally require institutions to retain a capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of CET1, of 2.5% above these required minimum capital ratio levels.  Banking organizations that fail to maintain the minimum 2.5% capital conservation buffer could face restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.  Restrictions would begin phasing in where the banking organization’s capital conservation buffer was below 2.5% at the beginning of a quarter, and distributions and discretionary bonus payments would be completely prohibited if no capital conservation buffer exists.  When the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Holding Company and the Bank will effectively have the following minimum capital to risk-weighted assets ratios: a) 7.0% based upon CET1; b) 8.5% based upon tier 1 capital; and c) 10.5% based upon total regulatory capital.
 
The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from, and adjustments to, CET1.  These include, for example, the requirement that MSR, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1.
 
 F-14
 

Implementation of the deductions from, and other adjustments to, CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and are being phased-in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and will increase by 0.625% each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  The Basel III Capital Rules also revised the definitions and components of regulatory capital, and addressed other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios.  The Basel III Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios.
 
With respect to the Bank, the Basel III Capital Rules revise the “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) regulations adopted pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) by: (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8.0% (as compared to the current 6.0%); and (iii) eliminating the provision that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3.0% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The Basel III Capital Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category.
 
The Basel III Capital Rules increased the required capital levels of the Bank and subjected the Holding Company to consolidated capital rules. The Bank and Company made the one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items included in stockholders’ equity for the purposes of determining the regulatory capital ratios.  See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of regulatory matters.
 
FDIC Guidance on Managing Market Risk
 
In October 2013, the FDIC published guidance entitled “Managing Sensitivity to Market Risk in a Challenging Interest Rate Environment”.  This guidance notes the FDIC’s ongoing supervisory concern that certain institutions may be insufficiently prepared or positioned for sustained increases in, or volatility of, interest rates.  The guidance emphasizes a series of best practices to ensure that state nonmember institutions, such as the Bank, have adopted a comprehensive asset-liability and interest rate risk management process.  These practices include:  (i) effective board governance and oversight; (ii) a sound policy framework and prudent exposure limits; (iii) well-developed risk measurement tools for effective measurement and monitoring of interest rate risk and; (iv) effective risk mitigation strategies.  The Bank has implemented the best practices as of December 31, 2016.
FDIC Real Estate Lending Standards
 
FDIC regulations prescribe standards for extensions of credit that (i) are secured by liens on or interests in real estate, or (ii) are made for the purpose of financing construction or improvements on real estate.  FDIC regulations require nonmember banks to establish and maintain written real estate lending policies that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its real estate lending activities.  The policies must also be consistent with accompanying interagency guidelines, which include loan-to-value limitations for different types of real estate loans.  Under certain circumstances, institutions are also permitted to make a limited amount of loans that do not conform to the loan-to-value limitations.  In addition, the federal banking agencies consider as part of their ongoing supervisory monitoring processes whether an institution is exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk.  Institutions that (i) have experienced rapid growth in their commercial real estate lending, (ii) have notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate or (iii) are approaching or have exceeded the following concentration thresholds may become subject to additional regulatory review: (a) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 percent or more of the institution’s total capital; or (b) total commercial real estate loans, excluding owner occupied properties, represent 300 percent or more of the institution’s total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 percent or more during the prior 36 months.

NYSDFS Guidelines for Bank Lending to Multifamily Properties Under the Community Reinvestment Act
 
Under the NYSDFS’ September 2013 guidelines addressing responsible multifamily lending, the NYSDFS’ Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) examinations review whether a bank has satisfied its responsibility to ensure that any loan contributes to, and does not undermine, the availability of affordable housing or neighborhood conditions.  Under the guidelines, a loan on a multifamily property would not be found to have a community development purpose, and would not be CRA eligible if it:  (i) significantly reduces or has the potential to reduce affordable housing; (ii) facilitates substandard living conditions; (iii) is in technical default; or (iv) has been underwritten in an unsound manner.
 
The guidelines also recommend that banks consider adopting a series of best practices in an effort to help avoid reductions in qualitative or quantitative CRA credit on multifamily loans.
 
Implementation of these guidelines has not materially impacted the business and operations of the Bank.
 
Limitations on Individual Loans and Aggregate Loans to One Borrower
 
As an NYS-chartered savings bank originating loans secured by real estate having a market value at least equal to the loan amount at the time of origination, the Bank is generally not constrained by NYSDFS regulations limiting individual loan or borrower exposures.
 
QTL Test
 
In order for the Holding Company to be regulated by the FRB as a savings and loan holding company rather than a bank holding company, the Bank must remain a QTL. To satisfy this requirement, the Bank must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in certain “qualified thrift investments” during at least nine of the most recent twelve months. “Portfolio assets” mean, in general, the Bank’s total assets less the sum of: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (ii) certain intangibles, including goodwill, credit card relationships and purchased MSR, and (iii) the value of property used to conduct the Bank’s business. “Qualified thrift investments” include various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes; investments related to such purposes, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities; and small business, education, and credit card loans.  At December 31, 2016, the Bank maintained 78.2% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments. The Bank also satisfied the QTL test in each month during 2016, and, therefore, was a QTL.  If the Bank fails to remain a QTL, the Holding Company must register with the FRB as a bank holding company. While the Holding Company intends to remain a savings and loan holding company, regulation as a bank holding company rather than a savings and loan holding company would not be expected to have a material impact upon its financial condition or results of operations.
 
A savings association that fails the QTL test will generally be prohibited from (i) engaging in any new activity not permissible for a national bank, (ii) paying dividends, unless the payment would be permissible for a national bank, is necessary to meet obligations of a company that controls the savings bank, and is specifically approved by the FDIC and the FRB, and (iii) establishing any new branch office in a location not permissible for a national bank in the association’s home state.  A savings association that fails to satisfy the QTL test may be subject to FDIC enforcement action.  In addition, within one year of the date a savings association ceases to satisfy the QTL test, any company controlling the association must register under, and become subject to the requirements of, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”).  A savings association that has failed the QTL test may requalify under the QTL test and be relieved of the limitations; however, it may do so only once.  If the savings association does not requalify under the QTL test within three years after failing the QTL test, it will be required to terminate any activity, and dispose of any investment, not permissible for a national bank.  These provisions remain in effect under the Reform Act.

Advisory on Interest Rate Risk Management
 
In January 2010, the Agencies released an Advisory on Interest Rate Risk Management (the “IRR Advisory”) to remind institutions of the supervisory expectations regarding sound practices for managing IRR.  While some degree of IRR is inherent in the business of banking, the Agencies expect institutions to have sound risk management practices in place to measure, monitor and control IRR exposures, and IRR management should be an integral component of an institution’s risk management infrastructure.  The Agencies expect all institutions to manage their IRR exposures using processes and systems commensurate with their earnings and capital levels, complexity, business model, risk profile and scope of operations.  The IRR Advisory further reiterates the importance of effective corporate governance, policies and procedures, risk measuring and monitoring systems, stress testing, and internal controls related to the IRR exposures of institutions.
 
The IRR Advisory encourages institutions to use a variety of techniques to measure IRR exposure, which include simple maturity gap analysis, income measurement and valuation measurement for assessing the impact of changes in market rates as well as simulation modeling to measure IRR exposure.  Institutions are encouraged to use the full complement of analytical capabilities of their IRR simulation models.  The IRR Advisory also reminds institutions that stress testing, which includes both scenario and sensitivity analysis, is an integral component of IRR management.  The IRR Advisory indicates that institutions should regularly assess IRR exposures beyond typical industry conventions, including changes in rates of greater magnitude (e.g., up and down 300 and 400 basis points as compared to the generally used up and down 200 basis points) across different tenors to reflect changing slopes and twists of the yield curve.
 
The IRR Advisory emphasizes that effective IRR management not only involves the identification and measurement of IRR, but also provides for appropriate actions to control the risk.  The adequacy and effectiveness of an institution’s IRR management process and the level of its IRR exposure are critical factors in the Agencies’ evaluation of an institution’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates and capital adequacy.
 
Limitation on Capital Distributions
 
The NYBL and the New York banking regulations, as well as FDIC and FRB regulations impose limitations upon capital distributions by state-chartered savings banks, such as cash dividends, payments to purchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger, and other distributions charged against capital.
 
Under the NYBL and the New York banking regulations, New York State-chartered stock savings banks may declare and pay dividends out of net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital, however, approval of the New York State Superintendent of Financial Services (“Superintendent”) is required if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less prior dividends paid.
 
As the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, the Bank is required to file a notice with the FRB at least 30 days prior to each capital distribution.  The FRB can prohibit a proposed capital distribution if it determines that the bank would be “undercapitalized”, as defined in the FDIA, following the distribution or that a proposed distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Further, under FDIC PCA regulations, the Bank would be prohibited from making a capital distribution if, after the distribution, the Bank would fail to satisfy its minimum capital requirements, as described above (See “PCA”).
 
Liquidity
 
Pursuant to FDIC regulations, the Bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation.
 
 F-17
 

Assessments
 
New York State-chartered savings banks are required by the NYBL to pay annual assessments to the NYSDFS in connection with its regulation and supervision (including examination) of the Bank.  This annual assessment is based primarily on the asset size of the Bank, among other factors determined by the NYSDFS.  The Bank is not required to pay additional assessments to the FDIC for its regulation and supervision (including examination) of the Bank as a State Nonmember Bank, however, the Bank is required to pay assessments to the FDIC as an insured depository institution.  (See “Insurance of Deposit Accounts”).
Branching
 
Subject to certain limitations, NYS and federal law permit NYS-chartered savings banks to establish branches in any state of the United States.  In general, federal law allows the FDIC, and the NYBL allows the Superintendent, to approve an application by a state banking institution to acquire interstate branches by merger.  The NYBL authorizes New York State-chartered savings banks to open and occupy de novo branches outside the State of New York. Pursuant to the Reform Act, the FDIC is authorized to approve the establishment by a state bank of a de novo interstate branch if the intended host state allows de novo branching within that state by banks chartered by that state.
 
Community Reinvestment
 
Under the CRA, as implemented by FDIC regulations, an insured depository institution possesses a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help satisfy the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services it believes are most appropriate to its particular community. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a State Nonmember Bank, to assess the bank’s record of satisfying the credit needs of its community and consider such record in its evaluation of certain applications by the bank.  The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. The Bank received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent examination.   Regulations additionally require that the Bank publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of the CRA.  The Bank has no such agreements.
 
The Bank is also subject to provisions of the NYBL that impose continuing and affirmative obligations upon a New York State-chartered savings bank to serve the credit needs of its local community (the “NYCRA”).  Such obligations are substantially similar to those imposed by the CRA.  The NYCRA requires the NYSDFS to make a periodic written assessment of an institution’s compliance with the NYCRA, utilizing a four-tiered rating system, and to make such assessment available to the public.  The NYCRA also requires the Superintendent to consider the NYCRA rating when reviewing an application to engage in certain transactions, including mergers, asset purchases and the establishment of branch offices or ATMs, and provides that such assessment may serve as a basis for the denial of any such application.  The Bank became subject to the NYCRA at the Charter Conversion, and has not yet received a NYCRA rating.
 
Transactions with Related Parties
 
The Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its “affiliates” is limited by FDIC regulations, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (“FRA”), and Regulation W issued by the FRB.  FDIC regulations regarding transactions with affiliates generally conform to Regulation W.  These provisions, among other matters, prohibit, limit or place restrictions upon a depository institution extending credit to, purchasing assets from, or entering into certain transactions (including securities lending, repurchase agreements and derivatives activities) with, its affiliates, which, for the Bank, would include the Holding Company and any other subsidiary of the Holding Company.
 
As a “savings association” under Section 10(l) of the HOLA, the Bank is additionally subject to the rules governing transactions with affiliates for savings associations under HOLA Section 11.  These rules prohibit, subject to certain exemptions, a savings association from: (i) advancing a loan to an affiliate engaged in non-bank holding company activities; and (ii) purchasing or investing in securities issued by an affiliate that is not a subsidiary.
 
 F-18
 

The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers, and stockholders owning 10% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is additionally governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and Regulation O of the FRB enacted thereunder. Among other matters, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders: (i) be made on terms substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and (ii) not exceed certain amount limitations individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital. Regulation O additionally requires that extensions of credit in excess of certain limits be approved in advance by the bank’s board of directors.
 
New York banking regulations impose certain limits and requirements on various transactions with “insiders,” as defined in the New York banking regulations to include certain executive officers, directors and principal stockholders.
 
The Holding Company and Bank both presently prohibit loans to directors and executive management.
 
Enforcement
 
Under the NYBL, the Superintendent possesses enforcement power over New York State-chartered savings banks.  The NYBL gives the Superintendent authority to order a New York State-chartered savings bank to appear and explain an apparent violation of law, to discontinue unauthorized or unsafe practices and to maintain prescribed books and accounts.  Upon a finding by the Superintendent that a director, trustee or officer of a savings bank has violated any law, or has continued unauthorized or unsafe practices in conducting its business after having been notified by the Superintendent to discontinue such practices, such director, trustee, or officer may be removed from office after notice and an opportunity to be heard.  The Superintendent also has authority to appoint a conservator or receiver, such as the FDIC, for a savings bank under certain circumstances.
 
Under the FDIA, the FDIC possesses enforcement authority for FDIC insured depository institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action, including civil monetary penalties, against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including any controlling stockholder or any shareholder, attorney, appraiser or accountant who knowingly or recklessly participates in any violation of applicable law or regulation, breach of fiduciary duty or certain other wrongful actions that cause, or are likely to cause, more than minimal loss to or other significant adverse effect on an insured depository institution. Under HOLA and the FDIA, the FRB possesses similar authority to bring enforcement actions and impose civil monetary penalties against savings and loan holding companies for violations of applicable law or regulation.  In addition, regulators possess substantial discretion to take enforcement action against an institution that fails to comply with the law, particularly with respect to capital requirements. Possible enforcement actions range from informal enforcement actions, such as a memorandum of understanding, to formal enforcement actions, such as a written agreement, cease and desist order or civil money penalty, the imposition of a capital plan and capital directive to receivership, conservatorship, or the termination of deposit insurance.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness
 
Pursuant to FDICIA, as amended by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, the FDIC, together with the other federal bank regulatory agencies, has adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other features, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder.  In addition, the FDIC has adopted regulations pursuant to FDICIA that authorize, but do not require, the FDIC to order an institution that has been given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so ordered, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized bank is subject under the PCA provisions of FDICIA (See "Part I - Item 1 – Business - Regulation - Regulation of New York State Chartered Savings Banks –PCA").  If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek enforcement in judicial proceedings and the imposition of civil money penalties.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts
 
The standard maximum amount of FDIC deposit insurance is $250,000 per depositor.  Insured depository institutions are required to pay quarterly deposit insurance assessments to the DIF.  Assessments are based on average total assets minus average tangible equity.  The assessment rate is determined through a risk-based system.  For depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, the FDIC assigns an institution to one of four risk categories based on its safety and soundness supervisory ratings (its "CAMELS” ratings) and its capital levels.  The initial base assessment rate depends on the institution’s risk category, as well as, if it is in the highest category (indicating the lowest risk), certain financial measures.  The initial base assessment rate currently ranges from 3 to 30 basis points on an annualized basis.  After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from 1.5 to 40 basis points on an annualized basis.
 
As a result of the recent failures of a number of banks and thrifts, there has been a significant increase in the loss provisions of the DIF.  This resulted in a decline in the DIF reserve ratio during 2008 below the then minimum designated reserve ratio of 1.15%.  In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Reform Act.  In March 2016, the FDIC adopted a final rule increasing the reserve ratio for the DIF to 1.35% of total insured deposits.  The rule imposes a surcharge on the assessments of depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets beginning the third quarter of 2016 and continuing through the earlier of the quarter that the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35% and December 31, 2018.  As a depository institution with less than $10 billion in assets, this rule will not apply to the Bank. The FDIC has established a long-term target for the reserve ratio of 2.0%. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking if required.
 
In addition, the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 authorized the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) to impose assessments on DIF applicable deposits in order to service the interest on FICO’s bond obligations from deposit insurance fund assessments.  The amount assessed on individual institutions by FICO is in addition to the amount, if any, paid for deposit insurance according to the FDIC’s risk-related assessment rate schedules.  FICO assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect a change in assessment base.  These payments approximate 10% of the Bank's annual FDIC insurance payments and will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017 through 2019.
 
Acquisitions
 
Under the federal Bank Merger Act, prior approval of the FDIC is required for the Bank to merge with or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another insured depository institution. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the FDIC will consider, among other factors, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the CRA (see “Community Reinvestment”) and its compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.
Privacy and Security Protection
 
The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations for consumer privacy protection that require financial institutions to adopt procedures to protect customers and their "non-public personal information."  The regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares "non-public personal information," to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship, and annually thereafter if there are changes to its policy.  In addition, the Bank is required to provide its customers the ability to "opt-out" of:  (1) the sharing of their personal information with unaffiliated third parties if the sharing of such information does not satisfy any of the permitted exceptions; and (2) the receipt of marketing solicitations from Bank affiliates.

The Bank is additionally subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information.  The guidelines describe the federal banking agencies' expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, including administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities.  The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, and protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial customer harm or inconvenience.
 
Federal law additionally permits each state to enact legislation that is more protective of consumers' personal information.  Currently, there are a number of privacy bills pending in the New York legislature.  Management of the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of these bills if enacted.
 
Cybersecurity more broadly has become a focus of federal and state regulators.  In March 2015, federal regulators issued two statements regarding cybersecurity to reiterate regulatory expectations regarding cyberattacks compromising credentials and business continuity planning to ensure the rapid recovery of an institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware.  In October 2016, federal regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision. Once established, the enhanced cyber risk management standards would help to reduce the potential impact of a cyber-attack or other cyber-related failure on the financial system.  The advance notice of proposed rulemaking addresses five categories of cyber standards: (1) cyber risk governance; (2) cyber risk management; (3) internal dependency management; (4) external dependency management; and (5) incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness.  In December 2016, the NYSDFS re-proposed regulations that would require financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including the Bank, to, among other things, (i) establish and maintain a cyber security program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cyber security policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information; and (iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer.  The Company will continue to monitor any developments related to these proposed rulemakings as part of its ongoing cyber risk management.  See "Item 1A - Risk Factors" for a further discussion of cybersecurity risks.
 
Consumer Protection and Compliance Provisions
 
The Bank is subject to various consumer protection laws and regulations. The Bank may be subject to potential liability for material violations of these laws and regulations, in the form of litigation by governmental and consumer groups, the FDIC and other federal regulatory agencies including the Department of Justice. Moreover, the CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all depository institutions, as well as the authority to prohibit "unfair, deceptive or abusive" acts and practices.
Insurance Activities
 
As a New York State chartered savings bank, the Bank is generally permitted to engage in certain insurance activities: (i) directly in places where the population does not exceed 5,000 persons, or (ii) in places with larger populations through subsidiaries if certain conditions are satisfied.  Federal agency regulations prohibit depository institutions from conditioning the extension of credit to individuals upon either the purchase of an insurance product or annuity or an agreement by the consumer not to purchase an insurance product or annuity from an entity not affiliated with the depository institution.  The regulations additionally require prior disclosure of this prohibition if such products are offered to credit applicants. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material impact upon the Bank's financial condition or results of operations.
Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") System
 
The Bank is a member of the FHLBNY, which is one of the twelve regional FHLBs composing the FHLB System. Each FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions. Any advances from the FHLBNY must be secured by specified types of collateral, and long-term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance.  The Bank, as a member of the FHLBNY, is currently required to acquire and hold shares of FHLBNY Class B stock as a membership requirement and must hold additional stock based on its FHLB borrowing and certain other activities.  The Bank was in compliance with these requirements with an investment in FHLBNY Class B stock of $44.4 million at December 31, 2016.  The FHLBNY can adjust the specific percentages and dollar amount periodically within the ranges established by the FHLBNY capital plan.

Federal Reserve System
 
The Bank is subject to FRA and FRB regulations requiring state-chartered depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts).  Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash, a low-interest-bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank, or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank's interest-earning assets. The balances maintained to satisfy the FRB reserve requirements may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the FDIC.
 
The Federal Reserve Banks pay interest on depository institutions’ required and excess reserve balances.  The interest rate paid on required reserve balances and excess balances is currently 0.75 percent.
 
Depository institutions are additionally authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve ''discount window,'' however, FRB regulations require such institutions to hold reserves in the form of vault cash or deposits with Federal Reserve Banks in order to borrow.
 
Anti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification
 
Financial institutions are subject to Bank Secrecy Act amendments and specific federal agency guidance in relation to implementing the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 ("PATRIOT Act").  The PATRIOT Act provides the federal government with powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements.  By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the PATRIOT Act enacted measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies. In addition, certain provisions of Title III and the FDIC guidance impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks and thrifts.  Title III imposes the following requirements, among others, with respect to financial institutions: (i) establishment of anti-money laundering programs; (ii) establishment of procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers opening new accounts, including verifying their identity within a reasonable period of time; (iii) establishment of enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering; and (iv)  prohibition on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with recordkeeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks. In addition, the NYSDFS issued a final regulation in June 2016 that sets forth, for financial institutions chartered or licensed under the New York Banking Law, the attributes of certain compliance programs such institutions must have to ensure compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering laws and regulations and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”).  The regulation requires the board of directors or a senior officer of an institution to make an annual finding as to an institution’s compliance with the requirements of the regulation.
 
Finally, bank regulators are directed to consider an organization’s effectiveness in preventing money laundering when reviewing and acting on regulatory applications.
 
OFAC Regulation
 
OFAC, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals, and others.  Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.

Regulation of the Holding Company
 
The Bank has made an election under Section 10(l) of the HOLA to be treated as a “savings association” for purposes of regulation of the Holding Company. As a result, the Holding Company continues, after the Charter Conversion, to be registered with the FRB as a non-diversified unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the HOLA.  The Holding Company is currently subject to FRB regulations, examination, enforcement and supervision, as well as reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary depository institution.  In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over the Holding Company’s non-depository institution subsidiaries.  If the Bank does not continue to satisfy the QTL test, the Holding Company must change its status with the FRB as a savings and loan holding company and register as a bank holding company under the BHCA.  (See "Regulation of New York State-Chartered Savings Banks–QTL Test").
 
HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring another savings association or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the FRB; acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary savings association, non-subsidiary holding company, or non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by HOLA; or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating an application by a holding company to acquire a savings association, the FRB must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and savings association involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community, and competitive factors.
 
The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999 (“Gramm-Leach”) additionally restricts the powers of certain unitary savings and loan holding companies.  A unitary savings and loan holding company that is "grandfathered," i.e., became a unitary savings and loan holding company pursuant to an application filed with the Office of Thrift Supervision (the regulator of savings and loan holding companies prior to the FRB) prior to May 4, 1999, such as the Holding Company, retains the authority it possessed under the law in existence as of May 4, 1999.  All other savings and loan holding companies are limited to financially related activities permissible for bank holding companies, as defined under Gramm-Leach.  Gramm-Leach also prohibits non-financial companies from acquiring grandfathered savings and loan holding companies.
 
Upon any non-supervisory acquisition by the Holding Company of another savings association or a savings bank that satisfies the QTL test and is deemed to be a savings association and that will be held as a separate subsidiary, the Holding Company will become a multiple savings and loan holding company and will be subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which it may engage.  HOLA limits the activities of a multiple savings and loan holding company and its non-insured subsidiaries primarily to activities permissible under Section 4(c) of the BHCA, subject to prior approval of the FRB, or the activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the BHCA, if the company meets the requirements to be treated as a financial holding company, and to other activities authorized by federal agency regulations.
 
Federal agency regulations prohibit regulatory approval of any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings associations in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: an acquisition of a savings association in another state (i) in a supervisory transaction, or (ii) pursuant to authority under the laws of the state of the association to be acquired that specifically permit such acquisitions.  The conditions imposed upon interstate acquisitions by those states that have enacted authorizing legislation vary.
 
The Bank must file a notice with the FRB prior to the payment of any dividends or other capital distributions to the Holding Company (See "Regulation-Regulation of New York State Chartered Savings Banks - Limitation on Capital Distributions'').  The FRB has the authority to deny such payment request.

Restrictions on the Acquisition of the Holding Company
 
Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act ("CIBCA") and implementing regulations, a notice must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10% or more of the shares of outstanding Common Stock, unless the FRB has found that the acquisition will not result in a change in control of the Holding Company. Under CIBCA and implementing regulations, the FRB generally has 60 days within which to act on such notices, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer; the convenience and needs of the communities served by the Holding Company, the Bank; and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Under HOLA, any company would be required to obtain approval from the FRB before it may obtain "control" of the Holding Company within the meaning of HOLA. Control is generally defined to mean the ownership or power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Holding Company or the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the Holding Company’s directors, although a person or entity may also be determined to “control” the Holding Company without satisfying these requirements if it is determined that he, she or it directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the Holding Company. In addition, an existing bank holding company or savings and loan holding company would, under federal banking laws and regulations, generally be required to obtain FRB approval before acquiring more than 5% of the Holding Company’s voting stock.
 
In addition to the applicable federal laws and regulations, New York State Banking Law generally requires prior approval of the New York State Superintendent of Financial Services before any action is taken that causes any company to acquire direct or indirect control of a banking institution organized in New York.
 
Federal Securities Laws
 
The Common Stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  It is subject to the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act.
Delaware Corporation Law
 
The Holding Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and, therefore, is subject to regulation by the State of Delaware, and the rights of its shareholders are governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
