Item 1.  Description of Business.
Business Development.
 
Organization and Charter Amendments.
 
     Oranco,  Inc., (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, on June 10, 1977. The purposes for which the corporation was organized were: (1) to engage in any lawful business from time to time authorized by the board of directors, (2) to act as principal, agent, partner or joint venturer or in any other capacity in any transaction, (3) to do business anywhere in the world, and (4) to have and exercise all rights and powers from time to time granted to the corporation by law. From 1977 until 1981 the Company was dormant and undertook no activities. Beginning in 1982 the Company explored the option of entering into a joint venture to develop a mercury mining property at Mercury Mountain, Nevada. As a part of these activities the Company, through the sale of its common stock, raised funds to engage the services of an independent mining engineer to prepare a report on the feasibility of the project. By late 1983 it had been determined that the project did not warrant any further investment. From that time until 1997 the Company's activities concentrated on maintaining its corporate existence and looking for other opportunities for the Company. In May of 1997 new management was appointed, a shareholders' meeting was held, amendments to the Company's articles of incorporation were approved, and additional effort was made by new management to make the Company a viable merger candidate. These efforts included engaging the services of a certified Public Accounting firm to audit the Company's financial statements, obtaining an Opinion of Counsel as to the tradability of the Company's outstanding shares, preparation of the information required by Rule 15c2-11, and applying to the OTC Bulletin Board for trading on the medium.
 
    By September of 1999, no viable acquisitions or merger candidates had been located for the Company and management became aware that the Company would be required to register its shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in order to maintain its stock on the OTC Bulletin Board. Management determined that the Company needed new management which might be better positioned to find a suitable acquisition or merger candidate and which would be in a position of funding the upcoming expenses of the Company. On September 1, 1999 management of the Company resigned and Claudio Gianascio was appointed as sole director and officer. On November 9, 1999 the Company sold 700,000 of its common stock to Mr. Gianascio for $.05 per share, netting a total of $35,000. On November 18, 1999 the Company filed a registration statement on Form 10SB which became effective sixty days thereafter.
 
     The Company had an initial authorized  capital of $25,000  consisting  of 100,000 shares of $.25 par value common stock. On June 10, 1997 the shareholders approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of The Company changing the authorized capital to 100,000,000 shares at a par value of $.001 and providing for a 10 to 1 share forward split of the outstanding shares. The Articles of Amendment were filed with the State of Nevada on August 6, 1998.
 
     In the summer of 2000, the Company completed a private placement of 2,500,000 units for which it received $250,000 Each unit consisted of one share of common stock; one "a" warrant giving the holder thereof the right to purchase, upon a minimum of 60 days prior notice of exercise, one share of common stock at $.10 per share within two years of the date of issuance; and one "b" warrant giving the holder thereof the right to purchase, upon a minimum of 60 days prior notice of exercise, one share of common stock at $.25 per share within two years of the date of issuance. Both "a" & "b" warrants expired without exercise.

Business.
 
     Other than the  above-referenced  matters  and  seeking  and  investigating potential  assets,  properties or businesses to acquire,  the Company has had no business  operations  since  inception. To provide revenue on an interim basis, the Company has held its funds in interest bearing bank accounts, made short term loans to reputable unaffiliated corporations, and funded the pursuit of one lawsuit.
 
     To the extent that the  Company  intends to continue  to seek the  acquisition  of assets,  property  or  business  that may benefit the Company and its  stockholders,  it is  essentially  a "blank  check" company.  Because  the  Company has  limited  assets and  conducts no  business, management  anticipates  that any such  acquisition  would  require  it to issue shares of its common stock as the sole  consideration for the acquisition.  This may result in substantial  dilution of the shares of current  stockholders.  The Company's  Board of  Directors  shall  make the final  determination  whether to complete any such  acquisition;  the approval of stockholders will not be sought unless  required by  applicable  laws,  rules and  regulations,  its Articles of Incorporation  or Bylaws,  or contract.  The Company makes no assurance that any future enterprise will be profitable or successful.
 
     The Company is not currently engaging in any substantive business activity and has no plans to engage in any such activity in the foreseeable future.  In its present form, the Company may be deemed to be a vehicle to acquire or merge with a business or company.  The Company does not intend to restrict its search to any particular business or industry, and the areas in which it will seek out acquisitions,  reorganizations  or mergers may include,  but will not be limited to, the fields of high technology,  manufacturing,  natural resources,  service, research and development, communications,  transportation, insurance, brokerage, finance and all medically related fields,  among others.  The Company recognizes that the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to it may be extremely limited, and may be restricted to entities who desire to avoid what these entities may deem to be the adverse factors related to an initial public offering ("IPO").  The most prevalent of these factors include substantial time requirements, legal and accounting costs, the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to publicly offer and sell shares, the lack of or the inability to obtain the  required financial  statements  for such an undertaking,  limitations  on the  amount of  dilution  to public  investors  in comparison to the stockholders of any such entities, along with other conditions or requirements  imposed by various federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations.  Any of these types of entities,  regardless of their  prospects, would require the Company to issue a substantial  number of shares of its common stock to  complete  any such  acquisition,  reorganization  or  merger,  usually amounting to between 80 and 95 percent of the outstanding shares of the Company following the completion of any such transaction;  accordingly,  investments in any such private  entity,  if available,  would be much more  favorable than any investment in the Company.
 
     In the event that the Company engages in any transaction resulting in a change of control of the Company  and/or the  acquisition  of a  business,  the Company will be required to file with the Commission  a Current  Report on Form 8-K within the time periods provided for.  A filing on Form 8-K also requires the filing of audited financial statements of the business acquired, as well as pro forma financial information  consisting of a pro forma condensed balance sheet, pro forma statements of income and accompanying explanatory notes.
 
     Management intends to consider a number of factors  prior to making any decision as to whether to participate in any specific business endeavor, none of which may be determinative  or provide  any  assurance  of  success.  These
 may include, but will not be limited to an analysis of the quality of the entity's management  personnel;  the  anticipated  acceptability  of any new  products or marketing concepts;  the merit of technological  changes;  its present financial condition,  projected  growth potential and available  technical,  financial and managerial  resources;  its working  capital,  history of operations  and future prospects;  the nature of its present and expected competition;  the quality and experience  of its  management  services  and the depth of its  management;  its potential  for  further  research,  development  or  exploration;  risk  factors specifically  related to its  business  operations;  its  potential  for growth, expansion and profit;  the  perceived  public  recognition  or acceptance of its products,  services,  trademarks  and name  identification;  and numerous  other factors  which are  difficult,  if not  impossible,  to properly  or  accurately analyze, let alone describe or identify, without referring to specific objective criteria.

     Regardless, the results of operations of any specific entity may not necessarily be indicative of what may occur in the future, by reason of changing market  strategies,  plant or product  expansion,  changes in product  emphasis, future management  personnel and changes in innumerable other factors.  Further, in the case of a new  business  venture  or one  that  is in a  research  and development mode, the risks will be substantial,  and there will be no objective criteria to examine the  effectiveness or the abilities of its management or its business  objectives.  Also, a firm market for its products or services may yet need to be established, and with no past track record, the profitability of any such entity will be unproven and cannot be predicted with any certainty.
 
     Management  will  attempt  to  meet  personally  with  management  and  key personnel  of the entity  sponsoring  any business  opportunity  afforded to the Company,  visit and inspect material facilities,  obtain independent analysis or verification  of  information   provided  and  gathered,   check  references  of management  and key  personnel  and conduct other  reasonably  prudent  measures calculated to ensure a reasonably  thorough  review of any  particular  business opportunity;  however,  due to time constraints of management,  these activities may be limited.
 
     The Company is unable to predict the time as to when and if it may actually participate in any specific  business  endeavor.  The Company  anticipates  that proposed  business  ventures  will  be made  available  to it  through  personal contacts  of  directors,   executive   officers  and   principal   stockholders, professional advisors, broker dealers in securities,  venture capital personnel, members  of the  financial  community  and others  who may  present  unsolicited proposals.  In certain cases,  the Company may agree to pay a finder's fee or to otherwise  compensate  the persons who submit a potential  business  endeavor in which  the  Company  eventually  participates.  Such persons  may  include  the Company's directors,  executive officers, beneficial owners or their affiliates. In this  event,  such  fees may  become a factor  in  negotiations  regarding  a potential acquisition and,  accordingly,  may present a conflict of interest for such individuals.

     Although the Company has not identified any potential  acquisition  target, the possibility  exists that the Company may acquire or merge with a business or company in which the Company's executive officers, directors,  beneficial owners or their affiliates may have an ownership interest.  Current Company policy does not prohibit such  transactions.  Because no such transaction is currently contemplated, it is impossible to estimate the potential  pecuniary benefits to these persons.
 
     Further, substantial fees are often paid in connection with the completion of these types of acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers, ranging from a small amount to as much as $250,000. These fees are usually divided among promoters or founders,  after deduction of legal,  accounting and other related expenses, and it is not  unusual  for a  portion  of  these  fees  to be paid  to  members  of management or to principal  stockholders as consideration for their agreement to retire a portion of the shares of common stock owned by them.  In the event that such fees are paid,  they may  become a factor in  negotiations  regarding  any potential acquisition by the Company and, accordingly, may present a conflict of interest for such individuals.
 
Principal Products and Services.
 
   The limited  business  operations  of the  Company,  as now  contemplated, involve those of a "blank check" company. The only activities to be conducted by the  Company  are to  manage  its  current  limited  assets  and to seek out and investigate the  acquisition of any viable business  opportunity by purchase and exchange for securities of the Company or pursuant to a reorganization or merger through which securities of the Company will be issued or exchanged.

Distribution Methods of the Products or Services.
 
     Management will seek out and  investigate  business  opportunities  through every reasonably available fashion, including personal contacts,  professionals, securities broker dealers,  venture capital personnel,  members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals; the Company may also advertise its  availability as a vehicle to bring a company to the public market through a "reverse" reorganization or merger.
 
Status of any Publicly Announced New Product or Service.
 
     None; not applicable.
 
Competitive Business Conditions.
 
     Management  believes  that there are  literally  thousands of "blank check" companies engaged in endeavors similar to those engaged in by the Company;  many of  these  companies  have   substantial current  assets  and  cash  reserves. Competitors  also  include  thousands  of other  publicly-held  companies  whose business  operations  have proven  unsuccessful,  and whose only viable business opportunity is that of providing a publicly-held vehicle through which a private entity may have access to the public capital markets. There is no reasonable way to predict the  competitive  position of the Company or any other  entity in the strata of these endeavors;  however, the Company, having limited assets and cash reserves,  will no doubt be at a  competitive  disadvantage  in  competing  with entities which have recently  completed  IPO's,  have significant cash resources and have recent operating  histories when compared with the complete lack of any substantive operations by the Company for the past several years.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Names of Principal Suppliers.
 
     None; not applicable.
 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers.
 
     None; not applicable.
 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts.
 
     None; not applicable.
 
Need for any Governmental Approval of Principal Products or Services.
 
     Because the Company currently produces no products or services, it is not presently subject to any governmental
 regulation in this regard. However, in the event that the Company  engages in a merger or acquisition  transaction  with an entity  that  engages  in  such  activities,  it  will  become  subject  to  all governmental  approval  requirements to
 which the merged or acquired  entity is subject.
 
Research and Development.
 
  None; not applicable.

Cost and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws.
 
    None; not applicable.  However,  environmental  laws, rules and regulations may have an adverse  effect on any business  venture viewed by the Company as an attractive  acquisition,  reorganization or merger candidate,  and these factors may further  limit the number of potential  candidates  available to the Company for acquisition, reorganization or merger.
Number of Employees.
 
     None.
