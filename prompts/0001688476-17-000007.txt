Our Company
We are one of the largest pure-play providers of integrated well completion services in the U.S., with a focus on complex, technically demanding completion solutions. Our primary service offerings include horizontal and vertical fracturing, wireline perforation and logging and engineered solutions, as well as other value-added service offerings. With approximately 944,250 hydraulic horsepower spread across 23 hydraulic fracturing fleets and 23 wireline trucks located in the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the SCOOP/STACK Formation, the Bakken Formation and other active oil and gas basins, we provide industry-leading completion services with a strict focus on health, safety and environmental stewardship and cost-effective customer-centric solutions. Our company prides itself on our outstanding employee culture, our efficiency and our ability to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers and communities in which we operate.
 We provide our services in conjunction with onshore well development, in addition to stimulation operations on existing wells, to exploration and production (“E&P”) customers with some of the highest quality and safety standards in the industry. We believe our proven capabilities enable us to deliver cost-effective solutions for increasingly complex and technically demanding well completion requirements, which include longer lateral segments, higher pressure rates and proppant intensity, and multiple fracturing stages in challenging high-pressure formations. 
We operate in the most active unconventional oil and natural gas basins in the U.S., including the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the SCOOP/STACK Formation and the Bakken Formation. We are one of the largest providers of hydraulic fracturing services in the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale and the Bakken Formation by total hydraulic horsepower deployed. 
 Our completion services are designed in partnership with our customers to enhance both initial production rates and estimated ultimate recovery from new and existing wells. We seek to deploy our assets with well-capitalized customers that have long-term development programs that enable us to maximize operational efficiencies and the return on our assets. We believe our integrated approach increases efficiencies and provides potential cost savings for our customers, allowing us to broaden our relationships with existing customers and attract new ones. In addition, our technical team and engineering center, which is located in The Woodlands, Texas, provides us the ability to supplement our service offerings with engineered solutions specifically tailored to address customers’ completion requirements and challenges.
We believe the demand for our services will increase over the medium and long-term as a result of a number of favorable industry trends. While drilling and completion activity has improved along with a rebound in commodity prices from their lows in early 2016 of $26.19 per barrel (based on the Cushing WTI Spot Oil Price (“WTI”)) and $1.49 per million British Thermal Units (“mmBtu”) for natural gas, we believe there are long-term fundamental demand and supply trends that will benefit our company. We believe demand for our services will grow from:
•    increases in customer drilling budgets focused in our core service areas; 
•    increases in the percentage of rigs that are drilling horizontal wells; 
•    increases in the length of the typical horizontal wellbore; 
•    increases in the number of fracture stages in a typical horizontal wellbore; and 
•    increases in pad drilling and simultaneous fracturing/wireline operations. 
We believe demand and pricing for our services will be further enhanced by a reduction in available hydraulic fracturing equipment as a result of: 
•    cannibalization of parked equipment and increased maintenance costs; 
•    aging of existing fleets given the limited investment since the industry downturn in late 2014; 

• | increased customer focus on well-capitalized, safe and efficient service providers that can meet or exceed their requirements; and

5

•    reduced access to capital for fleet acquisition, maintenance and deployment. 
Pricing levels for our industry’s services are driven primarily by asset utilization. With the downturn in commodity prices from late 2014 into 2016, per Coras Research, LLC, asset utilization across the hydraulic fracturing industry declined from 77% at the end of 2014 to 60% at the end of 2016. As of December 31, 2016, of our total 23 hydraulic fracturing fleets, 13 fleets, or 56% of our total fleets, were deployed. We believe our asset utilization rate reflects the quality of our assets and services. 
In addition, due to lack of investment in maintenance and aging equipment, per Coras Research, LLC, approximately 89% of active industry equipment was deployed as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had 16 active hydraulic fracturing fleets, of which 13 fleets, or 87%, were deployed. As of February 28, 2017, we had 16 active hydraulic fracturing fleets, all of which were deployed. Based on current pricing for component parts and labor, we believe our remaining seven inactive fleets can be made operational at a cost of less than $2.0 million per fleet.
Our History 
Our company was founded in 1973 by the Keane family in Lewis Run, Pennsylvania. We have been well regarded as a customer-focused operator that prioritizes safety, the environment and our relationship with the communities in which we operate. We are committed to maintaining conservative financial policies and a disciplined approach to asset deployment, adding new capacity with customers with significant capital budgets and steady development programs rather than on a speculative basis. 
We have developed what we believe is an industry-leading, completions-focused platform by emphasizing health, safety and environmental stewardship as our highest priority, implementing an efficient cost structure focused on disciplined cost controls, establishing a sophisticated supply chain and investing in state-of-the-art systems and leveraging technology and infrastructure to support growth. Through these initiatives, our platform has demonstrated the ability to scale with an increase in activity. For example, in 2013, we organically entered into the Bakken Formation, where we remain one of the most active service providers, and, in 2014, we successfully recruited and integrated over 450 employees into our business, resulting in a 74% increase in our employee base. 
We believe that our ability to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions is a competitive advantage. We have demonstrated the ability to grow both organically and through opportunistic acquisitions. From 2010 to 2014, we organically added seven hydraulic fracturing fleets deployed across the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the Bakken Formation and the Permian Basin. We have also completed three acquisitions that have diversified our geographic presence and service line capabilities. In April 2013, we acquired the wireline technologies division of Calmena Energy Services, which provided us with wireline operations capabilities in the U.S. In December 2013, we acquired the assets of Ultra Tech Frac Services to establish a presence in the Permian Basin. In March 2016, we completed the opportunistic acquisition of Trican’s U.S. oilfield service operations resulting in the expansion of our hydraulic fracturing operations to the current 23 fleets and establishing Keane as one of the largest pure-play providers of integrated well completion services in the U.S. with approximately 944,250 hydraulic horsepower. This acquisition added high quality equipment, provided increased scale in key operating basins, expanded our customer base and offered significant cost reduction opportunities. We implemented a plan to achieve over $80 million of annualized cost savings as a result of facility consolidations, head count rationalization and procurement savings. The Trican transaction also enhanced our access to proprietary technology and engineering capabilities that have improved our ability to provide integrated services solutions. We intend to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions on an opportunistic basis that would complement our existing service offerings or expand our geographic capabilities. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe that technical expertise, fleet capability, equipment quality and robust preventive maintenance programs, integrated solutions, experience, scale in leading basins and health, safety and environmental (“HSE”) performance are the primary differentiating factors within the industry. We specialize in providing customized completion solutions to our customers that increase efficiency, improve safety and lower their overall cost. 
6

Accordingly, we believe the following strengths differentiate us from many of our competitors and contribute to our ongoing success: 
Multi-Basin Service Provider with Close Proximity to Our Customers. 
We provide our services in several of the most active basins in the U.S., including the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the SCOOP/STACK Formation, the Bakken Formation and the Eagle Ford Shale. These regions are expected to account for approximately 87% of all new horizontal wells anticipated to be drilled between 2017 and 2020. In addition, the high-density of our operations in the basins in which we are most active provides us the opportunity to leverage our fixed costs and to quickly respond with what we believe are highly efficient, integrated solutions that are best suited to address customer requirements. 
In particular, we are one of the largest providers in the Permian Basin and the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the most prolific and cost-competitive oil and natural gas basins in the United States, respectively. According to Spears & Associates, the Permian Basin and the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale are expected to account for the greatest crude oil and natural gas production growth in the U.S. through 2020 based on forecasted rig counts. These basins have experienced a recovery in activity since the spring of 2016, representing approximately 59% of the increase in U.S. rig count from its May 2016 low of 404 to 658 as of December 2016. 
Our Houston, Texas-based headquarters, eight field offices and numerous management and sales offices are in close proximity to unconventional resource plays which allows us to take a hands-on approach to customer relationships at multiple levels within our organization, anticipate our customers’ needs and efficiently deploy our assets. 
The below map represents our areas of operation: 
Customer-Tailored Approach. 
We seek to develop long-term partnerships with our customers by investing significant time and effort educating them on our value proposition and maintaining a continuous dialogue as we deliver ongoing service. We believe our direct line of communication with our customers at the senior management level as well as with key operational managers in the field provides us with the ability to address issues quickly and efficiently and is highly valued by our customers. In November 2016, we received Shell Global Solutions International’s annual Well Services Performance Award in recognition of our Permian Basin team’s exceptional 2016 performance and customer service in hydraulic fracturing and wireline services. 
7

In connection with the Trican transaction, we acquired our Engineered Solutions Center, which we believe provides value-added capabilities to both our new and existing customers. We believe our Engineered Solutions Center enables us to support our customers’ technical specifications with a focus on reducing costs and increasing production. As pressure pumping complexity increases and the need for comprehensive, solution-driven approaches grows, our Engineered Solutions Center is able to meet our customers’ business objectives cost-effectively by offering flexible design solutions that package our services with new and existing product offerings. Our Engineered Solutions Center is focused on providing (1) economical and effective fracture designs, (2) enhanced fracture stimulation methods, (3) next-generation fluids and technologically advanced diverting agents, such as MVP Frac™ and TriVert™, which we received the right to use as part of the Trican transaction, (4) dust control technologies and (5) customized solutions to individual customer and reservoir requirements. 
Track Record of Providing Safe and Reliable Solutions. 
Safety is our highest priority and we believe we are among the safest service providers in the industry. For example, we achieved a total recordable incident rate (“TRIR”), which we believe is a reliable measure of safety performance, that is substantially less than the industry average from 2013 to 2016. We believe we have an industry leading behavior-based safety program to ensure each employee understands the importance of safety. Depending on job requirements, each new employee goes through a rigorous on-boarding and training program, is assigned a dedicated mentor, is routinely subject to our “Fit for Duty” verification program and periodically attends safety and technical certification programs. Our customers seek to protect their field employees, contractors and communities in which they serve as well as minimize the risk of disproportionately high costs that can result from an HSE incident. As a result, our customers demand robust HSE programs from their service providers and view safety records as a key criterion for vendor selection. We believe our safety and training record creates a competitive advantage by enhancing our ability to develop long-term relationships with our customers, allowing us to qualify to tender bids on more projects than many of our competitors and enabling us to attract and retain employees. 
Modern, High-Quality Asset Base and Robust Maintenance Program. 
We have invested in modern equipment, including dual-fuel fracturing pumps, Tier IV engines, stainless steel fluid ends, dry friction reducer and dry guar, to enhance our efficiency and safety. In addition, our high-quality, heavy-duty hydraulic fracturing and wireline fleets reduce operational downtime and maintenance costs while enhancing our ability to provide reliable, safe and consistent service to our customers. We have approximately 944,250 total hydraulic horsepower and can deploy up to 23 hydraulic fracturing fleets. As of December 31, 2016, we had 13 hydraulic fracturing fleets and eight wireline trucks deployed. We believe we have a robust preventative maintenance program for both our active and inactive fleets which allows us to respond to customer demand in a timely, safe and cost-efficient manner, and we continue to invest in and stock critical parts and components. From April 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, we commissioned seven hydraulic fracturing fleets to service customers at a total cost of approximately $11.0 million, including capital expenditures. In addition, based on current pricing for component parts and labor, we believe our remaining inactive hydraulic fleets can be made operational at a cost of less than $2.0 million per fleet. Based upon our recent deployment experience, we believe it takes up to 45 days to activate and staff a single well completions fleet including hydraulic fracturing and wireline crews, allowing us to quickly and cost-effectively respond to an increase in customer demand. Our conservative financial profile and continued investment in our assets and fleets should enable us to maintain an efficient operating cost structure as we begin to redeploy assets, ensuring our operators have safe, well-maintained equipment to service our customers. 
Flexible Supply Chain Management Capabilities. 
Our sophisticated logistics network is comprised of strategically-located field offices, proppant storage facilities and proprietary last-mile transportation solutions. We have a dedicated supply chain team that manages sourcing and logistics to ensure flexibility and continuity of supply in a cost-effective manner across all areas of operation. We maintain multi-year relationships with industry-leading suppliers of proppant and have contracted secure supply at pricing reflecting current market conditions for the majority of our expected demand through 2020, based on existing job designs. We currently have a network of 1,046 modern railcars, which are being leased to us on a multi-year basis, and which provides us with valuable and flexible logistical support for our operations. Our logistics infrastructure also includes access to eight third-party unit train facilities, which improve railcar turn times 
8

and reduce transit costs, and approximately 50 transload facilities. In addition, we own over 120 pneumatic sand-hauling trucks for last-mile transportation to the well site, which gives us the ability to access and deliver proppant where and when needed. We believe our supply chain and logistics network provide us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to quickly respond during periods of increased demand for our services.
Strong Balance Sheet and Disciplined Use of Capital. 
We believe our balance sheet strength represents a significant competitive advantage, allowing us to pro-actively maintain our fleet while also pursuing opportunistic initiatives to further grow and expand our base business with new and existing customers. Our customers seek to employ well-capitalized service providers that are in the best position to meet their service requirements and their financial obligations, and, as a result, we intend to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. 
We adjust our capital expenditures based on prevailing industry conditions, the availability of capital and other factors as needed. Throughout the industry downturn that began in 2014, we have prioritized continued investment in our robust maintenance program to ensure our fleet of equipment can be deployed efficiently as demand recovers. At December 31, 2016, we had $48.9 million on an actual basis and $146.1 million of cash on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the IPO and the use of net proceeds received by us in connection with the IPO. Additionally, we had $40.3 million of availability under our 2016 ABL Facility (as defined herein), providing us with the means to fund deployment of inactive fleets and grow our operations. After giving effect to the ABL Refinancing Transaction (as defined herein), we would have had $50.4 million of availability under our New ABL Facility (as defined herein) as of December 31, 2016 on an as adjusted basis. As of February 28, 2017, we had $90.3 million of availability under our New ABL Facility. We intend to continue to prioritize maintenance, upgrades, refurbishments and acquisitions, in a disciplined and diligent manner, carefully evaluating these investments based on their ability to maintain or improve our competitive position and strengthen our financial profile while creating value for our shareholders.
Best-in-Class Management Team with Extensive Industry Experience. 
The members of our management team are seasoned operating, financial and administrative executives with extensive experience in and knowledge of the oilfield services industry. Our management team is led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James C. Stewart, who has over 30 years of industry experience. Each member of our management team brings significant leadership and operational experience with long tenures in the industry and respective careers at highly regarded companies, including Schlumberger Limited, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Weatherford International, Marathon Oil, Anadarko Petroleum and General Electric. The members of our executive management team provide us with valuable insight into our industry and a thorough understanding of customer requirements. 
Our Strategy 
Our principal business objective is to increase shareholder value by profitably growing our business while safely providing best-in-class completion services. We expect to achieve this objective through: 
Efficiently Capitalizing on Industry Recovery. 
Hydraulic fracturing represents the largest cost of completing a shale oil or gas well and is a mission-critical service required for the continued development of U.S. shale resources. Upon a recovery in demand for oilfield services in the U.S., the hydraulic fracturing sector is expected to have among the highest growth rates among oilfield service providers. Industry reports have forecasted that the North American onshore stimulation sector, which includes hydraulic fracturing, will increase at a compound annual growth rate, a measure of growth rate for selected points in time, of 10% from 2006 to 2020 and of 30% from 2016 through 2020. As a well-capitalized provider operating in the most active unconventional oil and natural gas basins in the U.S., we believe that our business is well positioned to capitalize efficiently on an industry recovery. We have invested significant resources and capital to develop a market leading platform with demonstrated capabilities and technical skills that is well equipped to address increased demand from our customers. We believe that our rigorous preventative maintenance program provides us with a well-maintained hydraulic fracturing fleet and the ability to deploy inactive fleets 
9

efficiently. Based upon our recent experience and current pricing for components and labor, we believe it will take approximately 45 days to activate a single hydraulic fracturing fleet, allowing us to quickly and cost-effectively respond to an increase in customer demand at a cost of less than $2.0 million per fleet. We also believe we can incrementally deploy each of our wireline trucks in less than 30 days at a nominal cost. 
Developing and Expanding Relationships with Existing and New Customers. 
We target well-capitalized customers that we believe will be long-term participants in the development of conventional and unconventional resources in the U.S., value safe and efficient operations, have the financial stability and flexibility to weather industry cycles and seek to develop a long-term relationship with us. We believe our high-quality fleets, diverse completion service offerings, engineering and technology solutions and geographic footprint with basin density in some of the most active basins position us well to expand and develop relationships with our existing and new customers. These qualities, combined with our past performance, have resulted in the renewal and new award of service contracts by our customers and by an expansion of the basins in which we operate for these customers. We believe these arrangements will provide us an attractive revenue stream while leaving us the ability to deploy our remaining fleets as industry demand and pricing continue to recover. We have invested in our sales organization, nearly tripling its headcount over the past two years. Together with our sales team, our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer are deeply involved with our commercial sales effort, fostering connectivity throughout a customer’s organization to further develop the relationship. We believe this level of senior management engagement differentiates us from many of our larger integrated peers. 
Continuing Our Industry Leading Safety Performance and Focus on the Environment. 
We are committed to maintaining and improving the safety, reliability, efficiency and environmental impact of our operations, which we believe is key to attracting new customers and maintaining relationships with our current customers, regulators and the communities in which we operate. As a result of our strong emphasis on training and safety protocols, we have one of the best safety records and reputations in the industry which helps us to attract and retain employees. We have maintained a strong safety record even as our employee base increased by 574% over the past four years. From the beginning of 2013 to 2016, our TRIR and lost time incident rate (“LTIR”) dropped by approximately 69% and 75%, respectively, and, for the year ended December 31, 2016, our TRIR and LTIR statistics were 0.22 and 0.06, respectively. We believe we are among the safest service providers in the industry. For example, we achieved a TRIR, which we believe is a reliable measure of safety performance, that is substantially less than the industry average from 2013 to 2016. In addition, all of our field-based management are provided financial incentives to satisfy safety standards and customer expectations, which we believe motivates them to continually maintain a focus on quality and safety. We work diligently to meet or exceed applicable safety and environmental requirements from our customers and regulatory agencies, and we intend to continue to enhance our safety monitoring function as our business grows and operating conditions change. For example, we have made investments in more efficient engines and dual-fuel kits to comply with customer requirements to reduce emissions and noise at well site. In 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration jointly finalized standards for new on-road medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and engines that would improve fuel efficiency and cut carbon emissions. In accordance with the new standards, all of the Company’s hydraulic fracturing fleets with model years from 2018 onwards will have Tier IV engines. In addition, we have also invested in spill prevention equipment and remediation systems and dust control technology, which we believe allows us to meet or exceed the latest Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) requirements and standards. We have also deployed high-grade cameras to remotely monitor high-risk zones in our field operations, which we believe helps reduce safety risks to our employees. We believe that our commitment to maintaining a culture that prioritizes safety and the environment is critical to the long-term success and growth of our business.
Investing Further in Our Robust Maintenance Program. 
We have in place a rigorous preventative maintenance program to continuously maintain our fleets, resulting in less downtime, reduced equipment failure in demanding conditions, lower operating costs and overall safer and more reliable operations. Due to our strong balance sheet, we have been able to sustain investment in maintenance, including preemptive purchases of key components and upgrades to our fleets throughout the downturn. We believe 
10

that the quality of our fleets and our maintenance program enhance our ability to both secure contracts with new customers and to service our existing customers reliably and efficiently. Our active fleet uptime is reinforced by preventive maintenance on our equipment, allowing us to minimize the negative impact to our customers from equipment failure. In addition, we continue to monitor advances in hydraulic fracturing and wireline technology and make strategic purchases to enhance our existing capabilities.
Maintaining a Conservative Balance Sheet to Preserve Operational and Strategic Flexibility. 
We carefully manage our liquidity by continuously monitoring cash flow, capital spending and debt capacity. Our focus on maintaining our financial strength and flexibility provides us with the ability to execute our strategy through industry volatility and commodity price cycles, as evidenced by our recent completion of the Trican transaction and continued investment in our robust maintenance program. We intend to maintain a conservative approach to managing our balance sheet to preserve operational and strategic flexibility. At December 31, 2016, we had $48.9 million and $146.1 million of cash on hand on an actual basis and on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the use of net proceeds received by us in connection with the IPO, respectively. Additionally, we had $40.3 million of availability under our 2016 ABL Facility, providing us with the means to fund deployment of fleets and grow our operations. After giving effect to the ABL Refinancing Transaction, we would have had $50.4 million of availability under our New ABL Facility as of December 31, 2016 on an as adjusted basis. As of February 28, 2017, we had $90.3 million of availability under our New ABL Facility. 
We have further described our outstanding balances and current activities for our Notes, our 2016 Term Loan Facility and the recent New Term Loan Facility (as defined herein) with Owl Rock closed on March 15, 2017, in Note 8 (Long- Term Debts) and Note 25 (Subsequent Events) of Keane Group’s financial statements included in Part II, “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Continued Evaluation of Consolidation Opportunities that Strengthen Capabilities and Create Value. 
We believe that our ability to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions is a competitive advantage. Since 2011, we have completed three acquisitions that have diversified our geographic presence and service line capabilities. In April 2013, we acquired the wireline technologies division of Calmena Energy Services to expand our wireline operations capabilities in the U.S. In December 2013, we acquired the assets of Ultra Tech Frac Services to establish a presence in the Permian Basin. In March 2016, we completed the Trican transaction, creating a leading independent provider of hydraulic fracturing services in the United States. This acquisition added high quality equipment, provided increased scale in key operating basins, expanded our customer base and offered significant cost reduction opportunities. To date we have identified and implemented a plan to achieve over $80 million of annualized cost savings as a result of facility consolidations, head count rationalization and procurement savings. The Trican transaction also provided us access to proprietary technology and engineering capabilities that have enhanced our ability to provide integrated services solutions. We intend to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions on an opportunistic basis that would complement our existing service offerings or expand our geographic capabilities and allow us to earn an appropriate return on invested capital. 
Our Industry 
Our industry provides oilfield services to North American onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Demand for our industry’s services is predominantly influenced by the completion of hydraulic fracturing stages in unconventional wells in North America, and is driven by several factors including rig count, well count, service intensity and the timing and style of well completions. Ultimately, these drivers depend primarily on the level of drilling activity by oil and natural gas companies, which, in turn, depends largely on the current and anticipated prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. 
Impact of Current and Anticipated Prices for Crude Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids 
Oil and natural gas prices began to decline drastically beginning late in the second half of 2014 and remained low through early 2016. This decline, sustained by global oversupply of oil and natural gas, drove our industry into a downturn. Following a trough in early 2016, oil prices and natural gas prices have recovered to $53.75 and $3.71, 
11

respectively, or approximately 105%, and 149% respectively, as of December 31, 2016, from their lows in early 2016 of $26.19 and $1.49, respectively. U.S. rig count has recovered to 658, or approximately 63%, as of December 31, 2016, from its low of 404 in early 2016. Recent events, including declines in North American production and agreements by OPEC members to reduce oil production quotas, have provided upward momentum for energy prices. We believe that recent increases in oil and natural gas prices, as well as moderate relief from the global oversupply of oil and domestic oversupply of natural gas, should increase demand for our services and create a more stable demand environment than has been experienced in the prior 24 months.
The US Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”) projects that the average WTI spot price will increase through 2040 from growing demand and the development of more costly oil resources. The EIA anticipates continued growth in the long-term U.S. domestic demand for natural gas, supported by various factors, including (i) expectations of continued growth in the U.S. gross domestic product; (ii) an increased likelihood that regulatory and legislative initiatives regarding domestic carbon emissions policy will drive greater demand for cleaner burning fuels such as natural gas; (iii) increased acceptance of natural gas as a clean and abundant domestic fuel source that can lead to greater energy independence of the U.S. by reducing its dependence on imported petroleum; (iv) the emergence of low-cost natural gas shale developments; and (v) continued growth in electricity generation from intermittent renewable energy sources, primarily wind and solar energy, for which natural-gas-fired generation is a logical back-up power supply source. We believe that as the prices of oil and natural gas increase, exploration and production activity will increase, driving an increased demand for our services. 
Shale Resources in North America
The combined application of hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling technologies and their refinement continues to provide additional resource potential with new multi-billion barrel fields of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas discovered over last five years. As of 2014, the EIA identified 59 billion barrels of recoverable tight oil and 610 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas within the United States, ranking it second to Russia globally in shale oil resources. We believe that this inventory, which has increased materially due to technological innovation, should create multi-decade demand for our industry’s services. 
In addition, we believe that U.S. unconventional shale resources will continue to capture an increasing share of global capital spending on oil and natural gas resources as a result of their competitive positioning on the global cost curve and the relatively low level of political and legal risk in North America as compared to other regions. From 2015 to 2016, demand for global liquids, or oil and natural gas liquid products, increased by approximately 1.8 million barrels per day according to the EIA. The EIA further expects global liquids demand to increase by approximately 1.6 million barrels per day from 2016 to 2017. Similarly, natural gas demand in North America is expected to increase by approximately 1.5 billion cubic feet per day by 2018, largely based upon growth in industrial and household demand, an increase in natural gas exports and continued substitution of gas for coal by utilities and industry. Furthermore, Spears & Associates estimates that capital expenditures for drilling and completion in the contiguous United States will increase by 38% over the next two years, which we believe would benefit our industry.
Increases in Horizontal Drilling Activity and Stages Per Well. 
Over the past decade, oil and gas companies have focused on exploiting the vast resource potential available across many of North America’s unconventional resource plays through the application of horizontal drilling and completion technologies, including the use of multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, in order to increase recovery of oil and natural gas. In turn, E&P companies are focused on utilizing drilling and completion equipment and techniques that optimize cost and efficiency. As E&P companies have continued to refine the methodology used to recover oil and natural gas from wells, they have generally favored increases in both the number of hydraulic fracturing stages per well, with growth in per well stage count of approximately 75% between 2012 and 2016, and the amount of proppant used per stage, with growth in proppant per stage of approximately 54% from 2012 to 2016. Both of these secular trends have driven incremental demand for our industry’s services for each completed well due to requirements for larger amounts of equipment. For example, despite a 67% decline in the number of wells drilled from the 2014 to 2016 and excluding the acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations, we have increased the volume of work our company has performed by 42% during the same period as measured by stage count.

Many industry experts predict a significant recovery in drilling activity in 2017 and 2018. According to Spears & Associates, total U.S. drilling rig count is expected to reach approximately 823 and 982 in 2017 and 2018, respectively, with approximately 79% expected to be drilling wells with horizontal laterals. Due to improvements in technology, including increased lateral lengths and tighter spacing between stages, drilling rigs have become more efficient in recent years. From 2012 to 2016, average wells per horizontal drilling rig have increased from 13.6 wells per rig to 21.1 wells per rig, respectively, and average stages per horizontal well have increased from 16.3 stages per well to 28.5 stages per well, respectively.
Demand for our industry’s services is also influenced by the natural decline in productivity of shale oil and gas wells over time. The amount of hydrocarbons produced from a typical shale oil and gas well declines more quickly than a conventional well, with production from a shale well generally falling substantially in the first year. New wells are required to be brought online relatively quickly to replace production lost from the natural decline. As a result of the high average production decline rates and current demand forecasts, we believe that a large number of wells will need to be drilled and completed on a continuous basis to offset production declines. 
In addition, according to the EIA, an estimated 5,379 drilled but uncompleted (“DUC”) wells were in backlog as of December 2016, which we believe will provide a near-term source of demand for completion related services. The decline in commodity prices that began in late 2014 resulted in many E&P companies delaying the completion or fracturing of drilled wells, which represents approximately 36% of the total cost of a well. In connection with the increase and stabilization of the price of oil, E&P companies have recently begun to work through their DUC inventory in select basins, such as the Permian Basin and Bakken Formation, allowing us to deploy additional resources to such basins as a result.
 Decline in Number of Service Providers, Deployable Capacity and Skilled Labor as a Result of Cyclical Downturn 
From late 2009 through late 2014, there was a rapid increase in the demand for fracturing services. This growth in demand was met with an influx of new companies providing such services and a large increase in deployable hydraulic fracturing equipment. Since late 2014, the significant decline in demand for hydraulic fracturing services and resulting overcapacity in the market have led to industry consolidation and attrition, with the estimated number of service providers shrinking from a peak of 54 service providers in 2014 to 39 service providers as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, based on estimated deployable capacity, there were six large providers with over 1 million horsepower, 10 medium-sized providers, including us, with between 300,000 and 1 million horsepower, and 23 smaller providers with less than 300,000 horsepower. We believe industry consolidation will position our company to succeed as demand for our industry’s services continues to increase. 
We also believe that the financial distress of many of our competitors has caused them to significantly lower maintenance spending, and instead remove existing parts and components from idle equipment to service active equipment, which has reduced, and will continue to reduce, the amount of deployable equipment. While the total supply of deployable equipment, as compared to marketed equipment, is opaque, industry analysts estimate that total marketed and deployable capacity has declined between 25% and 50% from its peak. Due to the significant wear and tear on working equipment from high service intensity, the potential cost for other providers to redeploy older, idle fleets may be as much as $10 million to $20 million per fleet, depending on the level of previous use and preventative maintenance spend, as well as the amount of time spent idle. We believe these significant redeployment costs may drive the permanent retirement of older equipment by some of our competitors. As demand for our industry’s services increases, we believe we will benefit from our rigorous preventative maintenance program in contrast to many of our competitors’ underinvestment in, and resulting loss of, deployable equipment. 
Finally, in addition to the reduction in number of service providers and deployable hydraulic fracturing equipment, headcount of total oilfield service employees in our industry is estimated to have decreased by 46% from its 2014 peak to 2016. We believe that companies that have remained relatively active during the industry downturn, such as ours, will benefit from retaining and developing skilled personnel as demand for our industry’s services increases.
Segments
13

We are organized into two reportable segments, consisting of Completion Services, including our hydraulic fracturing and wireline divisions; and Other Services, including our coiled tubing, cementing and drilling divisions. This segmentation is based on the primary end markets we serve, our customer base, the complementary nature of our services, our management structure and the financial information that is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We evaluate the performance of these segments based on equipment utilization, revenue, segment gross profit, gross margin and resulting synergistic efficiency of utilization. We monitor our cost of services using such metrics as cost of operations per stage for divisions in our Completion Services segment and cost of operations per working day for divisions in our Other Services segment. For further information on our operating segments, please see Note 21 (Business Segments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Completion Services Segment
Hydraulic Fracturing.    We provide hydraulic fracturing and related well stimulation services to E&P companies, particularly to those operating in unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs and requiring technically and operationally advanced services. Hydraulic fracturing services are performed to enhance production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability and restricted flow of hydrocarbons. Our customers benefit from our expertise in fracturing of horizontal and vertical oil- and natural gas-producing wells in shale and other unconventional geological formations. 
The process of hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a highly viscous, pressurized fracturing fluid—typically a mixture of water, chemicals and guar—into a well casing or tubing in order to fracture underground mineral formations. These fractures release trapped hydrocarbon particles and free a channel for the oil or natural gas to flow freely to the wellbore for collection. Fracturing fluid mixtures include proppant which become lodged in the cracks created by the hydraulic fracturing process, “propping” them open to facilitate the flow of hydrocarbons upward through the well. Proppant generally consists of raw sand, resin-coated sand or ceramic particles. The fracturing fluid is engineered to lose viscosity, or “break,” and is subsequently removed from the formation, leaving the proppant suspended in the mineral fractures. Once our customer has flushed the fracturing fluids from the well using a controlled flow-back process, the customer manages fluid and water removal. 
Our technologically advanced fleets consist of mobile hydraulic fracturing units and other auxiliary heavy equipment to perform fracturing services. Our hydraulic fracturing units consist primarily of high-pressure hydraulic pumps, diesel engines, radiators and other supporting equipment that are typically mounted on flat-bed trailers. We refer to the group of units and other equipment, such as blenders, data vans, sand storage, tractors, manifolds and high pressure fracturing iron, which are necessary to perform a typical fracturing job as a “fleet,” and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a “crew.” We have 23 hydraulic fracturing fleets, of which 13 were deployed as of December 31, 2016 with crews ranging from 24 to 55 employees each. 
An important element of hydraulic fracturing services is determining the proper fracturing fluid, proppant and injection program to maximize results. Our field engineering personnel provide technical evaluation and job design recommendations for customers as an integral element of our hydraulic fracturing service. Technological developments in the industry over the past several years have focused on proppant density control, liquid gel concentration capabilities, computer design and monitoring of jobs and clean-up properties for fracturing fluids. 
We provide our services in several of the most active basins in the U.S., including the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the SCOOP/STACK Formation, the Bakken Formation and the Eagle Ford Shale. These regions are expected to account for approximately 87% of all new horizontal wells anticipated to be drilled between 2017 and 2020.
Wireline Technologies.    Our wireline services involve the use of a single truck equipped with a spool of wireline that is unwound and lowered into oil and natural gas wells to convey specialized tools or equipment for well completion, well intervention, pipe recovery and reservoir evaluation purposes. We typically provide our wireline services in conjunction with our hydraulic fracturing services in “plug-and-perf” well completions to maximize efficiency for our customers. “Plug-and-perf” is a multi-stage well completion technique for cased-hole wells that 
14

consists of pumping a plug and perforating guns to a specified depth. Once the plug is set, the zone is perforated and the tools are removed from the well, a ball is pumped down to isolate the zones below the plug and the hydraulic fracturing treatment is applied. The ball-activated plug diverts fracturing fluids through the perforations into the formation. Our ability to provide both the wireline and hydraulic fracturing services required for a “plug-and-perf” completion increases efficiencies for our customers by reducing downtime between each process, which in turn allows us to complete more stages in a day and ultimately reduces the number of days it takes our customer to complete a well. We have 23 wireline units, of which eight were deployed as of December 31, 2016 with crews of approximately 10 to 12 employees each. 
Other Services Segment
Coiled Tubing.    We provide various coiled tubing services to facilitate well servicing and workover operations as well as the completion of horizontal wells. Coiled tubing services involve the use of a flexible, continuous metal pipe spooled on a large reel which is then lowered into oil and natural gas wells to perform various workover applications, including wellbore clean outs and maintenance, nitrogen services, thru-tubing fishing, and formation stimulation using acid and other chemicals. Advantages of utilizing coiled tubing over a more costly workover rig include: (i) the smaller size and mobility of a coiled tubing unit compared to a workover rig, (ii) the ability to perform workover applications without having to “shut-in” the well during such operations, (iii) the ability to reel continuous coiled tubing in and out of a well significantly faster than conventional pipe, and (iv) the ability to direct fluids into a wellbore with more precision. Larger diameter coiled tubing units have recently been utilized for horizontal well completion applications such as (i) the drill out of temporary isolation plugs that separate frac zones, (ii) the clean out of the well for final production after the hydraulic fracturing job has been completed and (iii) in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing operations to stimulate zones not requiring high pressures or significant proppant volume. 
Drilling, Cementing, Acidizing and Nitrogen Services.    We are also equipped to offer our customers drilling, cementing, acidizing and nitrogen-based well stimulation services. 
Equipment 
We have approximately 944,250 hydraulic horsepower and can deploy up to 23 fleets, of which 13 fleets were deployed as of December 31, 2016. Our hydraulic fracturing equipment consists of modern units specially designed to handle well completions with long lateral segments and multiple fracturing stages in high-pressure and unconventional formations. We also maintain a fleet of 23 wireline units (of which eight were deployed as of December 31, 2016), seven coiled tubing units, 14 cementing units and two fit-for-purpose Schramm rigs for top-hole air drilling. 
Each hydraulic fracturing fleet also includes the necessary blending units, manifolds, data vans and other ancillary equipment. We have the flexibility to allocate pressure pumps and other equipment among our fleets as needed to satisfy customer demand. 
Our hydraulic fracturing equipment is comprised of components sourced from manufacturers including Caterpillar, Inc., Cummins, Inc. and Gardner Denver, Inc. and was assembled by various North American companies including Surefire Industries, LLC and UE Manufacturing, LLC. We historically have purchased the majority of our wireline, coiled tubing and cementing units from System One MFG Inc., Surefire Industries, LLC and Peerless Limited, respectively. Our company is not dependent on any one company for the source of our components and assembly of our equipment. We believe our equipment is in good condition and suitable for our current operations. 
Customers 
Our customers primarily include major integrated and large independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top three customers, Shell Exploration & Production, XTO Energy and Seneca Resources Corporation, collectively accounted for approximately 48% of total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our top four customers, EQT Production Company, Shell Exploration & Production, XTO Energy and Southwestern Energy Company, collectively accounted for 
15

approximately 90% of total revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, on an actual basis, no other customers accounted for 10% or more of our revenues.
Suppliers 
We purchase the materials used in our hydraulic fracturing, wireline and other services from various suppliers. In March 2016, in connection with the Trican transaction, Keane received the right to use certain Trican proprietary fracking-related fluids as of the closing date of the Trican transaction, such as MVP Frac™ and TriVert™ (the “Fracking Fluids”), for Keane’s pressure pumping services to its customers, which license does not allow Keane to manufacture the Fracking Fluids but allows Keane to purchase the Fracking Fluids from Trican’s suppliers.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased approximately 5% to 10% of our materials or equipment, as a percentage of overall costs, from Gardner Denver. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased approximately 5% to 10% of our materials or equipment, as a percentage of overall costs, from Surefire Industries, LLC, Santrol, D & I Silica LLC and Precision Additives Inc.
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are manufactured and supplied for our operations. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption or shortage in the supply of certain of our materials. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements, such as guar (which experienced a shortage and significant price increase in 2012), could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
Competition 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We provide services in various geographic regions across the United States, and our competitors include many large and small oilfield service providers, including some of the largest integrated service companies. Our integrated hydraulic fracturing and wireline services compete with large, integrated oilfield service companies such as Halliburton Company, Schlumberger Limited and Baker Hughes Incorporated, as well as other companies such as RPC, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc., C&J Energy Services, Inc., Basic Energy Services, Inc. and FTS International, Inc. Our hydraulic fracturing services also compete with Calfrac Well Services Ltd., U.S. Well Services, Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., ProPetro Services, Inc. and Liberty Oilfield Services. In addition, the business segments in which we compete are highly fragmented. We also compete regionally with a significant number of smaller service providers. 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are technical expertise, equipment capacity, work force competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience and price. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. While we seek to be competitive in our pricing, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on safety, performance and quality of our crews, equipment and services. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest-quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment. 
Cyclical Nature of Industry 
We operate in a highly cyclical industry. The key factor driving demand for our services is the level of drilling activity by E&P companies, which in turn depends largely on current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas prices and production depletion rates. Global supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas are critical in assessing industry outlook. Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to large, rapid fluctuations. Producers tend to increase capital expenditures in response to increases in oil and natural gas prices, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies such as ours. Increased capital expenditures also ultimately lead to greater production, which historically has resulted in increased supplies 
16

and reduced prices which in turn tend to reduce demand for oilfield services. For these reasons, the results of our operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and these fluctuations may distort comparisons of results across periods. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 1,401 people, of which approximately 72% were compensated on an hourly basis. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, nor are they members of labor unions. We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory. 
Seasonality 
Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, oil and natural gas and, as a result, demand for our services. Demand for oil and natural gas is typically higher in the fourth and first quarters resulting in higher prices. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis. 
Insurance 
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including accidents, blowouts, explosions, craterings, fires, oil spills and hazardous materials spills. These conditions can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment, the environment and wildlife, and interruption or suspension of operations, among other adverse effects. In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the well services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in our being named as a defendant to a lawsuit asserting significant claims. 
Despite our efforts to maintain high safety standards, we from time to time have suffered accidents in the past and we anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property and personal losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability, as well as our relationships with customers, employees and regulatory agencies. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. 
We carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations, and we are partially self-insured for certain claims, in amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable. However, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or may not cover all losses. Historically, insurance rates have been subject to various market fluctuations that may result in less coverage, increased premium costs, or higher deductibles or self-insured retentions. 
Our insurance includes coverage for commercial general liability, damage to our real and personal property, damage to our mobile equipment, pollution liability (covering both third-party liabilities and first-party site specific property damage), workers’ compensation and employer’s liability, auto liability and other specialty risks. Our insurance includes various limits and deductibles or self-insured retentions, which must be met prior to, or in conjunction with, recovery. Specifically, our commercial general liability policy provides for a limit of $2 million per occurrence and $4 million per project in the aggregate. Our excess liability program is structured in three layers: the lead policy provides for a limit of $5 million per occurrence and $5 million in the aggregate, with a $10,000 self-insured retention per incident; the second layer provides for a limit of $20 million per occurrence and $20 million in the aggregate, with a $10,000 self-insured retention per incident; and the third layer provides for a limit of $50 million per occurrence and $50 million in the aggregate, with a $10,000 self-insured retention per incident. 
To cover potential pollution risks, our commercial generally liability policy is endorsed with sudden and accidental coverage and our excess liability policies provide additional limits of liability for covered sudden and accidental pollution losses. Additionally, we maintain a contractors’ pollution liability program that provides for a 
17

total limit of $20 million per incident and $20 million in the aggregate with a self-insured retention of $100,000 per incident for both sudden and gradual pollution liability. We also maintain $100 million in excess insurance over the contractors’ pollution liability policy for sudden pollution incidents. 
In addition, we maintain site specific pollution insurance that provides for a limit of $10 million per incident and $10 million in the aggregate with a $100,000 deductible per incident for both on and off-site clean-up as well as third-party property damage and bodily injury. Our site-specific pollution coverage affords third-party liability and first party clean-up coverage. Our contractors’ pollution liability insurance covers liabilities associated with our hydraulic fracturing operations in the field, while our site-specific pollution insurance covers liabilities arising from insured locations. The insured locations are properties that we own or lease. 
Environmental Regulation 
Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry, including the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the EPA, issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require costly compliance measures. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, expenditures associated with exposure to hazardous materials, remediation of contamination, property damage and personal injuries, imposition of bond requirements, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental damages and clean-up costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. Strict adherence with these regulatory requirements increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. However, environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements, including those that result in any limitation, suspension or moratorium on the services we provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by federal, state, regional or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as “CERCLA” or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous or other state-regulated substances into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and the parties that disposed or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or other state-regulated substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict liability, joint and several liability, or both, for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, damages to natural resources and health studies without regard to fault. In addition, companies that incur CERCLA liability frequently confront claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous or other regulated substances or pollutants into the environment. 
The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, (“RCRA”) and analogous state law generally excludes oil and gas exploration and production wastes (e.g., drilling fluids, produced waters) from regulation as hazardous wastes. However, these wastes remain subject to potential regulation as solid wastes under RCRA and as hazardous waste under other state and local laws. Moreover, wastes from some of our operations (such as, but not limited to, our chemical development, blending and distribution operations as well as some maintenance and manufacturing operations) are or may be regulated under RCRA and analogous state law under certain circumstances. Further, any exemption or regulation under RCRA does not alter treatment of the substance under CERCLA. 
From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, the federal Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”), and analogous state laws. Under these laws or other laws and regulations, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate these materials or wastes and make expenditures associated with personal injury or property damage. At this time, with respect to any properties 
18

where materials or wastes may have been released, it is not possible to estimate the potential costs that may arise from unknown, latent liability risks. However, at this time, we have not been made aware of any such releases. 
There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. Companion bills entitled the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness Chemicals Act (“FRAC Act”) were reintroduced in the House of Representatives in May 2013 and in the United States Senate in June 2013. If the FRAC Act and other similar legislation pass, the legislation could significantly alter regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing. Currently, unless the fracturing fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process contains diesel fuel, hydraulic fracturing operations are exempt from permitting under the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program in the SDWA. The FRAC Act would remove this exemption and subject hydraulic fracturing operations to permitting requirements under the UIC program. The FRAC Act and other similar bills propose to also require persons conducting hydraulic fracturing to disclose the chemical constituents of their fracturing fluids to a regulatory agency, although they would not require the disclosure of the proprietary formulas except in cases of emergency. Currently, several states already require public disclosure of non-proprietary chemicals on FracFocus.org and other equivalent Internet sites. Disclosure of our proprietary chemical formulas to third parties or to the public, even if inadvertent, could diminish the value of those formulas and could result in competitive harm to our business. At this time, it is not clear what action, if any, the United States Congress will take on the FRAC Act or other related federal and state bills, or the ultimate impact of any such legislation. 
If the FRAC Act or similar legislation becomes law, or the Department of the Interior or another federal agency asserts jurisdiction over certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations, additional regulatory requirements could be established at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs, making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increasing the costs of compliance and doing business for us and our customers. States in which we operate have considered and may again consider legislation that could impose additional regulations and/or restrictions on hydraulic fracturing operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of these state actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing. Our compliance, or the consequences of any failure to comply, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results. 
In addition, at the direction of Congress, the EPA undertook a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater and issued its report in December of 2016. The EPA report states that there is scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking resources under some circumstances, and identifies certain conditions in which the EPA believes the impact of such activities on drinking water and groundwater can be more frequent or severe. The EPA study could spur further initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. Similarly, other federal and state studies, such as those currently being conducted by, for example, the Secretary of Energy’s Advisory Board and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, may recommend additional requirements or restrictions on hydraulic fracturing operations. 
The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from specified sources. We are or may be required to obtain federal and state permits in connection with certain operations of our manufacturing and maintenance facilities. These permits impose certain conditions and restrictions on our operations, some of which require significant expenditures for filtering or other emissions control devices at each of our manufacturing and maintenance facilities. Changes in these requirements, or in the permits we operate under, could increase our costs or limit certain activities. Additionally, the EPA’s Transition Program for Equipment Manufacturers regulations apply to certain off-road diesel engines used by us to power equipment in the field. Under these regulations, we are subject to certain requirements with respect to retrofitting or retiring certain engines, and we are limited in the number of new non-compliant off-road diesel engines we can purchase. Engines that are compliant with the current emissions standards can be costlier and can be subject to limited availability. It is possible that these regulations could limit our ability to acquire a sufficient number of diesel engines to expand our fleet and/or upgrade our existing equipment by replacing older engines as they are taken out of service. 
19

Exploration and production activities on federal lands may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment of the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our activities and our customers’ current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. 
Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Clean Water Act and CERCLA. Government entities or private parties may act to prevent oil and gas exploration activities or seek damages where harm to species, habitat or natural resources may result from the filling of jurisdictional streams or wetlands or the construction or release of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of these speculative federal, state or private actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations with respect to these matters. However, compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results. 
The EPA has proposed and finalized a number of rules requiring various industry sectors to track and report, and, in some cases, control greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA’s Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule was published in October 2009. This rule requires large sources and suppliers in the United States to track and report greenhouse gas emissions. In June 2010, the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule became effective. For this rule to apply initially, the source must already be subject to the Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration program or Title V permit program; we are not currently subject to either Clean Air Act program. On November 8, 2010, the EPA finalized a rule that sets forth reporting requirements for the petroleum and natural gas industry. Among other things, this final rule requires persons that hold state permits for onshore oil and gas exploration and production and that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to annually report carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide combustion emissions from (1) stationary and portable equipment and (2) flaring. Under the final rule, our customers may be required to include calculated emissions from our hydraulic fracturing equipment located on their well sites in their emission inventory. 
The trajectory of future greenhouse regulations remains unsettled. In March 2014, the White House announced its intention to consider further regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. It is unclear whether Congress will take further action on greenhouse gases, for example, to further regulate greenhouse gas emissions or alternatively to statutorily limit the EPA’s authority over greenhouse gases. Even without federal legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, states may pursue the issue either directly or indirectly. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry and, therefore, could reduce the demand for our products and services. 
Climate change regulation may also impact our business positively by increasing demand for natural gas for use in producing electricity and as a transportation fuel. Currently, our operations are not materially adversely impacted by existing state and local climate change initiatives. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business. 
We seek to minimize the possibility of a pollution event through equipment and job design, as well as through training employees. We also maintain a pollution risk management program in the event a pollution event occurs. This program includes an internal emergency response plan that provides specific procedures for our employees to follow in the event of a chemical release or spill. In addition, we have contracted with several third-party emergency responders in our various operating areas that are available on a 24-hour basis to handle the remediation and clean-up of any chemical release or spill. We carry insurance designed to respond to foreseeable environmental pollution events. This insurance portfolio has been structured in an effort to address pollution incidents that result in bodily

injury or property damage and any ensuing clean up required at our owned facilities, as a result of the mobilization and utilization of our fleets, as well as any environmental claims resulting from our operations. See “—Insurance.” 
We also seek to manage environmental liability risks through provisions in our contracts with our customers that generally allocate risks relating to surface activities associated with the fracturing process, other than water disposal, to us and risks relating to “down-hole” liabilities to our customers. Our customers are responsible for the disposal of the fracturing fluid that flows back out of the well as waste water, for which they use a controlled flow-back process. We are not involved in that process or the disposal of the fluid. Our contracts generally require our customers to indemnify us against pollution and environmental damages originating below the surface of the ground or arising out of water disposal, or otherwise caused by the customer, other contractors or other third parties. In turn, we generally indemnify our customers for pollution and environmental damages originating at or above the surface caused solely by us. We seek to maintain consistent risk-allocation and indemnification provisions in our customer agreements to the extent possible. Some of our contracts, however, contain less explicit indemnification provisions, which typically provide that each party will indemnify the other against liabilities to third parties resulting from the indemnifying party’s actions, except to the extent such liability results from the indemnified party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional act. 
Safety and Health Regulation 
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, which is administered and enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, commonly referred to as OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. OSHA continues to evaluate worker safety and to propose new regulations, such as but not limited to, the proposed new rule regarding respirable silica sand. Although it is not possible to estimate the financial and compliance impact of the proposed respirable silica sand rule or any other proposed rule, the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Intellectual Property 
Our engineering and technology efforts are focused on providing cost-effective solutions to the challenges our customers face when fracturing and stimulating wells. In connection with the Trican transaction, we acquired our Engineered Solutions Center, which we believe provides value-added capabilities to both our new and existing customers. We believe our Engineered Solutions Center enables us to support our customers’ technical specifications with a focus on reducing costs and increasing production. As pressure pumping complexity increases and the need for comprehensive, solution-driven approaches grows, our Engineered Solutions Center is able to meet our customers’ business objectives cost-effectively by offering flexible design solutions that package our services with new and existing product offerings. Our Engineered Solutions Center is focused on providing (1) economical and effective fracture designs, (2) enhanced fracture stimulation methods, (3) next-generation fluids and technologically advanced diverting agents, such as MVP Frac™ and TriVert™, which we received the right to use as part of the Trican transaction, (4) dust control technologies and (5) customized solutions to individual customer and reservoir requirements. 
In addition, in connection with the Trican transaction, we acquired ownership of substantially all intellectual property relating primarily to Trican’s United States oilfield services business, which includes know-how, trade secrets, formulas, processes, customer lists and other non-registered intellectual property primarily used in connection with that business. Keane also entered into two fully paid-up, perpetual, non-exclusive licenses to certain intellectual property owned by Trican or its affiliates, other than the Acquired Trican Intellectual Property (as defined herein). See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions and Director Independence—Trican Transaction” for more information. We believe that the proprietary technology and engineering capabilities acquired in the Trican transaction have enhanced our integrated services solutions and better positioned our company to meet our customers’ technical demands.

We believe the information regarding our customer and supplier relationships are also valuable proprietary assets. We have pending applications and registered trademarks for various names under which our entities conduct business or provide products or services. Except for the foregoing, we do not own or license any patents, trademarks or other intellectual property that we believe to be material to the success of our business. 
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and, for so long as we are an emerging growth company, are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These include, but are not limited to:

• | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;


• | not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;


• | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and


• | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

We may remain an “emerging growth company” until as late as December 31, 2022, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if (1) we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue in any fiscal year, (2) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 or (3) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen to irrevocably “opt out” of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted.
