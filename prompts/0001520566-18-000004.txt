OVERVIEW
Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in 2011, including our consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, "Nationstar", the "Company", "we", "us" or "our"), earns fees through the delivery of servicing, origination and transaction based services related primarily to single-family residences throughout the United States. 
We are one of the largest residential loan servicers in the United States. In addition, we operate an integrated residential loan origination platform with a primary focus on customer retention and an array of complementary services related to the purchase and disposition of residential real estate. 
Our success ultimately depends on working with customers, investors and regulators to deliver quality, compliant solutions that foster and preserve home ownership. Customers include most residential real estate market participants including homeowners, homebuyers, home sellers, investors and real estate agents. Investors primarily include government sponsored entities ("GSE") such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae" or "FNMA") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp ("Freddie Mac" or "FHLMC"), investors in private-label securitizations, the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae" or "GNMA"), as well as organizations owning mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") which engage us to subservice. We are regulated both at the Federal and individual state levels. 
In August 2017, we rebranded our operating company, Nationstar Mortgage LLC, to “Mr. Cooper” with the goal of reinventing the mortgage experience and keeping the dream of homeownership alive. The rebrand is a representation of our journey to reinvent customer experience and enhance customer retention. With a continued focus on improving customer service and responding to direct customer feedback, in the last year we launched a new website and mobile application with more user-friendly tools and features and moved our international call center operations back to the United States. We are also focused on continuously improving the customer boarding process.
PROPOSED MERGER WITH WMIH CORP. 
On February 12, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with WMIH Corp., a Delaware corporation (“WMIH”), and Wand Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMIH (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMIH. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) and as a result of the Merger, each share of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, WMIH or Merger Sub or by any Company stockholder who properly exercises and perfects appraisal of his, her or its shares under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share, (i) $18.00 per share in cash, without interest, or (ii) 12.7793 shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of WMIH common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (“WMIH Common Stock”), subject in each case to pro rata cutbacks to the extent cash or stock is oversubscribed (the “Merger Consideration”). The aggregate amount of cash to be issued as Merger Consideration in the Merger will be approximately $1.2 billion. The Company’s stockholders must make a cash or stock election at least three business days prior to the closing date, and election forms will be mailed at least twenty business days prior to the election deadline. In addition, WMIH has secured $2.75 billion of financing commitments in connection with the transaction. The Company’s existing senior unsecured notes of approximately $1.9 billion is assumed to be repaid at closing. 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to certain exceptions, (i) each then-outstanding share of Nationstar restricted stock will automatically vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, in the form of cash or WMIH Common Stock as elected by the holder thereof, and (ii) each then-outstanding Nationstar restricted stock unit, whether vested or unvested, will automatically vest in full, be assumed by WMIH and converted into a WMIH restricted stock unit entitling the holder thereof to receive upon settlement the Merger Consideration, as elected by the holder, as described above with respect to shares of Nationstar restricted stock, with such payment of cash or delivery of WMIH Common Stock as soon as practicable but no later than three business days after the Effective Time.
Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K 3

The Company has made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants (i) to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger; (ii) not to engage in specified types of transactions during this period unless agreed to in writing by WMIH, whose consent cannot be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; (iii) to convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders; and (iv) subject to certain exceptions, to include the recommendation of the board of directors of the Company that its stockholders approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement in its proxy statement for the foregoing stockholders’ meeting. Each of the parties has agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated, including obtaining required regulatory approvals, provided that neither WMIH nor any of its affiliates will be required to agree to or accept a Burdensome Condition.
The consummation of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including the following mutual conditions to the obligations of the parties: (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of Nationstar’s outstanding common stock; (ii) the approval of the issuance of WMIH Common Stock in the Merger (the “WMIH Share Issuance”) by a majority of all votes cast by holders of outstanding shares of WMIH Common Stock and preferred stock (voting on an as-converted basis in accordance with WMIH’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation); (iii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iv) obtaining required regulatory approvals as specified in the schedules to the Merger Agreement without the imposition of a burdensome condition that would have a material adverse effect on Nationstar and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, following the Merger (“Burdensome Condition”); (v) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the Merger; (vi) the approval for listing the WMIH Common Stock issuable in the Merger on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, subject to official notice of issuance; (vii) there being no law or injunction prohibiting consummation of the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement; (viii) subject to specified materiality standards, the continuing accuracy of certain representations and warranties of each party; and (ix) performance by each party in all material respects with its covenants. The receipt of a tax opinion from WMIH’s tax advisor that there should not have been an “ownership change” (within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code) since March 19, 2012, and the Merger, taken together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and occurring on the closing date, should not result in such an ownership change, is a condition to the obligations of Nationstar to consummate the Merger.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We conduct our operations through three operating segments: Servicing, Originations and Xome®. For financial information concerning our operating segments, see Note 20, Business Segments Reporting, in the consolidated financial statements.
Servicing
As of December 31, 2017, we serve approximately 3.3 million customers with an aggregate unpaid principal balance ("UPB") of approximately $508 billion. We are the largest non-bank servicer and third largest residential mortgage servicer in the United States according to Inside Mortgage Finance. During 2017, we boarded $175 billion UPB of loans and ended 2017 with another record breaking year-end UPB in our history. 
We service loans on behalf of investors or owners of the underlying mortgages, and because we do not generally hold loans for investment purposes, our loss exposure is limited to investor guidelines regarding the servicing of delinquent loans. We have exposure to credit risk to the extent we are required to make servicing advances or in certain circumstances, with Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") or Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") loans. Servicing consists of collecting loan payments, remitting principal and interest payments to investors, managing escrow funds for the payment of mortgage-related expenses, such as taxes and insurance, performing loss mitigation activities on behalf of investors and otherwise administering our mortgage loan servicing portfolio.
4 Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K 

The chart below sets forth the portfolio mix between serviced, subserviced and reverse loans as of December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
Owned forward servicing
We own the right to service loans owned by investors, which typically result from bulk acquisitions, flow agreements, or the sale and securitization of loans we originate. Where we own the right to service loans, we recognize a MSR asset in our consolidated financial statements and have elected to mark this portfolio to fair value each quarter. Servicing activities for owned MSRs include the collection and recording of mortgage payments, the administration of mortgage escrow accounts, negotiations of workouts and modifications and, if necessary, conducting or managing the foreclosure (real estate owned or "REO") on behalf of investors or other servicers. We primarily generate recurring revenue through contractual fees earned from our MSRs, which are a stated percentage of the UPB of current performing loans and ancillary revenues (e.g., modification fees, late fees, incentive fees). As the MSR owner, we are, in several instances, obligated to make servicing advances to fund scheduled principal, interest, tax and insurance payments when the mortgage loan borrower has failed to make the scheduled payments and to cover foreclosure costs and various other items that are required to preserve the assets being serviced. These servicer advance obligations require significant capital and liquidity in order to fund the advances until we are contractually authorized to reimburse ourselves for the advances from the loan investor.
Servicing revenues are intended to cover the costs and operating risks associated with MSR ownership, which include carrying costs associated with advances to pay taxes, insurance and foreclosure costs and also include costs incurred as a result of potential operational errors.
Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K 5

Subservicing
We service loans on behalf of our clients who own the underlying servicing rights. Since we do not own the right to service the loan, we do not recognize an asset in our consolidated financial statements. We primarily generate revenue based upon a stated fee per loan that varies based on the loans' delinquency status. Subservicing fee revenue is generally less than the servicing fee received by the owner of the MSR; however, subservicing loans reduces the interest rate exposure and related revenue volatility from MSR fair value changes and eliminates compensating interest expense and payoff-related costs. As a subservicer, we may be obligated to make servicing advances; however, advances and other incurred costs are generally lower compared to owned MSR portfolios, and recovery times are substantially faster, often within the following month. Capital requirements for subservicing arrangements are lower than for owned MSRs. Additionally, our exposure to foreclosure-related costs and losses is generally limited in our subservicing relationships as those risks are retained by the owner of the MSR.
During 2017, we continued to expand our subservicing portfolio by boarding $145 billion UPB of subservicing. We believe the expansion of subservicing operations allows us to leverage the scale of our technology and labor capital to provide cost effective servicing to customers while limiting the use of cash resources, thereby producing a higher return on equity. Certain subservicing agreements also provide a flow of new loans to help replenish and grow our own serviced portfolio.
Reverse servicing
Included within owned MSRs are the rights to service reverse residential mortgage loans acquired from third parties through our Champion Mortgage brand. Our reverse portfolio includes loans in Ginnie Mae and private-label securitizations, as well as unsecuritized reverse loans held by investors, such as Fannie Mae. A servicing fee is earned based on the stated service fee rate or net interest margin of home equity conversion mortgage ("HECM") mortgage-backed securities of the reverse portfolio. As a servicer, we are required to fund advances on the reverse loans up to the maximum claim amount. These advances include borrower draws and advances to cover taxes, insurance, mortgage insurance premiums and servicing fees. Recovery of advances and collection of servicing fees generally occurs upon a transfer of ownership in the underlying collateral. Due to the structure of reverse mortgages, we securitize substantially all draws on reverse mortgage loans through the Ginnie Mae II MBS program or through private-label securitizations. Our reverse portfolio accounts for 6.9% of our total servicing UPB as of December 31, 2017.
The majority of loans we serviced are for GSEs, followed by Ginnie Mae and private-label investors in mortgage securitization transactions. The chart below sets forth the composition of our servicing portfolio ending UPB by investor group as of December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
6 Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K 

Our serviced portfolio includes both conventional residential mortgage loans and home equity conversion loans, referred to as “forward” and “reverse” loans, respectively. Although we own the mortgage servicing rights for the majority of these loans, we also act as master servicer on certain portfolios and subservicer on certain portfolios for which the servicing rights are owned by a third party.
Focus on the Customer
We are focused on providing quality service to our customers. For each loan we service, we utilize a customer-centric model designed to increase borrower performance and to decrease borrower delinquencies. Keys to this model include frequent borrower interactions and utilization of multiple loss mitigation strategies particularly in the early stages of a default. We train our customer service representatives to find solutions that work for homeowners when circumstances allow. We believe this commitment to continued home ownership helps preserve neighborhoods and home values and improves asset performance for our investors.
Between 2010 and 2013, we acquired distressed portfolios from banks who were not equipped to service such highly delinquent portfolios. The unprecedented levels of delinquencies and defaults of residential real estate loans after the crisis required varying degrees of loss mitigation activities. Foreclosure is usually a last resort, and accordingly, we have made, and continue to make, significant efforts to help borrowers remain in their homes. In 2017, our outreach initiatives to customers resulted in 21,593 Home Affordable Refinance Program ("HARP") refinancings and modifications resulting in cost savings to customers averaging $1,786 per year. These initiatives also lowered loan delinquency rates exceeding 60 days from 4.7% to 3.4%.
The mortgage experience is often complex, but we aim to take a leadership role in the industry by putting customers first and preserving homeownership. We have strengthened the composition of our leadership team and altered incentive programs over the past four years to emphasize the importance of teamwork, compliance and a customer-centric approach. As part of our rebranding efforts, in 2017, we rolled out a number of features designed to improve our customers’ experience, including moving our international call center operations back to the United States. 
Originations
Our Originations segment provides integrated mortgage services primarily to our existing servicing customers through our direct-to-consumer platform. According to Inside Mortgage Finance, we were the 20th largest overall mortgage loan originator, funding $19 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. We generate revenue through fee-based mortgage loan origination services and the origination and sale of mortgage loans sourced through our direct-to-consumer and correspondent channels. We originate and purchase conventional mortgage loans conforming to the underwriting standards of the GSEs, which we collectively refer to as Agency loans. We also originate and purchase government-insured mortgage loans, which are insured by the FHA and VA. 
We believe our integrated origination platform provides us with competitive advantages including an organic source of servicing assets at attractive returns. The platform also serves as a loss mitigation solution for servicing clients and customers by offering refinancing options to borrowers thereby allowing them to lower their monthly payments which in turn may lower their risk of defaulting. 
We utilize warehouse facilities to fund originated loans. After we sell originated mortgage loans to secondary market investors, we generally retain the servicing rights on mortgage loans sold. The mortgage loans are typically sold within 30 days of origination in order to both mitigate credit risk and minimize the capital required. The majority of our mortgage loans were sold to, or was sold pursuant to, programs sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.
We are committed to providing our customers with the tools and resources they need to be successful in today's marketplace. We are focused on increasing conversion rates (i.e., recapture) on our existing servicing portfolio and expanding our correspondent channel through growing our third-party origination businesses. We have continued to diversify our origination business in order to be successful in multiple market scenarios by offering different products. We believe we can originate these products profitably and with acceptable levels of risk. We believe our experience in servicing difficult loans will allow us to also help borrowers obtain loans that are more challenging to originate. Building the sales and operations capacity to meet this need is a goal for the business, as well as operational improvements to drive productivity. We will continue to make investments towards acquiring new customers and expanding the purchase business. 
Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K 7

The chart below sets forth the originations funded volume for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
Direct-to-Consumer Channel
We originate loans directly with borrowers through our direct-to-consumer channel. This channel utilizes our call centers and our originations websites to reach new customers and our existing 3.3 million servicing customers who may benefit from a new mortgage. Depending on borrower eligibility, we will refinance existing loans into conventional, government or non-Agency products. Through lead campaigns and direct marketing, the direct-to-consumer channel seeks to convert leads into higher margin loans in a cost-efficient manner. We earn an upfront fee for processing the loan application which covers the costs of securing the loan application and underwriting.
Our direct-to-consumer channel represented 63.8%, 67.1% and 61.4% of our mortgage originations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pull through adjusted lock volume for this channel totaled $11.3 billion in 2017, $13.7 billion in 2016 and $11.3 billion in 2015.
Correspondent Channel
We purchase closed mortgage loans from community banks, credit unions, mortgage brokers and mortgage bankers. We primarily generate revenue from the receipt of underwriting fees from correspondents earned on a per-unit loan basis, as well as the gain on sale of loans sold into the secondary market.
Our correspondent channel represented 36.2%, 32.9% and 38.6% of our mortgage originations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pull through adjusted lock volume for this channel totaled $6.4 billion in 2017, $6.7 billion in 2016 and $7.1 billion in 2015.

Xome
The Xome (pronounced "Zome") segment is a leading provider of technology and data-enhanced solutions to home buyers, home sellers, real estate professionals and companies engaged in the origination and/or servicing of mortgage loans. Xome seeks to enhance the real estate experience by making the challenge of buying or selling real estate less complex and by increasing transparency through the partnering of both online and offline components of the transaction cycle. Xome provides services for leading financial institutions, mortgage companies and the GSEs. We plan to grow non-default property closing through our referral programs and provide additional products. In 2017, Xome provided services to two of the top five money center banks with various services including title and close, appraisal and, increasingly, technology solutions.
Xome's operations are comprised of Exchange, Services and Software as a Service ("SaaS").
Exchange is a national technology-enabled platform that manages and sells residential properties through our Xome.com platform. This platform leverages our proprietary auction technology and was designed to increase transparency, reduce fraud risk and provide better execution for property sales as evidenced by generally higher sales price and lower average days to sell compared to traditional sales. In 2017, we launched our sale by owner referral program, which allows homeowners selling their homes to have access to Xome's exchange platform, real estate agent panel, and transaction support to facilitate the lending, title and overall closing experience. This program has generated almost 700 closings, presenting opportunities for fee income, purchase originations and Xome downstream services. In the last three years, Xome Exchange has sold approximately 50,000 properties and ranks as one of the top sites for residential real estate sales based on number of monthly visits it receives. Core services include traditional non-distressed sales, REO auctions, short sales and foreclosure trustee sales. 
Services connects the major touch points of the real estate transactions process by providing title, escrow and collateral valuation services for purchase, refinance and default transactions. We continue to serve existing third-party customers and capture refinance and default transactions generated by our Servicing and Originations segments. Over the last three years, Xome Services has completed approximately 604,000 title and close orders, 669,000 collateral valuation orders and 400,000 property reports. In 2017, we gained over 10 new title clients, which will drive additional third-party revenues. 
SaaS includes our software as a service platform providing integrated technology, media and data solutions to real estate franchisors, brokerages, agents and multiple listing service ("MLS") organizations and associations. SaaS contains a diversified set of businesses including Real Estate Digital ("RED") (MLS data and broker tools), Quantarium (data analytics), Go Paperless (e-signature platform), Xome Signings (notary services), and Xome Labs (product/technology development incubation lab). 
Through our Xome platform, we enhance the home buying and selling experience via investments in technology and a focus on customer service to make the home transaction experience simpler, more transparent and more accessible for all market participants. The Xome platform is accessible through a combination of a web-based platform and easy to use mobile apps, giving customers access to over 95% of all active MLS listings in the United States. The platform allows users to search among distressed and non-distressed real estate listings on a single website, which we believe is a significant advantage over competitor platforms which generally support either distressed or non-distressed listings, but not both.

Competition
Our Servicing segment primarily competes against large financial institutions and non-bank servicers. Some of our biggest competitors are large banks, which includes Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Chase Home Finance and Bank of America. Non-bank servicers continue to play an increasingly important role in the mortgage industry, and we compete with companies which include Quicken Loans, Freedom Mortgage, Ocwen Financial Corporation, PHH Corporation, Walter Investment Management and PennyMac Financial Services among others. 
The subservicing market in which we operate is also highly competitive. We compete with non-bank servicers, such as Cenlar FSB, Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc., PHH Corporation, and LoanCare, and we face competition related to subservicing pricing and service delivery. Our competitive position is also dependent on our continued ability to demonstrate compliance with local, state, federal and investor regulations or requirements and to improve technology and processes while controlling our costs to maintain competitive pricing. Finally, we manage the risk of declining subservicing units due to payoffs by entering into new arrangements and executing our portfolio retention initiatives to grow our subservicing portfolio.
Our Originations segment competes based on product offerings, rates, fees and customer service. In recent years, more restrictive loan underwriting standards and the widespread elimination of certain non-conforming mortgage products throughout the industry have resulted in a more homogeneous product offering, which has increased competition across the industry for mortgage originations. The industry is also presented with heightened challenges and costs associated with the increasingly complex regulatory compliance environment.
Many of our Originations competitors are commercial banks or savings institutions. These financial institutions typically have access to greater financial resources, have more diverse funding sources with lower funding costs, are less reliant on the sale of mortgage loans into the secondary markets to maintain their liquidity, and may be able to participate in government programs that we are unable to participate in because we are not a state or federally chartered depository institution, all of which places us at a competitive disadvantage. 
10 Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. - 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K 

Our primary competitive strength flows from our ability to market our products to our existing servicing portfolio. Our subservicing model also provides a significant advantage compared to other originators. Our Originations segment is highly dependent on our customer relationships. Many smaller and mid-sized financial institutions may find it difficult to compete in the mortgage industry due to the significant market share of the largest competitors, along with the continual need to invest in technology in order to reduce operating costs while maintaining compliance with more restrictive underwriting standards and dynamic regulatory requirements. Our ability to win new clients and maintain existing customers is largely driven by the high levels of customer service we provide and our ability to comply and adapt to an increasingly complex regulatory environment.
Competitive factors in the Xome segment include the quality and timeliness of our services, the size and competence of our network of vendors, the breadth of the services we offer, the quality of the technology-based application or service, and pricing. Based on our knowledge of the industry and competitors, we also believe that no single competitor offers the range of solutions we are able to offer.
The industry verticals in which the Xome segment engages are highly competitive and generally consist of a few national companies, as well as a large number of regional, local and in-house providers, resulting in a fragmented market with disparate service offerings. Our Exchange unit competes with national and regional third-party service providers and in-house servicing operations of large mortgage lenders and servicers. We also compete with companies providing online real estate auction services and real estate brokerage firms. Our SaaS unit competes with data processing and software development companies and in-house technology and software operations of other loan servicers. In addition, our customers retain multiple providers and continuously evaluate our performance against various other competitors.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 7,600 employees, none of which were subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our future success will depend, in part, on our continuing ability to attract, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel.

A number of important factors exist that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to:

• | our ability to maintain or grow the size of our servicing portfolio;


• | our ability to maintain or grow our originations volume;


• | our ability to recapture voluntary prepayments related to our existing servicing portfolio;

All of the factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results, and may be beyond our control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all such factors or to assess the effect of each such new factor on our business. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and any of these statements included herein may prove to be inaccurate. Given the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or our objectives and plans will be achieved. Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of this report for further information on these and other factors affecting our business.
