Item 1 — Business (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic)
General
The Registrants are wholesale power generation subsidiaries of NRG, which is a competitive power company that produces, sells and delivers electricity and related services, primarily in major competitive power markets in the U.S. GenOn is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NRG. GenOn was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on August 9, 2000, under the name Reliant Energy Unregco, Inc. GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of GenOn. GenOn Americas Generation was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on November 1, 2001, under the name Mirant Americas Generation, LLC. GenOn Mid-Atlantic was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on July 12, 2000, under the name Southern Energy Mid-Atlantic, LLC. GenOn Mid-Atlantic is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG North America and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GenOn Americas Generation. The Registrants are engaged in the ownership and operation of power generation facilities; the trading of energy, capacity and related products; and the transacting in and trading of fuel and transportation services.
The Registrants’ generation facilities are located in the U.S. and comprise generation facilities across the merit order. The sale of capacity and power from baseload and intermediate generation facilities accounts for a majority of the Registrants’ generation revenues. In addition, the Registrants’ generation portfolio provides each with opportunities to capture additional revenues by selling power during periods of peak demand, offering capacity or similar products, and providing ancillary services to support system reliability.
The following table summarizes the generation portfolio as of December 31, 2016, by Registrant: 

 | (In MW)(a)
Generation Type | GenOn | GenOn Americas Generation | | GenOn Mid-Atlantic
Natural gas(b)(c) | 10,377 | | 4,040 | | | 1,864
Coal(d) | 4,199 | | 2,433 | | | 2,433
Oil | 1,847 | | 1,434 | | | 308 
Total generation capacity | 16,423 | | 7,907 | | 4,605


(a) | MW figures provided represent nominal summer net MW capacity of power generated as adjusted for the Registrants' owned or leased interest excluding capacity from inactive/mothballed units.


(b) | GenOn's natural gas generation portfolio includes 325 MW related to the gas addition of New Castle Units 3-5 which was completed in the second quarter of 2016 and 597 MW related to the gas addition of Shawville which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. GenOn's natural gas generation does not include 78 MW related to the Chalk Point capital lease which expired at the end of 2015, 352 MW related to Shelby which was sold on March 1, 2016 and 878 MW related to Aurora which was sold on July 12, 2016. 


(c) | GenOn's natural gas generation portfolio includes 275 MW related to Choctaw Unit 1 which is in forced outage which is expected to return to service in December 2017.


(d) | GenOn's coal generation portfolio does not include 325 MW related to New Castle Units 3-5, which completed a gas addition in the second quarter of 2016, 597 MW related to Shawville, which completed a gas addition in the fourth quarter of 2016, and 94 MW related to Avon Lake Unit 7, which was deactivated in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, GenOn's coal generation portfolio does not include 525 MW related to Seward which was sold on February 2, 2016. 

Seasonality and Price Volatility
Annual and quarterly operating results of the Registrants' wholesale power generation segments can be significantly affected by weather and energy commodity price volatility. Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas, interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels of hydroelectric capacity, can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility. The preceding factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across the Registrants' wholesale generation business.

2016 Significant Events and Developments
Going Concern
As disclosed in Item 15 — Note 1, Nature of Business and Note 9, Debt and Capital Leases, as of December 31, 2016, $691 million of GenOn's Senior Notes outstanding, excluding $8 million of associated premiums, are current within the GenOn consolidated balance sheet and are due on June 15, 2017. GenOn's future profitability continues to be adversely affected by (i) a sustained decline in natural gas prices and its resulting effect on wholesale power prices and capacity prices, and (ii) the inability of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments to GenOn. Based on current projections, GenOn is not expected to have sufficient liquidity exclusive of cash subject to the restrictions under the GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA operating leases to repay the GenOn Senior Notes due in June 2017. As a result of these factors, there is substantial doubt about GenOn's ability to continue as a going concern.
NRG, GenOn's parent company, has no obligation to provide any financial support other than the credit agreement between NRG and GenOn which provides for a $500 million revolving credit facility, all of which can be utilized for revolving loans and letters of credit as further in described in Item 15 — Note 13, Related Party Transactions. As controlled group members, ERISA requires that NRG and GenOn are jointly and severally liable for the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees and the NRG Pension Plan, including the pension liabilities associated with GenOn employees.
GenOn is currently considering all options available to it, including negotiations with creditors and lessors, refinancing the GenOn Senior Notes, potential sales of certain generating assets as well as the possibility for a need to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. During 2016, GenOn appointed two independent directors, retained advisors and established a separate audit committee as part of this process. 
As of December 31, 2016, GenOn Americas Generation, a consolidated subsidiary of GenOn, has a note receivable due from GenOn Energy Holdings, a consolidated subsidiary of GenOn, of $315 million and an accounts payable due to GenOn Energy Holdings of $43 million under the intercompany cash management program as further described in Item 15 — Note 13, Related Party Transactions. The terms of the intercompany note do not provide for priority to GenOn Americas Generation and as such, there is no assurance that options pursued by GenOn will not have an adverse impact on GenOn Americas Generation’s liquidity. As such, there is substantial doubt about GenOn Americas Generation’s ability to continue as a going concern.
With respect to GenOn Mid-Atlantic, a consolidated subsidiary of GenOn, management has determined that while it has sufficient cash on hand to fund current obligations including operating lease payments due under the GenOn Mid-Atlantic operating leases as of December 31, 2016, the potential significant adverse impact of financial stresses at GenOn Mid-Atlantic's parent companies and, to a lesser extent, any adverse impact resulting from the notification by GenOn Mid-Atlantic's lessors alleging the existence of lease events of default as further described in Note 9, Debt and Capital Leases, has caused there to be substantial doubt about GenOn Mid-Atlantic's ability to continue as a going concern.
Dispositions & Deactivations
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Registrants completed dispositions of certain generating stations and real property further discussed in Item 15 — Note 3, Dispositions. The following table summarizes dispositions during 2016:

Name and Location of Facility | Net Generation Capacity (MW) | Power Market | Registrant | Date Sale Completed 
Seward, New Florence, PA | 525 | | PJM | GenOn | February 2, 2016 
Shelby, Neoga, IL | 352 | | PJM | GenOn | March 1, 2016 
Aurora, IL | 878 | | PJM | GenOn | July 12, 2016 
Potrero, San Francisco, CA (a) | — | | N/A | GenOn Americas Generation | September 26, 2016
 | 1,755 | | | | 

(a) The sale of Potrero consisted solely of real property, as the generating station was deactivated during the first quarter of 2011.
In addition, GenOn Americas Generation deactivated the Pittsburg Generating Station, a 1,029 MW natural gas-fired facility located in California, on January 1, 2017.
The Registrants' future operating revenues, gross margin and other operating costs may be adversely impacted as a result of facilities that have been sold or deactivated in 2016 or may be deactivated in the future.
6

Impairments 
During 2016, GenOn recorded impairment losses on its Mandalay and Ormond Beach operating units along with its leased interests in Keystone and Conemaugh totaling $194 million. In addition, GenOn Americas Generation recorded an impairment on the Pittsburg generating station during the fourth quarter of 2016 resulting in an impairment loss of $20 million. See Item 15 — Note 8, Impairments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Competition
Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive and commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants that compete on the basis of the location of their plants, fuel mix, plant efficiency and the reliability of the services offered. The Registrants compete on the basis of the location of their plants and ownership of portfolios of plants in various regions, which increases the stability and reliability of their energy revenues. Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is currently highly fragmented and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies the Registrants compete with depending on the market. Competitors include regulated utilities, municipalities, cooperatives and other independent power producers, and power marketers or trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions.
Competitive Strengths 
The Registrants’ power generation assets are diversified by fuel-type, dispatch level and region, which helps mitigate the risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles. The Registrants' baseload and intermediate facilities provide each with a significant source of cash flow, while the peaking facilities provide the Registrants with opportunities to capture significant upside potential that can arise from time to time during periods of high demand.
Many of the Registrants’ generation assets are located within densely populated areas, which tend to have higher wholesale pricing as a result of relatively favorable local supply-demand balance. The Registrants have generation assets located in or near the New York City, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas. These facilities, some of which are aging, are often ideally situated for repowering or the addition of new capacity because their location and existing infrastructure provide significant advantages over undeveloped sites.

(a) | Net coal capacity represents nominal summer net MW capacity of power generated as adjusted for the Registrants' ownership position excluding capacity from inactive/mothballed units.


(b) | Forecasted generation dispatch output (MWh) based on forward price curves as of December 31, 2016, which is then divided by number of hours in a given year to arrive at MW capacity. The dispatch takes into account planned and unplanned outage assumptions.


(c) | Includes amounts under power sales contracts and natural gas hedges. The forward natural gas quantities are reflected in equivalent GWh based on forward market implied heat rate as of December 31, 2016, and then combined with power sales to arrive at equivalent GWh hedged. The coal sales include swaps and delta of options sold which is subject to change. For detailed information on the Registrants' hedging methodology through use of derivative instruments, see discussion in Item 15 - Note 5, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 


(d) | Percentage hedged is based on total coal sales as described in (c) above divided by the forecasted coal capacity.


(e) | Represents all U.S. coal sales, including energy revenue and demand charges, excluding revenues derived from capacity auctions.

Regulatory Matters 
As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale energy markets, certain of the Registrants' subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include the CFTC and FERC, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where the Registrants' generating assets are located. In addition, the Registrants are subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO markets in which they participate. The Registrants must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where they operate.
Current Administration and Changeover at FERC — FERC is currently without a quorum and cannot issue orders in contested proceedings until a new Commissioner is appointed. FERC’s day-to-day work can continue through authority that has been delegated to FERC Staff. With a new administration and three vacant positions at FERC, the Registrants' business may be affected because its generation fleet is subject to changes in FERC regulatory policy.
PJM
2019/2020 PJM Auction Results — On May 24, 2016, PJM announced the results of its 2019/2020 base residual auction. GenOn (including GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) cleared approximately 6,766 MW of Capacity Performance product and 305 MW of Base Capacity product in the 2019/2020 base residual auction. GenOn's (including GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) expected capacity revenues from the 2019/2020 base residual auction for the 2019/2020 delivery year are approximately $260 million. GenOn Americas Generation (including GenOn Mid-Atlantic) cleared approximately 3,814 MW of Capacity Performance product in the 2019/2020 base residual auction. GenOn Americas Generation's (including GenOn Mid-Atlantic) expected capacity revenues from the 2019/2020 base residual auction for the 2019/2020 delivery year are approximately $140 million.

PJM Capacity Performance Appeals — On or about July 8, 2016, four petitions were filed at the D.C. Circuit seeking review of the FERC orders approving PJM's Capacity Performance revisions to its forward capacity market after motions for rehearing at FERC were denied on May 10, 2016. NRG intervened in these matters on July 29, 2016. On December 9, 2016, NRG, along with other generators and industry trade groups, filed a joint brief in support of FERC's decision. Briefing is complete and oral argument occurred in February 2017. This case governs capacity revenues already received by the Registrants, as well as the revenues for forward periods.
PJM Seasonal Capacity Proceeding — On November 17, 2016, PJM proposed to enhance the ability of capacity storage resources, intermittent resources, demand response, energy efficiency, and environmentally limited resources, or collectively the seasonal capacity performance resources, to participate in the BRA and qualify as a resource providing the capacity performance product through aggregation. NRG filed comments specifically supporting PJM’s proposal to modify the aggregation rules to allow seasonal capacity resources to aggregate across LDAs and to allow aggregations through RPM auctions. On January 23, 2017, PJM amended its proposal to address questions from FERC. The outcome of this proceeding could have a material impact on future PJM capacity prices.
Complaints Related to Extension of Base Capacity — In 2015, FERC approved changes to PJM's capacity market, which included moving from the Base Capacity product to the higher performance Capacity Performance product over the course of a five year transition. Under this transition, as of the May 2017 BRA, the Base Capacity product will no longer be available. Several parties have filed complaints at FERC seeking to maintain the RPM Base Capacity product for at least one more delivery year or until such time as PJM develops a model for seasonal resources to participate. If the transition is delayed, capacity prices could be materially impacted. The matters are pending at FERC.  
MOPR Revisions — On May 2, 2013, FERC accepted PJM's proposal to substantially revise its Minimum Offer Price Rule, or MOPR.  Among other things, FERC approved the portions of the PJM proposal that exempt many new entrants from demonstrating that their proposed projects are economic, as well as providing a similar exemption for public power entities and certain self-supply entities. This exemption is subject to certain conditions designed to limit the financial incentive of such entities to suppress market prices. On June 3, 2013, NRG filed a request for rehearing of the FERC order and subsequently protested the manner in which PJM proposed to implement the FERC order. On October 15, 2015, FERC denied the requests for rehearing and accepted PJM’s compliance filing.  NRG, along with other parties, filed a petition for review of FERC's decision with the D.C. Circuit. Briefing is complete. The case is pending at the D.C. Circuit.

Illinois Zero Emission Credit Legislation and Related PJM Complaint — Pursuant to legislation in Illinois, the Illinois Power Agency is to procure contracts for Zero Emission Credits, or ZECs, through a process that would take into account environmental benefits, including the preservation of zero emission facilities. The procurement would be subject to review by the Illinois Commerce Commission. These ZECs are out-of-market subsidies that threaten to artificially suppress prices in the PJM auctions.  On February 14, 2017, NRG, along with other companies, filed a complaint in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois; another plaintiff group filed a similar complaint on the same day.  
As a result of the ZEC scheme adopted by the Illinois legislature and to address the effect of subsidies set to be paid to Illinois to certain nuclear units, on January 9, 2017, NRG and other generators and its trade association filed a joint amendment to the pending complaint seeking to apply the MOPR in the capacity market to existing resources that receive out-of-market subsidies. This amendment is to the March 21, 2016 complaint filed by NRG and other companies related to ratepayer-funded subsidies approved by the PUCO.
New England (GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation)
2020/2021 ISO-NE Auction Results — On February 6, 2017, ISO-NE announced the results of its 2020/2021 forward capacity auction. GenOn, including GenOn Americas Generation, cleared 1,112 MW at $5.297 per KW month providing expected annual capacity revenues of $71 million.
Peak Energy Rent Adjustment Complaint — On September 30, 2016, the New England Power Generators Association, or NEPGA, filed a complaint against ISO-NE asking FERC to find the Peak Energy Rent, or PER, unjust and unreasonable. On January 9, 2017, FERC granted NEPGA’s complaint requiring a change to how the PER strike price is calculated and determine any refunds during the time period provided for in the complaint. The first FERC-ordered settlement conference occurred on February 16, 2017.
Performance Incentive Proposal — On January 17, 2014, ISO-NE filed at FERC to revise its forward capacity market, or FCM, by making a resource’s forward capacity market compensation dependent on resource output during short intervals of operating reserve scarcity. The ISO-NE proposal would replace the existing shortage event penalty structure with a new performance incentive mechanism, resulting in capacity payments to resources that would be the combination of two components: (1) a base capacity payment and (2) a performance payment or charge. The performance payment or charge would be entirely dependent upon the resource’s delivery of energy or operating reserves during scarcity conditions, and could be larger than the base payment.
On May 30, 2014, FERC found that most of the provisions in the ISO-NE proposal, with modifications, together with an increase to the reserve constraint penalty factors, provided a just and reasonable structure. FERC instituted a proceeding for further hearings and required ISO-NE to make a compliance filing to modify its proposal and adopt the increases to the reserve constraint penalty factors. FERC denied rehearing. The NEPGA filed a petition for review of FERC's decision with the D.C. Circuit. Briefing is complete. 
New York (GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation)
New York Clean Energy Standard and Zero Emission Credit Nuclear Bailout — On August 1, 2016, the NYSPSC issued its Clean Energy Standard, or CES, order.  The CES order included three main components: (i) a commitment to move New York to 50% renewables by 2030; (ii) new renewable energy credit pricing for both new and existing renewable facilities; and (iii) a ZEC that would provide more than $7.6 billion over 12 years in out-of-market subsidy payments to certain selected nuclear generating units in the state. The stated purpose of the ZECs is to keep nuclear units running even though they would be uneconomic and likely retire if they received compensation only from the FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power market. The ZECs would have the effect of suppressing wholesale market prices and interfere with the wholesale market.  On October 19, 2016, NRG, along with other entities, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, challenging the validity of the NYSPSC action and the ZEC program. On December 9, 2016, Exelon, the NYSPSC and other parties filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On January 6, 2017, NRG, along with other parties, filed an opposition to the motions to dismiss. The motions are pending before the U.S. District Court.
Independent Power Producers of New York (IPPNY) Complaint — On January 9, 2017, EPSA requested FERC to promptly direct the NYISO to file tariff provisions to address pending market concerns related to out of market payments to existing generation in the NYISO. This request was prompted by the ZEC program initiated by the NYSPSC. This request follows IPPNY’s complaint at FERC against the NYISO on May 10, 2013, as amended on March 25, 2014. The generators asked FERC to direct the NYISO to require that capacity from existing generation resources that would have exited the market but for out-of-market payments. Failure to implement buyer-side mitigation measures could result in uneconomic entry, which artificially decreases capacity prices below competitive market levels.

New York Public Service Commission Retail Energy Market Proceedings — On February 23, 2016, the NYSPSC issued what it refers to as its “Retail Reset” order, or Reset Order, in docket 12-M-0476 et al.  Among other things, the Reset Order instituted a price cap on energy supply offers and required many retail providers to seek affirmative consent from certain retail customers over a very short period of time to retain those customers.  Retail suppliers who cannot meet these conditions will be required to return their customers to energy supply service provided by the local utility. On July 25, 2016, the New York Supreme Court vacated part of the Reset Order on procedural grounds and remanded the matter to the NYSPSC for further consideration. Additionally, the Court affirmed the NYSPSC’s authority to regulate Energy Service Companies prices.  The matter is now on appeal before the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division. On December 2, 2016 in the same docket, the NYSPSC issued notice of an evidentiary proceeding and collaborative process to determine the future structure of the retail energy market in New York.  The outcome of this evidentiary and collaborative process, combined with the outcome of the appeal of the Reset Order, could affect the viability of the New York retail energy market.
MISO (GenOn)
Revisions to MISO Capacity Construct — On November 20, 2015, FERC issued a final order denying NRG’s request for rehearing of a 2012 FERC order approving the MISO capacity construct. NRG filed a petition for review of FERC’s decision with the D.C. Circuit on the grounds that FERC’s order denies merchant generators in MISO’s footprint any reasonable opportunity to recover their fixed costs. On November 2, 2016, NRG filed its initial brief and briefing continues. The eventual outcome of this proceeding could impact MISO’s attempts to redesign its capacity markets and thereby affect the value of NRG’s uncontracted assets within the MISO footprint. 
MISO Forward Capacity Market Design for Retail Choice States — MISO staff has proposed revisions to its market design by implementing a three-year Forward Resource Auction for Illinois and the portion of Michigan with Retail Choice Load with a Sloped Demand Curve.  On November 1, 2016, MISO filed its proposal with FERC. On December 14, 2016, NRG filed a protest to MISO’s proposal.  On February 2, 2017, FERC rejected MISO’s proposal.  
Environmental Matters
The Registrants are subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of power plants. The electric generation industry is facing new requirements regarding GHGs, combustion byproducts, water discharge and use, and threatened and endangered species. Future laws may require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or impose restrictions on the operations of the Registrants' facilities, which could have a material effect on the Registrants' operations. Complying with environmental laws involves significant capital and operating expenses. The Registrants decide to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options, and the expected economic returns on capital. 
A number of regulations with the potential to affect the Registrants and their facilities are in development, under review or have been recently promulgated by the EPA, including ESPS/NSPS for GHGs, ash disposal requirements, NAAQS revisions and implementation and effluent guidelines. The Registrants are currently reviewing the outcome and any resulting impact of recently promulgated regulations and cannot fully predict such impact until legal challenges are resolved and the new presidential administration decides how to proceed with some of the more controversial regulations. Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent over time, although this trend could change in the near term with respect to federal laws under the new U.S. presidential administration.
Ozone NAAQS — On October 26, 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule that reduces the ozone NAAQS to 0.070 ppm. If it survives legal challenges, this more stringent NAAQS will obligate the states to develop plans to reduce NOx (an ozone precursor), which could affect some of the Registrants' units.
11

Cross-State Air Pollution Rule — The EPA finalized CSAPR in 2011, which was intended to replace CAIR in January 2012, to address certain states' obligations to reduce emissions so that downwind states can achieve federal air quality standards. In December 2011, the D.C. Circuit stayed the implementation of CSAPR and then vacated CSAPR in August 2012 but kept CAIR in place until the EPA could replace it. In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit's decision. In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit lifted the stay of CSAPR. In response, the EPA in November 2014 amended the CSAPR compliance dates. Accordingly, CSAPR replaced CAIR on January 1, 2015. On July 28, 2015, the D.C. Circuit held that the EPA had exceeded its authority by requiring certain reductions that were not necessary for downwind states to achieve federal standards. Although the D.C. Circuit kept the rule in place, the court ordered the EPA to revise the Phase 2 (or 2017) (i) SO2 budgets for four states including Texas and (ii) ozone-season NOx budgets for 11 states including Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. On October 26, 2016, the EPA finalized the CSAPR Update Rule, which reduces future NOx allocations and discounts the current banked allowances to account for the more stringent 2008 Ozone NAAQS and to address the D.C. Circuit's July 2015 decision. This rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. The Registrants believe that their investment in pollution controls and cleaner technologies leave the fleet well-positioned for compliance.
MATS — In February 2012, the EPA promulgated standards (the MATS rule) to control emissions of HAPs from coal and oil-fired electric generating units. The rule established limits for mercury, non-mercury metals, certain organics and acid gases, which had to be met beginning in April 2015 (with some units getting a 1-year extension). In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the case of Michigan v. EPA, and held that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs when it determined that it was "appropriate and necessary" to regulate HAPs emitted by electric generating units. The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the MATS rule but rather remanded it to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit remanded the MATS rule to the EPA without vacatur. On April 25, 2016, the EPA released a supplemental finding that the benefits of this regulation outweigh the costs to address the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that the EPA had not properly considered costs. This finding has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. While the Registrants cannot predict the final outcome of this rulemaking, the Registrants believes that because they have already invested in pollution controls and cleaner technologies, the fleet is well-positioned to comply with the MATS rule.
Clean Power Plan — The attention in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal regulations and state legislative and regulatory action. In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, or CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP. The D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, heard oral argument on the legal challenges to the CPP in September 2016. Due to the ongoing litigation and the potential impact of the new U.S. presidential administration, the Registrants believe the CPP is not likely to survive.
Effluent Limitations Guidelines — In November 2015, the EPA revised the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which will impose more stringent requirements (as individual permits are renewed) for wastewater streams from flue gas desulfurization, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control. The Registrants estimate that it would cost approximately $45 million over the next five years to comply with this rule at the Registrants' coal-fired plants. This regulation has been challenged and is subject to legal uncertainty. The change in U.S. presidential administration increases the likelihood that the legal challenges will succeed. The Registrants decide to invest capital for environmental controls based on: the certainty of regulations; evaluation of different technologies; options to convert to gas; and the expected economic returns on the capital. Over the next several years, the Registrants will decide whether to proceed with these investments at each of the plants as permits are renewed based on, among other things, the legal certainty of the regulation and market conditions at that time.

Regional Environmental Issues
RGGI — The Registrants operate generating units in Maryland, Massachusetts and New York that are subject to RGGI, which is a regional cap and trade system. In 2013, each of these states finalized a rule that reduced and will continue to reduce the number of allowances through 2020. The nine RGGI states are re-evaluating the program and may alter the rules to further reduce the number of allowances. The revisions being currently contemplated could adversely impact the Registrants' results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
Massachusetts Global Warming Solutions Act Proposed Regulation — In May 2016, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that Massachusetts DEP had not complied with the 2008 Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires establishing limits for sources of GHGs. The Court held that participation in RGGI was not sufficient. In December 2016, the Massachusetts DEP proposed a regulation that would limit GHG emissions from large electric generating facilities located in Massachusetts.  A final regulation is expected by August 2017.  If promulgated in its current form, the regulation may limit the operations of affected facilities.

New Source Review — The EPA and various states have been investigating compliance of electric generating facilities with the pre-construction permitting requirements of the CAA known as “new source review,” or NSR. In January 2009, GenOn received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Keystone, Portland and Shawville generating stations violated regulations regarding NSR. In June 2011, GenOn received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Avon Lake and Niles generating stations violated NSR. In December 2007, the NJDEP filed suit alleging that NSR violations occurred at the Portland generating station, which suit was resolved pursuant to a July 2013 Consent Decree. 
Environmental Capital Expenditures 
GenOn estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2017 through 2021 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately $61 million for GenOn, which includes $31 million for GenOn Americas Generation. The estimate for GenOn Americas Generation includes $31 million for GenOn Mid-Atlantic. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, GenOn had 1,581 employees of which 580 employees were part of GenOn Americas Generation and 430 employees were part of GenOn Mid-Atlantic, approximately 66.3%, 67.8% and 70.2%, respectively, of whom were covered by bargaining agreements. During 2016, the Registrants did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of their facilities.
