Beacon Merger
 
On May 10, 2013, Beacon and Beacon Acquisition Sub, Inc. a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Beacon (the “Merger Sub”) entered into a merger agreement with Focus (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Merger Sub merged with and into Focus, with Focus continuing as the surviving corporation, with the result that Focus became a subsidiary of Beacon (the “Beacon Merger”). The closing of the merger took place on June 19, 2013.
 
For accounting purposes, the Beacon Merger has been treated as an acquisition of Beacon, and a recapitalization of Focus Venture Partners. The historical consolidated financial statements prior to June 19, 2013 are those of Focus Venture Partners. In connection with the Beacon Merger, Focus Venture Partners has restated its statements of stockholders’ deficiency on a recapitalization basis so that all equity accounts are presented as if the recapitalization had occurred as of the beginning of the earliest period presented.
 
In connection with the Beacon Merger, the Board of Directors authorized the designation of a new series of preferred stock, the Beacon Series D Shares, out of its available “blank check preferred stock” and authorized the issuance of up to 2,000,000 Beacon Series D Shares. We filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on June 17, 2013. Under the Certificate of Designation, each Beacon Series D Share has various rights, privileges and preferences, including: (i) a stated value of $4.00 per share; (ii) mandatory conversion into 20 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustments) upon the filing of the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation after incorporating the 1 for 20 reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of common stock required by the Merger Agreement (and an effective increase in the Company’s authorized common stock); and (iii) a liquidation preference in the amount of the stated value.
 
In connection with the Beacon Merger the Board of Directors authorized the designation of a new series of preferred stock, the Beacon Series E Shares, out of its available “blank check preferred stock” and authorized the issuance of up to 1,000,000 Beacon Series E Shares. We filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on June 17, 2013. Under the Certificate of Designation, each Beacon Series E Share has various rights, privileges and preferences, including (i) a liquidation value of $1.00 per share (subject to adjustments); (ii) mandatory redemption of 10,000 shares per month at the liquidation value; and (iii) conversion at the option of the Company of all outstanding Beacon Series E Shares at a price equal to half the liquidation value after 48 mandatory redemption payments have been made.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement: (i) shares of Series B Preferred Stock of Focus, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Focus Preferred B Shares”) and common stock of Focus, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Focus Common Stock”) were converted into the right to receive an aggregate of 1,250,011 shares of Beacon Series D Preferred Shares, par value $0.01 per share); (ii) all shares of Series A Preferred Stock of Focus, par value $0.0001 per share, were converted into the right to receive an aggregate number of 1,000,000 shares of Beacon Series E shares, par value $0.01 per share, (iii) all shares of capital stock of Merger Sub were converted into one share of Focus Common Stock. Each Beacon Series D and Beacon Series E share is entitled to vote alongside the common stockholders and has 20 and 1 vote(s) each, respectively. The Beacon Series E shares were subject to redemption and were recorded as a liability, but the shares were returned to the Company and derecognized on September 30, 2013. The Beacon Merger represented a change of control of Beacon and Focus management became responsible for the consolidated entity.
 
The consideration issued in the Merger was determined as a result of arm’s length negotiations between the parties.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
The Registration and Trading of Our Securities
 
Prior to September 12, 2014 (the “Revocation Date”), our Common Stock was registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Pursuant to such registration, the Company was subject to the requirements of Regulation 13(a) of the Exchange Act which required us to file with the SEC, in part, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and to comply with all other obligations of the Exchange Act applicable to issuers filing registration statements pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.
 
After we ceased our business operations and became a public company “shell” on September 5, 2012, we fell behind on the compilation of our books and records, due to challenges related to staffing, access to historical data and insufficient funding. Consequently, we failed to comply with the reporting requirements of Regulation 13(a) of the Exchange Act. Further, the Company underestimated the time that it would take for the registrant to access and analyze the historical data to enable it to become current in its financial reporting. As a result, on August 20, 2014, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), via Release No. 72872, ordered the commencement of an Administrative Proceeding (File No. 3-16024) with respect to the Company. The SEC observed and asserted that the Company had failed to comply with its obligations under Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder because the Company had not filed any periodic reports with the SEC since the period ended June 30, 2012. Also on August 20, 2014, in connection with the foregoing, the SEC announced the temporary suspension of trading in the securities of the Company.
 
Subsequently, on September 8, 2014, the Company entered into an Offer of Settlement with the SEC regarding the Administrative Proceeding (File No. 3-16024) whereby, in part, the Company consented to the entry of an Order by the SEC containing the findings that: (1) the Company was a Nevada corporation located in Naples, Florida with a class of securities registered with the Commission under Exchange Act Section 12(g) and as of August 18, 2014, the common stock of the Company (symbol FTNW) was quoted on OTC Link (formerly “Pink Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Inc., had ten market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule15c2-11(f)(3); (2) the Company had failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder because it had not filed any periodic reports with the SEC since the period ended June 30, 2012; and that on the basis of the foregoing (3) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act, registration of each class of the Company’s securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 be revoked.
 
As such, on the Revocation Date, via Release No. 73085, the SEC ordered that, effective immediately pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act, the registration of each class of the Company’s securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 be revoked.
 
Following the above described revocation of registration, on March 17, 2015 we filed a registration statement on Form 10, to once again register our Common Stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. On May 16, 2015, the registration statement became effective, and we are again subject to the requirements of Regulation 13(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires us to file, in part, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and we are required to comply with all other obligations of the Exchange Act applicable to issuers filing registration statements pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.
 
On December 10, 2015, our common stock resumed trading on the OTC Pink marketplace. As of December 31, 2016, our common stock is trading on the OTCQX marketplace.

Authorization of Series F Preferred Stock
 
The Board of Directors of the Company authorized the designation of a new series of preferred stock, the Series F Stock (“Series F Stock”), out of its available “blank check preferred stock” and authorized the issuance of up to 1,980,000 shares of the Series F Stock. A Certificate of Designation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on November 2, 2015. The Series F Stock has various rights, privileges and preferences, including: (i) a stated value of $4.00 per share; (ii) conversion into 20 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustments) upon the filing of an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation incorporating a reverse stock split; and (iii) a liquidation preference in the amount of the stated value.
Entry into a Credit Facility and Repayment of Senior Secured Notes
 
On November 3, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company received $8 million in term loans from Lateral Investment Management (“Lateral”). A portion of the proceeds was used to extinguish an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.4 million of Senior Secured Promissory Notes, pursuant to a tender offer. The noteholders who tendered their notes received the tender offer consideration of $0.50 per $1 principal amount of the Notes from the proceeds from the term loan, and all interest payable on the notes was forgiven. The Company recognized approximately a $3.4 million gain related to the extinguishment of the Senior Secured Promissory Notes.


In connection with the agreement, the Company issued 555,344 shares of preferred stock to Lateral, 163,441 designated as Series D preferred stock and 391,903 designated as Series F preferred stock. Upon the approval of the reverse split of common stock on or about May 26, 2016, these preferred shares mandatorily converted to 11,106,880 shares of common stock, based upon their 1 for 20 conversion rate. The Company and Lateral also entered into a registration rights agreement (“Registration Rights Agreement”) in connection with the issuance of these shares, pursuant to which the Company must file a registration statement with the SEC, with respect to the shares. Lateral may request redemption of some or all of its shares any time after October 28, 2017, subject to the Company (a) meeting certain minimum capitalization and EBITDA requirements; and (b) being able to continue as a going concern on a post-redemption basis. The redemption price per share is variable and equals 10 (ten) times the last twelve months EBITDA, multiplied by the Lateral fully-diluted ownership percentage and then divided by the Lateral shares outstanding. In addition, Lateral was granted anti-dilution rights which permit it to receive additional equity securities to maintain its fully-diluted ownership interest to the extent that the Company issues equity securities to third parties, up to a maximum of $5,000,000. On April 5, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment agreement to its existing credit facility with Lateral, amending the original credit agreement signed October 28, 2015. The agreement amends select provisions of the original credit agreement, including equity raises and changes to certain financial and operational covenants. On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a second amendment agreement to its existing credit facility, maturing October 28, 2017, amending the original credit agreement signed October 28, 2015. The agreement was amended solely to consolidate a series of short term bridge loans granted to the company from time to time during the second and third quarter of 2016 into a 2.5 million loan, which matures on April 30, 2017. The second amendment also amended the covenants related to consolidated EBITDA, consolidated leverage, consolidated debt service, selling, general, and administrative expenses, and compensation expense. On April 20, 2017, in conjunction with the acquisition of Benchmark Builders Inc, Lateral amended the original credit agreement to provide for approximately $10.1 million towards the cash purchase price of the Benchmark acquisition, refinancing this new advance with the existing debt, extending the maturity date of the facility to March 31, 2019.
 
Reverse Split of Common Stock
 
On December 23, 2015, the Board unanimously authorized and approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our Common Stock at a 1-for-20 ratio (the “Reverse Split”). On December 30, 2015, stockholders holding a majority of our voting power approved by written consent the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation, which would affect the Reverse Split. The Reverse Split will reduce the number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock by reclassifying and converting all outstanding shares of our Common Stock into a proportionately fewer number of shares of Common Stock. On March 9, 2016, the Company filed a Form Pre-14C with the SEC concerning the 1 for 20 reverse stock split and the increase of the authorized shares of common stock from 70,000,000 to 200,000,000. On April 18, 2016, the Company filed its Definitive Form 14-C with the SEC. On May 25, 2016 “FINRA” approved the Reverse Split, which was effectuated on May 26, 2016. All share and share information in this transitional report have been retroactively restated for the reverse split.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES INDUSTRY
 
FTE Network Services provides comprehensive telecommunications solutions to Fortune 500 and other customers in the wireline and wireless telecommunications industry. Services performed by FTE include the design, engineering, installation, repair and maintenance of fiber optic, copper and coaxial cable networks used for video, data and voice transmission. In the wireless space, FTE provides engineering, design, installation and upgrade of wireless communications networks, including infrastructure, antennas, switching systems, and backhaul links from wireless systems to voice, data and video networks. FTE also provides emergency restoration services, including the repair of telecommunications infrastructure damaged by inclement weather. We also provide premise wiring where we install, repair, and maintain the telecommunications structure within improved structures.
 
FTE Network Services’ success in these technology spaces is the result of experienced management and leadership, purchasing relationships and logistics, project planning, project management disciplines, training, quality control and top down commitment to customer satisfaction.
 
We believe that certain provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) will continue to create additional demand for our services. Specifically, the ARRA includes federal stimulus funding for the deployment of broadband services to underserved areas that lack sufficient bandwidth to adequately support economic development. We also expect many customers who received stimulus funds to continue to expand their networks even though stimulus funding may no longer be available.
 
The combination of a growing North American wireless subscriber base, greater use of wireless data for consumer and enterprise applications and services, and the development of innovative consumer wireless data products has led to a significant increase in the amount of wireless data traffic on wireless networks. As a result, the traditional backhaul infrastructure that has historically linked wireless cell sites to broader voice, data and video networks is reaching capacity. To handle current and future wireless data traffic demands and to improve wireless network quality and reliability, wireless carriers are implementing plans to replace their legacy backhaul networks based on T-1 lines and circuit switching applications with fiber optic networks, typically referred to as “fiber to the cell site” initiatives. We believe these initiatives will continue several more years before the backhaul system upgrade is completed, resulting in additional opportunities to assist our wireless customers in their fiber to the cell site initiatives.

We anticipate increased long-term opportunities arising from plans by a number of wireless companies to deploy and implement 4G and LTE (Long Term Evolution) and XLTE (Extended Long Term Evolution) technology and networks throughout North America. These technologies are being deployed in the United States using a new spectrum, which effectively requires an entirely new network to be built. As a result, we expect significant capital expenditures will be made over a relatively long period of time as wireless carriers build out their 4G and LTE networks and then augment and optimize their networks for reliability and network quality. We believe wireless carriers are in the very early stages of their 4G and LTE network deployment plans.
 
Fiber to the X (“FTTx”) comprises the many variants of fiber optic access infrastructure. These include fiber to the home (“FTTH”), fiber to the premise (“FTTP”), fiber to the building (“FTTB”), fiber to the node (“FTTN”), and fiber to the curb or cabinet (“FTTC”). GIA announces the release of a comprehensive global report on Fiber Optic Components market. Global market for Fiber Optic Components is projected to reach US$42 billion by the year 2017. Growth will be driven by the continuously growing demand for bandwidth and the ensuing need for fiber-based broadband, robust growth in mobile internet, and stronger FTTx related deployments.
 
Outside Plant Operations
 
Outside Plant Operations (OSP) includes all forms and methods of connecting the nation’s telecommunications infrastructure. Historically this work has been with copper and then coax. Today, it is predominately aerial and buried fiber. FTE builds outside plant for large corporate customers, government entities and private investors.
 
FTE Network Services has scaled to approximately 200+ concurrent crews in multiple geographies representing multiple customers and multiple projects. FTE Network Services’ success is based on several factors:
 

● | Staff construction experience in these markets over many years in the past provides an understanding of the challenges in most every market with respect to local regulations to diverse soil types and rock formations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | FTE has a network of seasoned Project Managers and Construction Managers that it leverages in all markets on all projects. 
● | FTE uses a blend of self-perform and sub-contract that maintains internal quality standards and allows the company to expand operation rapidly and likewise downsize at completion preserving company profitability. 
● | FTE creates a local presence for all projects with local office and warehouse space to run and manage the project and handle materials logistics respectively. 
● | FTE has relationships with major national suppliers for everything from heavy equipment to custom order fiber optic cable. 
● | All contract outside plant operations are fulfilled with a combination of our fleet of aerial trucks, underground plows, directional drills, fiber placement crews, and fiber splicers. 
● | All equipment used on OSP projects is mobile, with dedicated logistics to service these projects as demands change. FTE Network Services can meet any scheduling requirement and accommodate changing demands by calling on its extensive network of strategic partners. 
● | Finally, FTE itself has a broad base of experienced operators and installers dedicated to each project, and we are committed to providing the necessary personnel and equipment to meet the demands of every engagement. 

Inside Plant Operations
 
Inside Plant Operations (ISP) are services provided to major telecommunications services providers in their switching and processing facilities. The scope of services includes the following:
 

● | Cable rack / wiring build-outs 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
● | Infrastructure build-outs 
● | DC power installation 
● | Battery installation / maintenance 
● | Uninterrupted power source (“UPS”) installation 
● | Power distribution unit (“PDU”) installation 
● | Fiber cable splicing 
● | Structured cable installation 
● | All low-voltage cable installation 
● | Provisioning, test, turn-up of FTTP, FTTN, FTTH, FTTx. 
● | Security camera installation 
● | AC circuits & conduit builds 

 
Each major telecommunications client has their own build and quality standards. FTE trains its technicians in each specific protocol and has quality standards that it maintains on each and every project. FTE has the capability to engineer, build, turn up, test and manage every component in a client’s facility. The facilities that we work in performing ISP work are secure, highly available and mission critical to the countries telecommunications infrastructure. The client facilities that FTE works inside of touches everything from Wall Street trading floors to the video, telephone and data services used every day by the typical family and individual. This critical infrastructure connects corporate land based services, mobile data services, on-demand video, TV and cable broadcast, internet, public networks, private networks and telephone. The quality of the work product from engineering to construction in this work is critical.

Our clients engage us with confidence as is shown by our solid, standing relationships and repeat business opportunities that have been tested and forged over time.
 
Project Estimating and Feasibility Studies
 
Our subsidiaries share an estimating department that provides all cost needs, both internal and external, as a value-added service to telecommunications clients. For extremely difficult builds, we use a “boots on the ground” approach, ready with someone to look at the project up close, typically within 24 hours. For the bid process, the following steps are followed:

● | A request for a proposal, or a request for information is received from a prospective customer: typically a data file is provided with a general route, cell tower locations, laterals, rings, etc. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Using Google Earth, we provide a solution based on aerial and underground construction options, utilizing the U.S. geological studies for ground conditions and “street view” programs to analyze the conditions. Additional services are often used, including: MS Streets & Trips, MapInfo, Bing Maps, Delorme, and a national database of GIS maps. At the same time, we reach out to vendors and suppliers to start assessing rough costs for materials and labor. 
● | We specialize in complex projects with a large geographical footprint and multiple customer drop points. This goal is met by importing the customer drop points (i.e., latitude and longitude) into whichever software program the customer has specified as the deliverable. Then, using the aforementioned methods, we identify the best installation path and verify whether the most cost-effective method of installation will be aerial, underground, or existing conduit paths. This conclusion is portrayed on the deliverable software, and the different methods of construction are clearly defined by specific colors on the reports. 
● | The project is broken into segments with independent budgets for each segment, allowing the customer to identify the fiber size based upon end-use requirements. This all flows into a master project budget, giving the customer a snapshot that will allow them to make changes to the individual segments at their discretion based upon the budgetary information provided. 
● | The nationwide network of project managers is utilized to analyze the geography of each part of the project and provide feedback on critical portions of the proposed build. 
● | This all culminates into finished proposals - ones that we believe accurately represent the ideal and most cost-effective approach to the build process. Due to the process, we have solidified in our estimating department, bringing in and training additional support staff typically takes less than 2 weeks. 

Customer Relationships
 
Our current customers include, in part, multiple Fortune 500 telecommunications and technology providers and integrators. We also provide telecommunications engineering, construction, installation and maintenance services to a number of cable television multiple system operators. Premise wiring services are provided to various corporations and state and local governments.
 
Our customer base is concentrated. Due to the fact that the majority of our revenues are non-recurring, project-based revenues, it is not unusual for there to be significant period-to-period shifts in customer concentrations. Revenue may significantly decline if the Company were to lose one or more of its significant customers, or if the Company were not able to obtain new customers upon the completion of significant contract. The Company’s strategy for the future includes customer and service diversification reducing the customer revenue concentration to less than 15% for any single customer.
 
For the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company’s largest customers included a telecommunications company providing fiber optic based network solutions, (Customer C), and a corporate staffing customer within the Company’s staffing segment, (Customer D). During the transitional three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company’s largest customers included a multinational provider of communications technology and services, (Customer I) and a corporate staffing customer within the Company’s staffing segment, (Customer D). For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company’s largest customers included multinational telecommunications conglomerate (Customer M) and leader service provider in network managed and professional services, (Customer J).

Competition
 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with other contractors in most of the geographic markets in which we operate, and several of our competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical and marketing resources. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into some of the industries in which we operate and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. A significant portion of our revenues is currently derived from unit price or fixed price agreements, and price is often an important factor in the award of such agreements. Accordingly, we could be underbid by our competitors in an effort by them to procure such business. Economic conditions have increased the impacts of competitive pricing in certain of the markets that we serve. We believe that customers consider other factors in choosing a service provider, including technical expertise and experience, financial and operational resources, nationwide presence, industry reputation and dependability, which we expect to benefit larger contractors such as us. In addition, competition may lessen as industry resources, such as labor supplies, approach capacity. There can be no assurance, however, that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers, including telecommunications and engineering companies, which employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services as those provided by us. Although a significant portion of these services is currently outsourced by many of our customers, there can be no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource services in the future.
Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations including:
 

● | licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection; 
● | permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects;

We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses, as well as give rise to termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.
 
Safety and Risk Management
 
We are committed to ensuring that our employees perform their work safely and we regularly communicate with our employees to reinforce that commitment and instill safe work habits. We review accidents and claims for our operations, examine trends and implement changes in procedures to address safety issues. Claims arising in our business generally include workers’ compensation claims, various general liability and damage claims, and claims related to vehicle accidents, including personal injury and property damage. We insure against the risk of loss arising from our operations up to certain deductible limits in substantially all of the states in which we operate. In addition, we retain risk of loss, up to certain limits, under our employee group health plan.
 
We carefully monitor claims and actively participate with our insurers in determining claims estimates and adjustments. The estimated costs of claims are accrued as liabilities, including estimates for claims incurred but not reported. Due to fluctuations in our loss experience from year to year, insurance accruals have varied and can affect the consistency of operating margins. If we experience insurance claims in excess of our umbrella coverage limit, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Seasonality
 
Our revenues are affected by seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors. Consequently, our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather. Generally, inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season, which falls during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Also, a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our fourth quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Additionally, our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decrease around calendar year-end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period. As a result, we may experience reduced revenue in the first or fourth quarters of our fiscal years.
Environmental Matters
 
A significant portion of our work is performed underground. As a result, we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to encountering underground objects which may cause the release of hazardous materials or substances. Additionally, the environmental laws and regulations which relate to our business include those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste. These laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the discharge of hazardous materials or substances may include clean-up costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
STAFFING INDUSTRY
 
Effective May 8, 2014, we began operations for a temporary and permanent staffing agency providing full service human capital solutions specializing in telecommunications, construction, engineering and technology through our wholly owned subsidiary, FVP Worx. On December 31, 2016, a strategic decision was made to continue operating the staffing segment but at a reduced scale of operations in order to fully deploy our management’s focus and working capital to our higher margin business in the OSP and ISP segments.
Segment Reporting
 
We operate in the telecommunications infrastructure services industry and, effective May 8, 2014, entered the staffing industry. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our staffing business generated $108,057 in revenues and $126,087 in expenses. For reporting purposes, the Company will continue to report the staff business as a separate segment from the telecommunications services business. We reported segment results pursuant to ASC 280-10 “Segment Reporting” for the year ended December 31, 2016, transitional three months ended December 31, 2015, and the year ended September 30, 2015.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of May 1, 2017, we, together with our subsidiaries, employ 136 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. None of our employees are represented by local collective bargaining units. The number of our employees varies according to the level of our work in progress. We maintain a nucleus of technical and managerial personnel to supervise all projects and add employees as needed to complete specific projects.
ACQUISITION STRATEGY
 
With respect to our acquisition strategy, FTE intends to pursue a clearly defined telecommunications niche, but may, in its discretion, pursue acquisitions outside of this niche, although this will not be our focus. We selectively pursue acquisitions when we believe doing so is operationally and financially beneficial to our existing operations, although we do not rely solely on acquisitions for growth. In particular, we may pursue those acquisitions that we believe will provide us with incremental revenue and geographic diversification while complementing our existing operations. We generally target companies for acquisition that have defensible leadership positions in their market niches, are EBITDA positive, which meet or exceed industry averages, and have proven operating histories, sound management, and certain clearly identifiable cost synergies. On October 28, 2016, the Company signed a non-binding letter of intent (the “LOI”) with Benchmark Builders, Inc. (“Benchmark”) which summarized the principal terms of a possible acquisition of Benchmark, a privately held corporation. On March 9, 2017, the Company, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with (i) Benchmark, and (ii) each of Benchmark’s stockholders. On April 20, 2017, the Company closed on the Purchase Agreement, acquiring 100% of the outstanding shares of Benchmark stock. On April 20, 2017, in conjunction with the acquisition of Benchmark Builders Inc, Lateral amended the original credit agreement to provide for approximately $10.1 million towards the cash purchase price of the Benchmark acquisition, refinancing this new advance with the existing debt, extending the maturity date of the facility to March 31, 2019. See Item 8.
