ITEM 1. Business
 
Prologis, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and is the sole general partner of Prologis, L.P. We operate Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. as one enterprise and, therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to Prologis, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Prologis, L.P., collectively. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsid
iaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors. We maintain a significant level of ownership in these co-investment ventures, which may be consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity.
 
Prologis, Inc. began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Internal Revenue Code”). We believe the current organization and method of operation will enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. Prologis, L.P. was also formed in 1997.
 
We operate our business on an owned and managed basis, including properties that we wholly own and properties that are owned by one of our co-investment ventures. We make decisions based on the property operations, regardless of our ownership interest, therefore we generally evaluate operating metrics on an owned and managed basis.
 
Our corporate headquarters is located at Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111, and our other principal office locations are in Amsterdam, Denver, Luxembourg, Mexico City, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo.
 
Our Internet address is www.prologis.com. All reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are available and can be accessed free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website, www.prologis.com. The common stock of Prologis, Inc. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker “PLD” and is a component of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500.
 
THE COMPANY
 
Prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets in 19 countries. We own, manage and develop well-located, high-quality logistics facilities in the world’s busiest consumption markets. Our local teams actively manage our portfolio, which encompasses leasing and property management, capital deployment and opportunistic dispositions allowing us to recycle capital to fund our development and acquisition activities. The majority of our properties in the United States (“U.S.”) are wholly owned, while our properties outside the U.S. are generally held in co-investment ventures, reducing our exposure to foreign currency movements. 
 
Our portfolio benefits from key drivers of economic activity, including consumption, supply chain modernization, e-commerce and urbanization. In the developed markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, key factors are the reconfiguration of supply chains (strongly influenced by e-commerce trends), and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from our modern logistics facilities. In emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, new affluence and the rise of a new consumer class have increased the need for modern distribution networks. Our strategy is to own the highest-quality logistics property portfolio in each of our target markets. These markets are characterized by large population densities and consumption and typically offer proximity to large labor pools and are supported by extensive transportation infrastructure (major airports, seaports and rail and highway networks). Customers turn to us because they know an efficient supply chain will make their businesses run better, and that a strategic relationship with Prologis will create a competitive advantage.

At December 31, 2017, we owned or had investments in, on a wholly-owned basis or through co-investment ventures, properties and development projects (based on gross book value and total expected investment (“TEI”)), totaling $57.5 billion across 684 million square feet (64 million square meters) across four continents. Our investment totals $32.9 billion and consists of our wholly-owned properties and our pro rata (or ownership) share of the properties owned by our co-investment ventures. We lease modern logistics facilities to a diverse base of approximately 5,000 customers.
 

Throughout this document, we reflect amounts in U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. Included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated into U.S. dollars. We mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the U.S. through co-investment ventures, borrowing in local currency and utilizing derivative financial instruments. At December 31, 2017, 94.4% of our net equity (calculated on a gross book value basis) is denominated in U.S. dollars including our proportionate share of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures and derivative financial instruments.
 
OPERATING SEGMENTS
 
Our business comprises two operating segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital. 
 
 
REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS – RENTAL Generate revenues, net operating income (“NOI”) and cash flows by increasing rents and maintaining high occupancy rates | REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS – DEVELOPMENT Provide significant earnings growth as projects lease up and generate income | STRATEGIC CAPITAL Access third-party capital to grow our business and earn fees and promotes through long-term co-investment ventures

Real Estate Operations
 
Rental. Rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contributes 90% of our consolidated revenues, earnings and funds from operations (“FFO”) (see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information on FFO, a non-GAAP measure). We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. We expect to generate long-term internal growth by increasing rents, maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses. The primary drivers of our rent growth will be rolling in-place leases to current market rents. We believe our active portfolio management, coupled with the skills of our property, leasing, maintenance, capital, energy and risk management teams, will allow us to maximize rental revenues across our portfolio. Most of our rental revenues and NOI are generated in the U.S. NOI from this segment is calculated directly from our financial statements as rental revenues, rental recoveries and development management and other revenues less rental expenses and other expenses.
Development. We develop properties to meet our customers’ needs, deepen our market presence and refresh our portfolio quality. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to (i) the strategic locations of our land bank; (ii) the development expertise of our local teams; and (iii) the depth of our customer relationships. Successful development and redevelopment efforts increase both the rental revenues and the net asset value of our Real Estate Operations segment. We measure the development value we create based on the estimated fair value of a stabilized development property, as compared to the costs incurred. We develop properties in the U.S. for long-term hold or contribution to our unconsolidated co-investment venture and outside the U.S. we develop primarily for contribution to our co-investment ventures. Occasionally, we develop for sale to third parties. 
Strategic Capital 
 
Real estate is a capital-intensive business that requires new capital to grow. Our strategic capital business gives us access to third-party capital, both private and public, allowing us to diversify our sources of capital and providing us with a broad range of options to fund our growth, while reducing our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside the U.S. We partner with some of the world’s largest institutional investors to grow our business and provide incremental revenues, with a focus on long-term and open-ended ventures (also referred to as “perpetual vehicles”). We also access alternative sources of equity through two publicly traded vehicles: Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. in Japan and FIBRA Prologis in Mexico. We hold significant ownership interests in all of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures (approximately 29% weighted average ownership based on each entity’s contribution of total assets, before depreciation, net of other liabilities at December 31, 2017), aligning our interests with those of our partners. 
 
This segment produces stable, long-term cash flows and generally contributes 10% of our consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO. We generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, primarily through asset and property management services, of which 90% are earned from long-term and open-ended ventures. We earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction, development, financing, legal and disposition services. In certain ventures, we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees (“promotes”) periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation. We plan to profitably grow this business by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures. Generally, the majority of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the U.S. NOI in this segment is calculated directly from our financial statements as strategic capital revenues less strategic capital expenses and does not include property-related NOI.
 
FUTURE GROWTH
 
We believe the quality and scale of our global portfolio, the expertise of our team, the depth of our customer relationships, and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages. Our plan to grow revenues, NOI, earnings, FFO and cash flows is based on the following:

• | Rent Growth. We expect market rents to continue to grow over the next few years, driven by demand for the location and quality of our properties. Due to strong market rent growth over the last several years, our in-place leases have considerable upside potential. We estimate that across our owned and managed portfolio, our leases on an aggregate basis are more than 14% below current market rent. Therefore, even if market rents remain flat, a lease renewal will translate into increased future rental income, both on a consolidated basis and through the earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership. This is reflected in the positive rent change on rollover (comparing the net effective rent of the new lease to the prior lease for the same space) in our owned and managed portfolio. We have experienced positive rent change on rollover for every quarter since 2013 and we expect this to continue for several more years. For 2017, our net effective rents increased 15.4% on lease rollover that represented approximately 23% of our owned and managed portfolio.

• | Value Creation from Development. A successful development and redevelopment program involves maintaining control of well-located and entitled land. Based on our current estimates, our land bank, excluding land we have under an option contract, has the potential to support the development of $7.8 billion of TEI of new logistics space. TEI is the total estimated cost of development or expansion, including land, development and leasing costs without depreciation. We believe the carrying value of our land bank is below its current fair value, and we expect to realize this value going forward—primarily through development. During 2017, we stabilized development projects with a TEI of $1.9 billion, and we estimate the value of these buildings to be 28.8% above our cost to develop (defined as estimated margin and calculated using estimated yield and capitalization rates from our underwriting models), while increasing NOI of our operating portfolio.

• | Economies of Scale from Growth in Assets Under Management. We have increased our owned and managed real estate assets by 91 million square feet (or approximately 17%) over the last three years through acquisitions and development, while strengthening our balance sheet and keeping our general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses relatively flat. We have invested in technologies that we will continue to leverage to further streamline our operations and reduce our costs as a percentage of assets under management.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition 
 
Competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge, which in turn could affect our operating segments. We may face competition regarding our capital deployment activities, including local, regional and national operators or developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business.
 
We believe we have competitive advantages due to our:
 
 
• | properties in markets characterized by large population densities and consumption and typically offer proximity to large labor pools and are supported by extensive transportation infrastructure;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to quickly respond to customers’ needs for high-quality logistics facilities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established relationships with key customers served by our local teams;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to leverage our organizational scale and structure to provide a single point of contact for our focus customers through our global customer solutions team;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | property management and leasing expertise;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | relationships and proven track record with current and prospective investors in our strategic capital business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strategic locations of our land bank;
--+--------------------------------------


• | local teams with development expertise; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | balance sheet strength, credit ratings and significant liquidity.

In our Strategic Capital segment, we view our partners and investors as our customers. At December 31, 2017, in our private ventures, we partnered with approximately 100 investors, several of which invest in multiple ventures.
 
Employees 
 
The following table summarizes our employee base at December 31, 2017: 
 
 
Regions | Number of Employees | 
---------------+---------------------+------
U.S. (1) | | 835 
Other Americas | | 130 
Europe | | 370 
Asia | | 230 
Total | | 1,565


(1) | This includes employees who were employed in the U.S. but also support other regions.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We allocate our employees who perform property management functions to our Real Estate Operations segment and Strategic Capital segment based on the square footage of the respective portfolios. Employees who perform only Strategic Capital functions are allocated directly to that segment.
 
We believe we have good relationships with our employees. Prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements, although some employees in Europe are represented by statutory Works Councils and as such, benefit from applicable labor agreements.
 
CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT
 
We maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our board of directors (the “Board”) and all of our officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, and other people performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website, www.prologis.com. In addition to being ac
cessible through our website, copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code 
 7


of Ethics and Business Conduct that apply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, the principal accounting officer, or other people performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will be disclosed on our website.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
INSURANCE COVERAGE
 
We carry insurance coverage on our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self-insurance and a wholly-owned captive insurance entity. The costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through reimbursements from our customers. We believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
