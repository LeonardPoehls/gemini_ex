ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

(a) General Development of Business 
We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership that owns and operates a logistics business, consisting of a geographically diverse portfolio of complementary pipeline, terminalling, and acquisition and marketing assets which are used to facilitate the purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids ("NGLs") and refined products. Sunoco Partners LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company and the general partner of Sunoco Logistics Partners, is a consolidated subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership ("ETP"). The principal executive offices of Sunoco Partners LLC, our general partner, are located at 3807 West Chester Pike, Newtown Square, PA 19073 (telephone (866) 248-4344). Our website address is www.sunocologistics.com. 
During the fourth quarter 2015, we realigned our reporting segments as a result of the continued investment in our organic growth capital program which has served to increase the integration that exists between our assets that service each commodity. This has also resulted in a shift in Management's strategic decision making process, resource allocation methodology, and assessment of our financial results. The updated reporting segments are: Crude Oil, Natural Gas Liquids and Refined Products. The new segmentation provides our investors with a more meaningful view of our business that is consistent with that of Management. For the purpose of comparability, all prior year segment disclosures have been recast to conform to the current year presentation. Such recasts had no impact on previously reported consolidated earnings.
On November 20, 2016, we and our general partner, Sunoco Partners LLC ("SXL GP"), a Pennsylvania limited liability company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with ETP, together with Energy Transfer Partners GP, L.P. ("ETP GP"), a Delaware limited partnership and the general partner of ETP, and, solely for purposes of certain provisions therein, Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. ("ETE"), a Delaware limited partnership and indirect parent entity of ETP, ETP GP, the Partnership and SXL GP. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SXL will merge with ETP (the "Merger"), with ETP continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of SXL. Concurrently with the Merger, SXL GP will merge with ETP GP, with ETP GP continuing as the surviving entity and becoming the general partner of SXL. Following the recommendation of the conflicts committee (the "ETP Conflicts Committee") of the board of directors of ETP's managing general partner (the "ETP Board"), the ETP Board approved and agreed to submit the Merger Agreement to a vote of ETP unitholders and to recommend that ETP's unitholders adopt the Merger Agreement. Following the recommendation of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of SXL GP, the board of directors of SXL GP approved the Merger Agreement. The Merger is expected to close in April 2017.
Effective at the time of the Merger, all SXL units, 67.1 million common and 9.4 million Class B, currently held by ETP will be retired. The existing incentive distribution right ("IDR") provisions in the SXL Partnership Agreement will continue to be in effect, and ETE will own the IDRs of SXL following the closing of the transaction. As part of this transaction, ETE has agreed to continue to provide all the IDR subsidies that are currently in effect for both SXL and ETP. In addition, our 364-Day credit facility is expected to be terminated and repaid in connection with the Merger. Also effective at the time of the Merger, each common unit representing a limited partner interest in ETP issued and outstanding or deemed issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive 1.50 common units representing limited partner interests in SXL (the "SXL Common Units") (the "Merger Consideration"). Each Class E Unit of ETP, each Class G Unit of ETP, each Class I Unit of ETP, each Class J Unit of ETP and each Class K Unit of ETP, if any, issued and outstanding or deemed issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive a corresponding unit in SXL with the same rights, preferences, privileges, powers, duties and obligations as such existing ETP unit had immediately prior to the Merger. The corresponding units in SXL will be issued pursuant to the Fourth Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement of Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P., which will be executed at the effective time.

(c) Narrative Description of Business
We are a Delaware limited partnership which is principally engaged in the transport, terminalling and storage of crude oil, NGLs and refined products. In addition to logistics services, we also own acquisition and marketing assets which are used to facilitate the purchase and sale of crude oil, NGLs and refined products. Our portfolio of geographically diverse assets earns revenues in 37 states located throughout the United States. Our reporting segments are as follows:

• | The Crude Oil segment provides transportation, terminalling and acquisition and marketing services to crude oil markets throughout the southwest, midwest and northeast United States. Included within the segment is approximately 6,100 miles of crude oil trunk and gathering pipelines in the southwest and midwest United States and equity ownership interests in two crude oil pipelines. Our crude oil terminalling services operate with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 33 million barrels, including approximately 26 million barrels at our Gulf Coast terminal in Nederland, Texas, approximately 3 million barrels at our Fort Mifflin terminal complex in Pennsylvania and approximately 2 million barrels at our newly acquired Midland, Texas terminal. Our crude oil acquisition and marketing activities utilize our pipeline and terminal assets, our proprietary fleet of crude oil tractor trailers and truck unloading facilities, as well as third-party assets, to service crude oil markets principally in the mid-continent United States.


• | The Natural Gas Liquids segment transports, stores, and executes acquisition and marketing activities utilizing a complementary network of pipelines, storage and blending facilities, and strategic off-take locations that provide access to multiple NGLs markets. The segment contains approximately 900 miles of NGLs pipelines, primarily related to our Mariner systems located in the northeast and southwest United States. Terminalling services are facilitated by approximately 5 million barrels of NGLs storage capacity, including approximately 1 million barrels of storage at our Nederland, Texas terminal facility and 3 million barrels at our Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania terminal facility (the "Marcus Hook Industrial Complex"). This segment also carries out our NGLs blending activities, including utilizing our patented butane blending technology.


• | The Refined Products segment provides transportation and terminalling services, through the use of approximately 1,800 miles of refined products pipelines and approximately 40 active refined products marketing terminals. Our marketing terminals are located primarily in the northeast, midwest and southwest United States, with approximately 8 million barrels of refined products storage capacity. The Refined Products segment includes our Eagle Point facility in New Jersey, which has approximately 6 million barrels of refined products storage capacity. The segment also includes our equity ownership interests in four refined products pipeline companies. The segment also performs terminalling activities at our Marcus Hook Industrial Complex. The Refined Products segment utilizes our integrated pipeline and terminalling assets, as well as acquisition and marketing activities, to service refined products markets in several regions of the United States.

Our primary business strategies focus on generating stable cash flows, increasing pipeline and terminal throughput, utilizing our acquisition and marketing assets to maximize value, pursuing economically accretive organic growth opportunities and improving operational efficiencies. We believe that the effective execution of these strategies will result in continued increases in distributions to our unitholders.
We continue to expand our business with the November 2016 purchase of Vitol Inc.'s ("Vitol") crude oil assets in the Midland basin, commencement of operations on several organic growth projects related to our three commodity strategies, and continued capital investment in our equity ownership interests in crude oil pipeline projects, which provide connectivity with our existing pipeline and terminalling assets upon commencement of operations. We also continued to expand our NGLs platform with continued progress on the previously announced Mariner projects. 
We are subject to competition from third parties in all of our operations. In addition, our businesses make use of a portfolio of complementary crude oil, NGLs and refined products pipelines, terminalling, and acquisition and marketing assets. While this integration creates opportunities and synergies within our operations, assets are sometimes repurposed among our business lines to maximize their utility and profitability. We will continue to utilize our assets in a manner that favors our consolidated results.

Crude Oil 
Our Crude Oil segment consists of an integrated set of pipeline, terminalling, and acquisition and marketing assets that service the movement of crude oil from producers to end-user markets.
We completed the following transactions in the Crude Oil segment since December 31, 2011:

• | In November 2016, we acquired an integrated crude oil business in West Texas from Vitol. The acquisition provides us with an approximately 2 million barrel crude oil terminal in Midland, Texas, a crude oil gathering and mainline pipeline system in the Midland Basin, including a significant acreage dedication from an investment-grade Permian producer, and crude oil inventories related to Vitol crude oil purchasing and marketing business in West Texas. The acquisition also included the purchase of a 50 percent interest in the SunVit Pipeline LLC ("SunVit"), which increased our overall ownership of SunVit to 100 percent. SunVit connects the Midland terminal to our Permian Express 2 pipeline, a key takeaway to bring Permian crude oil to multiple markets. SunVit was renamed Permian Express Terminal LLC ("PET") in December 2016.


• | In October 2015, we obtained a 30 percent ownership interest in the Bakken pipeline project through acquisition of an ownership interest in the Bakken Holdings Company LLC. The Bakken pipeline consists of existing and newly constructed pipelines that are expected to provide aggregate takeaway capacity of approximately 450 thousand barrels per day ("bpd") of crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to key refinery and terminalling hubs in the midwest and Gulf Coast, including our Nederland terminal. The ultimate takeaway capacity target for the Bakken pipeline is 570 thousand bpd. The project is jointly owned by ETP and Phillips 66. Commercial operations are expected to commence in the second quarter 2017.

In February 2017, ETP and Sunoco Logistics completed the sale of a 36.75 percent interest in the Bakken Pipeline project for $2 billion in cash to MarEn Bakken Company LLC, an entity jointly owned by Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. and MPLX LP. Sunoco Logistics received $800 million for its interest, and proceeds from the sale were used to pay down debt and will be used to help fund our expansion capital program. As a result of the sale, our interest in the Bakken Pipeline project is 15.3 percent.

• | In July 2015, we obtained a 30 percent ownership interest in the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, LLC ("Bayou Bridge"), which consists of newly constructed pipeline that delivers crude oil from Nederland, Texas to refinery markets in Louisiana. Commercial operations from Nederland, Texas to Lake Charles, Louisiana commenced in the second quarter 2016, with continued progress on an extension of the pipeline segment to St. James, Louisiana, which is expected to commence operations in the fourth quarter 2017. The Bayou Bridge pipeline is a joint project with ETP and Phillips 66, and we are the operator of the pipeline.


• | In December 2014 and January 2015, we acquired an additional 39.7 percent ownership interest in the West Texas Gulf Pipe Line Company ("West Texas Gulf") which originates in Colorado City and delivers to destinations in Goodrich and Longview, Texas. The acquisition resulted in a wholly-owned interest in this strategic crude oil pipeline.


• | In May 2014, we acquired a crude oil purchasing and marketing business from EDF Trading North America, LLC ("EDF"). The purchase consisted of a crude oil acquisition and marketing business and related assets which handle 20 thousand bpd. The acquisition included a promissory note that was convertible to an equity interest in the Price River Terminal rail facility.


• | In May 2014, we acquired a 55 percent economic and voting interest in Price River Terminal, LLC ("PRT"), a rail facility in Wellington, Utah. As the Partnership acquired a controlling financial interest in PRT, the entity is reflected as a consolidated subsidiary of the Partnership from the acquisition date. The terms of the acquisition provide PRT's noncontrolling interest holders the option to sell their interests to the Partnership at a price defined in the purchase agreement.

In February 2017, we formed Permian Express Partners LLC ("PEP"), a strategic joint venture, with ExxonMobil. We contributed our Permian Express 1, Permian Express 2 and Permian Longview and Louisiana Access pipelines. ExxonMobil contributed its Longview to Louisiana and Pegasus pipelines; Hawkins gathering system; an idle pipeline in southern Oklahoma; and its Patoka, Illinois terminal. Our ownership percentage, upon formation, is approximately 85 percent. Upon commencement of operations on the Bakken pipeline, we will contribute our investment in the project, with a corresponding increase in our ownership percentage in PEP. We maintain a controlling financial and voting interest in PEP and are the operator of all of the assets contributed to the joint venture. As such, PEP will be reflected as a consolidated subsidiary of our operating results, included within the Crude Oil segment. ExxonMobil's interest will be reflected as a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheets.

Crude Oil Pipelines
The crude oil pipelines consist of approximately 6,100 miles of crude oil trunk and gathering pipelines in the southwest and midwest United States, including our wholly-owned interests in West Texas Gulf and PET, and a controlling financial interest in Mid-Valley Pipeline Company ("Mid-Valley"). Additionally, we have equity ownership interests in two crude oil pipelines. Our pipelines provide access to several trading hubs, including the largest trading hub for crude oil in the United States located in Cushing, Oklahoma, and other trading hubs located in Midland, Colorado City and Longview, Texas. Our crude oil pipelines also deliver to and connect with other pipelines that deliver crude oil to a number of refineries.
Revenues throughout our crude oil pipeline systems are generated from tariffs paid by shippers utilizing our transportation services. These tariffs are filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") and other state regulatory agencies, as applicable.
The table below summarizes the average daily number of barrels of crude oil and other feedstocks transported on our crude oil pipelines in each of the years presented:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
Crude oil pipelines throughput (thousands of bpd) (1) (2) | 2,423 | | 2,225 | | 2,125


(1) | Prior period pipeline throughput amounts have been restated to conform to current presentation.


(2) | Excludes amounts attributable to equity ownership interests which are not consolidated. Throughputs related to the acquisition from Vitol have been included from the acquisition date.

Southwest United States Pipelines
Our southwest pipelines include crude oil trunk pipelines and crude oil gathering pipelines in Texas and Oklahoma. This includes our Permian Express 2 pipeline project which provides takeaway capacity from the Permian Basin, with origins in multiple locations in Western Texas: Midland, Garden City and Colorado City. With an initial capacity of approximately 200 thousand barrels per day, Permian Express 2 began delivery to multiple refiners and markets in the third quarter 2015. Our fourth quarter 2016 acquisition of a West Texas crude oil system from Vitol and the remaining ownership interest in PET facilitates connection of our Permian Express 2 pipeline to terminal assets in Midland and Garden City, Texas. 
In the third quarter 2016, we commenced operations on the Delaware Basin Extension and Permian Longview and Louisiana Extension pipeline projects. The Delaware Basin Extension pipeline project provides shippers with new takeaway capacity from the rapidly growing Delaware Basin area in New Mexico and West Texas to Midland, Texas. The project has initial capacity to transport approximately 100 thousand barrels per day. The Permian Longview and Louisiana Extension pipeline project provides takeaway capacity for approximately 100 thousand additional barrels per day out of the Permian Basin at Midland, Texas to be transported to the Longview, Texas area as well as destinations in Louisiana utilizing a combination of our proprietary crude oil system as well as third party pipelines. 
We own and operate crude oil pipeline and gathering systems in Oklahoma. We have the ability to deliver substantially all of the crude oil gathered on our Oklahoma system to Cushing. We are one of the largest purchasers of crude oil from producers in the state, and our crude oil acquisition and marketing activities business is the primary shipper on our Oklahoma crude oil system. 
Midwest United States Pipelines
We own a controlling financial interest in the Mid-Valley pipeline system which originates in Longview, Texas and passes through Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio, and terminates in Samaria, Michigan. This pipeline provides crude oil to a number of refineries, primarily in the midwest United States.
In addition, we own a crude oil pipeline that runs from Marysville, Michigan to Toledo, Ohio, and a truck injection point for local production at Marysville. This pipeline receives crude oil from the Enbridge Mainline Pipeline system for delivery to refineries located in Toledo, Ohio and to Marathon's Samaria, Michigan tank farm, which supplies its refinery in Detroit, Michigan.

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
Crude oil terminals throughput (thousands of bpd) (1) | 1,552 | | 1,401 | | 1,403

(1)     Throughput related to the Vitol acquisition has been included from the acquisition date.
Nederland 
The Nederland terminal, located on the Sabine-Neches waterway between Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, is a large marine terminal providing storage and distribution services for refiners and other large transporters of crude oil and NGLs. The terminal receives, stores, and distributes crude oil and bunker oils (used for fueling ships and other marine vessels), and has a total crude oil storage capacity of approximately 26 million barrels in approximately 150 aboveground storage tanks with individual capacities of up to 660 thousand barrels.
The Nederland terminal can receive crude oil at each of its five ship docks and four barge berths. The five ship docks are capable of receiving over 2 million barrels of crude oil per day. In addition to our crude oil pipelines, the terminal can also receive crude oil through a number of third-party pipelines, including the Department of Energy ("DOE"). The DOE pipelines connect the terminal to the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve's West Hackberry caverns at Hackberry, Louisiana and Big Hill near Winnie, Texas, which have an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 395 million barrels.
The Nederland terminal can deliver crude oil via pipeline, barge and ship. The terminal has two ship docks and three barge berths that are capable of delivering crude oils for international transport. In total, the terminal is capable of delivering over 2 million barrels of crude oil per day to our crude oil pipelines or a number of third-party pipelines, including the DOE. The Nederland terminal generates crude oil revenues primarily by providing term or spot storage services and throughput capabilities to a number of customers.
Fort Mifflin 
The Fort Mifflin terminal complex is located on the Delaware River in Philadelphia and includes the Fort Mifflin terminal, the Hog Island wharf, the Darby Creek tank farm and connecting pipelines. Revenues are generated at the Fort Mifflin terminal complex by charging fees based on throughput. 
The Fort Mifflin terminal contains two ship docks with freshwater drafts and a total storage capacity of approximately 570 thousand barrels. Crude oil enters the Fort Mifflin terminal primarily from marine vessels on the Delaware River. One Fort Mifflin dock is designed to handle crude oil from very large crude carrier-class ("VLCC") tankers and smaller crude oil vessels. The other dock can accommodate only smaller crude oil vessels.
The Hog Island wharf is located next to the Fort Mifflin terminal on the Delaware River and receives crude oil via two ship docks, one of which can accommodate crude oil tankers and smaller crude oil vessels, and the other of which can accommodate some smaller crude oil vessels.
The Darby Creek tank farm is a crude oil storage terminal for the Philadelphia refinery, which is operated by Philadelphia Energy Solutions ("PES") under a joint venture with an affiliate of ETP. This facility has a total storage capacity of approximately 3 million barrels. Darby Creek receives crude oil from the Fort Mifflin terminal and Hog Island wharf via our pipelines. The tank farm then stores the crude oil and transports it to the Philadelphia refinery via our pipelines.
Eagle Point 
The Eagle Point terminal is located in Westville, New Jersey and consists of docks, truck loading facilities and a tank farm. The docks are located on the Delaware River and can accommodate three marine vessels (ships or barges) to receive and deliver crude oil to outbound ships and barges. The tank farm has a total active crude oil storage capacity of approximately 1 million barrels and can receive crude oil via barge and rail, and deliver via barge, providing customers with access to various markets. The terminal generates revenue primarily by charging fees based on throughput, blending services and storage. 
Midland
The Midland terminal is located in Midland, Texas and was acquired in November 2016 from Vitol. The facility includes approximately 2 million barrels of crude oil storage, a combined 14 lanes of truck loading and unloading, and will provide access to the Permian Express 2 transportation system.

Crude Oil Acquisition and Marketing
These activities include the acquisition and marketing of crude oil, primarily in the mid-continent United States. The operations are conducted using our assets, which include approximately 370 crude oil transport trucks and approximately 150 crude oil truck unloading facilities, as well as third-party truck, rail and marine assets. Specifically, our crude oil acquisition and marketing activities include:

• | purchasing crude oil at both the wellhead from producers, and in bulk from aggregators at major pipeline interconnections and trading locations;


• | storing inventory during contango market conditions (when the price of crude oil for future delivery is higher than current prices);


• | buying and selling crude oil of different grades, at different locations in order to maximize value;


• | transporting crude oil using our pipelines, terminals and trucks or, when necessary or cost effective, pipelines, terminals or trucks owned and operated by third parties; and


• | marketing crude oil to major integrated oil companies, independent refiners and resellers through various types of sale and exchange transactions.

The crude oil acquisition and marketing activities generate substantial revenue and cost of products sold as a result of the significant volume of crude oil bought and sold. While the absolute price levels of crude oil significantly impact revenue and cost of products sold, such price levels normally do not bear a relationship to gross profit. As a result, period-to-period variations in revenue and cost of products sold are not generally meaningful in analyzing the variation in gross profit for the crude oil acquisition and marketing activities. The operating results are dependent on our ability to sell crude oil at a price in excess of our aggregate cost. Our operations are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for crude oil and relative fluctuations in market-related indices. Generally, we expect a base level of earnings from our crude oil acquisition and marketing activities that may be optimized and enhanced when there is a high level of market volatility, favorable basis differentials, and/or a steep contango or backwardated structure. Although we implement risk management processes to provide general stability in our margins, these margins are not fixed and will vary from period to period.
We mitigate most of our pricing risk on purchase contracts by selling crude oil for an equal term on a similar pricing basis. We also mitigate most of our volume risk by entering into sales agreements, generally at the same time that purchase agreements are executed, at similar volumes. As a result, volumes sold are generally equal to volumes purchased. We do not acquire and hold futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes, as these activities could expose us to significant losses.
In November 2016, we purchased a crude oil acquisition and marketing business from Vitol, with operations based in the Permian Basin, Texas. Included in the acquisition was a significant acreage dedication from an investment-grade Permian producer.
Crude Oil Purchases and Exchanges
In a typical producer's operation, crude oil flows from the wellhead to a separator where the petroleum gases are removed. After separation, the producer treats the crude oil to remove water, sediment, and other contaminants and then moves it to an on-site storage tank. When the tank is full, the producer contacts our field personnel to purchase and transport the crude oil to market. The crude oil in the producer's tanks is then either delivered directly or transported via truck to our pipeline or to a third-party pipeline. The trucking services are performed either by our truck fleet or a third-party trucking operation.
Crude oil purchasers who buy from producers compete on the basis of price and the ability to provide highly responsive services. Our management believes that our ability to offer competitive pricing and high-quality field and administrative services to producers is a key factor in our ability to maintain our volume of lease purchased crude oil and to obtain new volume.
We also enter into exchange agreements to enhance margins throughout the acquisition and marketing process. When opportunities arise to increase our margin or to acquire a grade of crude oil that more nearly matches our delivery requirements or the preferences of our refinery customers, we exchange our physical crude oil with third parties. Generally, we enter into exchanges to acquire crude oil of a desired quality in exchange for a common grade crude oil or to acquire crude oil at locations that are closer to our end markets, thereby reducing transportation costs.
Generally, we enter into contracts with producers at market prices for a term of one year or less, with a majority of the transactions on a 30-day renewable basis. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased approximately 316 thousand barrels per day, from approximately 3 thousand producers, who operate approximately 60 thousand active leases. We also undertook 562 thousand barrels per day of exchanges and bulk purchases during the same period.

The following table shows our average daily volume for crude oil lease purchases and sales, and other exchanges and bulk purchases in each of the years presented: 

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
 | (in thousands of bpd) 
Lease purchases: | | | | 
Available for sale | 310 | | 361 | | 378
Exchanged | 6 | | 4 | | 14 
Other exchanges and bulk purchases | 562 | | 491 | | 481
Total Purchases | 878 | | 856 | | 873
Bulk Sales | 438 | | 471 | | 483
Exchanges: | | | |

Other | 428 | | 369 | | 372
Total Sales | 872 | | 844 | | 869

Crude oil commodity prices have historically been volatile and cyclical. Profitability from our acquisition and marketing activities is dependent on our ability to sell crude oil at prices in excess of our aggregate cost. Our operations are not directly affected by the absolute level of crude oil prices, but are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for crude oil and relative fluctuations in market-related indices. Generally, we expect a base level of earnings from our acquisition and marketing activities, which may be optimized and enhanced when there is a high level of market volatility. Integration between our crude oil acquisition and marketing assets, pipelines, and terminal facilities allows us to further improve upon earnings during periods when there are favorable basis differentials between various types of products. Additionally, we are able to increase our base level of earnings when there is a steep contango or backwardated market structure.
During periods when supply exceeds the demand for crude oil in the near term, the market for crude oil is often in contango, meaning that the price of crude oil for future deliveries is higher than the price for current deliveries. A contango market generally has a negative impact on our lease gathering margins, but is favorable to commercial strategies associated with tankage. Access to our crude oil storage facilities during a contango market allows us to improve our lease gathering margins by simultaneously purchasing crude oil inventories at current prices for storage and selling forward at higher prices for future delivery.
When there is a higher demand than supply of crude oil in the near term, the market is backwardated, meaning that the price of crude oil for future deliveries is lower than the price for current deliveries. A backwardated market has a positive impact on our lease gathering margins because crude oil gatherers can capture a premium for prompt deliveries. In this environment, there is little incentive to store crude oil, as current prices are above delivery prices in the futures markets. In a backwardated market, increased lease gathering margins provide an offset to reduced use of storage capacity.
The periods between a backwardated market and a contango market are referred to as transition periods. Depending on the overall duration of these transition periods, how we have allocated our assets to particular strategies and the time length of our crude oil purchase and sale contracts and storage lease agreements, these transition periods may have either an adverse or beneficial effect on our aggregate segment profit. A prolonged transition from a backwardated market to a contango market, or vice versa (essentially, a market without pronounced backwardation or contango), represents the most difficult environment for our marketing activities.
Crude Oil Trucking
We own approximately 150 crude oil truck unloading facilities in the mid-continent United States with the majority located on our pipeline systems. Approximately 610 crude oil truck drivers are employed by an affiliate of our general partner and we own and operate a proprietary fleet of approximately 370 crude oil transport trucks. The crude oil truck drivers pick up crude oil at producer sites and transport it to both our truck unloading facilities and third-party unloading facilities for shipment on our pipelines and third-party pipelines. Third-party trucking firms are also retained to transport crude oil to certain facilities.

Natural Gas Liquids 
Our Natural Gas Liquids segment transports, stores, and executes acquisition and marketing activities utilizing an integrated network of pipeline assets, storage and blending facilities, and strategic off-take locations that provide access to multiple NGL markets.
Since December 31, 2011, we completed the following acquisitions in our Natural Gas Liquids segment:

• | In April 2013, we acquired Sunoco's Marcus Hook Industrial Complex and related assets. The acquisition included terminalling and storage assets with a capacity of approximately 2 million barrels of NGLs storage capacity in underground caverns.

NGLs Pipelines
This segment includes approximately 900 miles of NGLs pipelines, primarily related to our Mariner systems in the northeast and southwest United States.
The table below summarizes the average daily number of barrels of NGLs transported on our pipelines in each of the years presented:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
NGLs pipelines throughput (thousands of bpd) | 277 | | 209 | | 33

Our Mariner East project transports NGLs from the Marcellus and Utica Shale areas in Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Eastern Ohio to destinations in Pennsylvania, including our Marcus Hook Industrial Complex on the Delaware River, where they are processed, stored and distributed to local, domestic and waterborne markets. The first phase of the project, referred to as Mariner East 1, consists of interstate and intrastate propane and ethane service and commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2016, respectively. The second phase of the project, referred to as Mariner East 2, will expand the total takeaway capacity to 345 thousand barrels per day for interstate and intrastate propane, ethane and butane service, and is expected to commence operations in the third quarter 2017. 
In the fourth quarter 2014, we commenced operations on the Mariner South pipeline. The Mariner South pipeline is part of a joint project with Lone Star NGL LLC ("Lone Star") to deliver export-grade propane and butane products from Lone Star's Mont Belvieu, Texas storage and fractionation complex to our marine terminal in Nederland, Texas. The pipeline has a capacity of approximately 200 thousand barrels per day and can be scaled depending on shipper interest. 
The Mariner West pipeline provides transportation of ethane products from the Marcellus Shale processing and fractionating areas in Houston, Pennsylvania to Marysville, Michigan and the Canadian border. Mariner West commenced operations in the fourth quarter 2013, with capacity to transport approximately 50 thousand barrels per day of NGLs and other products. 
Revenues on our NGLs pipelines are generated from tariffs paid by shippers utilizing our transportation services. These tariffs are filed with FERC and other state and Canadian regulatory agencies, as applicable. 
NGLs Terminals
Our NGLs terminals generate revenue primarily by charging fees based on throughput, blending services and storage. 
The table below summarizes the total average daily throughput for our NGLs terminals in each of the years presented:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
NGLs terminals throughput (thousands of bpd) | 235 | | 184 | | 40

Nederland 
In addition to crude oil activities, the Nederland terminal also provides approximately 1 million barrels of storage and distribution services for NGLs in connection with the Mariner South pipeline, which provides transportation of propane and butane products from the Mont Belvieu region to the Nederland terminal, where such products can be delivered via ship.

Marcus Hook Industrial Complex
We acquired the Marcus Hook Industrial Complex from an affiliated entity in the second quarter 2013. The acquisition included terminalling and storage assets, with a capacity of approximately 3 million barrels of NGL storage capacity in underground caverns, and related commercial agreements. The facility can receive NGLs via marine vessel, pipeline, truck and rail, and can deliver via marine vessel, pipeline and truck. In addition to providing NGLs storage and terminalling services to both affiliates and third-party customers, the Marcus Hook Industrial Complex currently serves as an off-take outlet for our Mariner East 1 pipeline, and will provide similar off-take capabilities for the Mariner East 2 pipeline when it commences operations. 
Inkster
The Inkster terminal, located near Detroit, Michigan, consists of multiple salt caverns with a total storage capacity of approximately 1 million barrels of NGLs. We use the Inkster terminal's storage in connection with our Toledo North pipeline system and for the storage of NGLs from local producers and a refinery in Western Ohio. The terminal can receive and ship by pipeline in both directions and has a truck loading and unloading rack.
NGLs Acquisition & Marketing
Our NGLs acquisition and marketing activities include the acquisition, blending, marketing and selling of such products at our various terminals and third-party facilities. Since the acquisition of our butane blending business in 2010, we have continued to expand our butane blending service platform by installing our blending technology at certain of our terminals and third-party facilities, as well as the continued development of the Marcus Hook Industrial Complex. The operating results of our NGLs acquisition and marketing activities are dependent on our ability to execute sales in excess of the aggregate cost, and therefore we structure our acquisition and marketing operations to optimize the sources and timing of purchases and minimize the transportation and storage costs. In order to manage exposure to volatility in the price of NGLs, our policy is to (i) only purchase products for which sales contracts have been executed or for which ready markets exist, (ii) structure sales contracts so that price fluctuations do not materially impact the margins earned, and (iii) not acquire and hold physical inventory, futures contracts or other derivative instruments for the purpose of speculating on commodity price changes. However, we do utilize a seasonal hedge program involving swaps, futures and other derivative instruments to mitigate the risk associated with unfavorable market movements in the price of NGLs products. These derivative contracts act as a hedging mechanism against the volatility of prices.

Refined Products 
Our Refined Products segment provides transportation and terminalling services using an integrated network of pipeline assets and refined products terminals, which are also utilized to facilitate acquisition and marketing activities. The segment also includes equity ownership interests in four refined products pipelines. 
Since December 31, 2011, we completed the following acquisitions in our Refined Products segment:

• | In March 2014 and August 2016, we exercised rights to acquire additional 3.9 and 1.7 percent ownership interests, respectively, in Explorer Pipeline Company ("Explorer"), increasing our overall ownership interest from 9.4 to 15.0 percent as a result of the transactions.

Refined Products Pipelines
We own and operate approximately 1,800 miles of refined products pipelines in several regions of the United States. The pipelines primarily provide transportation in the northeast, midwest, and southwest United States markets. The segment includes our controlling financial interest in Inland.
The mix of products delivered varies seasonally, with gasoline demand peaking during the summer months, and demand for heating oil and other distillate fuels peaking in the winter. In addition, weather conditions in the areas served by our refined products pipelines affect both the demand for, and the mix of, the refined products delivered through the pipelines, although historically, any overall impact on the total volume shipped has been short-term.
The products transported in these pipelines include multiple grades of gasoline and middle distillates, such as heating oil, diesel and jet fuel. Rates for shipments on our products pipelines are regulated by the FERC and other state regulatory agencies, as applicable.
During the first quarter 2015, we commenced operations on the Allegheny Access pipeline project, which transports refined products from the midwest to eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania markets at a capacity of up to 85 thousand barrels per day with the possibility to increase capacity to meet further demands.
The following table shows the average shipments on the refined products pipelines system in each of the years presented: 
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
Refined products pipelines throughput (thousands of bpd) (1) (2) | 599 | | 518 | | 481


(1) | Excludes amounts attributable to equity ownership interests which are not consolidated.


(2) | Prior period pipeline throughput amounts have been restated to conform to current presentation.

In addition to our consolidated pipeline assets, we own equity interests in several common carrier refined products pipelines, summarized in the following table: 

Pipeline | SXL Equity Ownership | Approximate Pipeline Mileage
Explorer Pipeline Company (1) | 15.0% | 1,850 
Yellowstone Pipe Line Company (2) | 14.0% | 700 
West Shore Pipe Line Company (3) | 17.1% | 650 
Wolverine Pipe Line Company (4) | 31.5% | 700 


(1) | The system, which is operated by Explorer employees, originates from the refining centers of Beaumont, Port Arthur and Houston, Texas, and extends to Chicago, Illinois, with delivery points in the Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Tulsa, St. Louis, and Chicago areas. Explorer charges market-based rates for all its tariffs.


(2) | The system, which is operated by Phillips 66, originates from the Billings, Montana refining center and extends to Moses Lake, Washington, with delivery points along the way. Tariff rates are regulated by the FERC for interstate shipments and the Montana Public Service Commission for intrastate shipments in Montana.


(3) | The system, which is operated by Buckeye Partners, L.P., originates from the Chicago, Illinois refining center and extends to Madison and Green Bay, Wisconsin, with delivery points along the way. West Shore charges market-based tariff rates in the Chicago area.


(4) | The system, which is operated by Wolverine employees, originates from Chicago, Illinois and extends to Detroit, Grand Haven and Bay City, Michigan, with delivery points along the way. Wolverine charges market-based rates for tariffs at the Detroit, Jackson, Niles, Hammond and Lockport destinations.

Refined Products Terminals
Our active refined products terminals receive refined products from pipelines, barges, railcars, and trucks and distribute them to third parties and certain of our affiliates, who in turn deliver them to end-users and retail outlets. Terminals play a key role in moving product to the end-user markets by providing the following services: storage; distribution; blending to achieve specified grades of gasoline and middle distillates; and other ancillary services that include the injection of additives and the filtering of jet fuel. These terminals facilitate the movement of refined products to or from storage or transportation systems, such as a pipeline, to other transportation systems, such as trucks or other pipelines. Of our approximately 40 refined products terminals, each facility typically consists of multiple storage tanks and is equipped with automated truck loading equipment that is operational 24 hours a day. This automated system provides controls over allocations, credit, and carrier certification.
Our refined products terminals derive revenues from terminalling fees paid by customers. A fee is charged for receiving products into the terminal and delivering them to trucks, barges, or pipelines. In addition to terminalling fees, our refined products terminals generate revenues by charging customers fees for blending services, including certain ethanol and biodiesel blending, injecting additives, and filtering jet fuel. Our refined products pipelines provide supply to the majority of our refined products terminals, with third-party pipelines and barges supplying the remainder.
The table below summarizes the total average daily throughput for the refined products terminals in each of the years presented:  
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
Refined products terminals throughput (thousands of bpd) | 557 | | 534 | | 497

The following table outlines the number of active refined products marketing terminals and storage capacity by state:

State | Number of Terminals | Storage Capacity 
 | | (thousands of barrels)
Indiana | 1 | | 206 
Louisiana | 1 | | 162 
Maryland | 1 | | 709 
Massachusetts | 1 | | 1,204
Michigan | 3 | | 744 
New Jersey | 3 | | 652 
New York (1) | 4 | | 1,009
Ohio | 7 | | 1,001
Pennsylvania | 13 | | 1,500
Texas | 4 | | 550 
Virginia | 1 | | 406 
Total | 39 | | 8,143


(1) | We have a 45 percent ownership interest in a terminal at Inwood, New York and a 50 percent ownership interest in a terminal that we operate in Syracuse, New York. The storage capacities included in the table represent the proportionate share of capacity attributable to our ownership interests in these terminals.

Eagle Point 
In addition to crude oil services, the Eagle Point terminal can accommodate three marine vessels (ships or barges) to receive and deliver refined products to outbound ships and barges. The tank farm has a total active refined products storage capacity of approximately 6 million barrels, and provides customers with access to the facility via barge and pipeline. The terminal can deliver via barge, truck or pipeline, providing customers with access to various markets. The terminal generates revenue primarily by charging fees based on throughput, blending services and storage. 
12

Marcus Hook Industrial Complex
The Marcus Hook Industrial Complex can receive refined products via marine vessel, pipeline, truck and rail, and can deliver via marine vessel, pipeline and truck. The terminal has a total active refined products storage capacity of approximately 2 million barrels.
Marcus Hook Tank Farm
The Marcus Hook Tank Farm has a total refined products storage capacity of approximately 2 million barrels. The tank farm historically served Sunoco's Marcus Hook refinery and generated revenue from the related throughput and storage. In 2012, the main processing units at the refinery were idled in connection with Sunoco's exit from its refining business. The terminal continues to receive and deliver refined products via pipeline and now primarily provides terminalling services to support movements on our refined products pipelines.
Refined Products Acquisition and Marketing
Our refined products acquisition and marketing activities include the acquisition, marketing and selling of bulk refined products such as gasoline products and distillates. These activities utilize our refined products pipeline and terminal assets, as well as third-party assets and facilities. The operating results of our refined products acquisition and marketing activities are dependent on our ability to execute sales in excess of the aggregate cost, and therefore we structure our acquisition and marketing operations to optimize the sources and timing of purchases and minimize the transportation and storage costs. In order to manage exposure to volatility in refined products prices, our policy is to (i) only purchase products for which sales contracts have been executed or for which ready markets exist, (ii) structure sales contracts so that price fluctuations do not materially impact the margins earned, and (iii) not acquire and hold physical inventory, futures contracts or other derivative instruments for the purpose of speculating on commodity price changes. However, we do utilize a hedge program involving swaps, futures and other derivative instruments to mitigate the risk associated with unfavorable market movements in the price of refined products. These derivative contracts act as a hedging mechanism against the volatility of prices. 

13

Pipeline and Terminal Control Operations
Almost all of our pipelines are operated via satellite, microwave, and frame relay communication systems from central control rooms located in Sugar Land, Texas and Montello, Pennsylvania. The Sugar Land control center primarily monitors and controls our crude oil pipelines, and the Montello control center primarily monitors and controls our NGLs and refined products pipelines. The Nederland terminal has its own control center.
The control centers operate with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, or SCADA, systems that continuously monitor real time operational data, including throughput, flow rates, and pressures. In addition, the control centers monitor alarms and throughput balances. The control centers operate remote pumps, motors and valves associated with the delivery of throughput products. The computer systems are designed to enhance leak-detection capabilities, sound automatic alarms if operational conditions occur outside of pre-established parameters, and provide for remote-controlled shutdown of pump stations on the pipelines. Pump stations and meter-measurement points along our pipelines are linked by satellite or telephone communication systems for remote monitoring and control, which reduces the requirement for full-time on-site personnel at most of these locations.
14

Competition
Pipeline Operations
Our pipelines face competition from a number of sources, including major oil companies and other common carrier pipelines. Generally, pipelines are the lowest-cost method for long-haul commodity movements. Therefore, the most significant competitors for large volume shipments are other pipelines. Competition among pipelines is based primarily on access to commodity supply, market demand, and transportation charges offered for commodity movements. In addition, in areas where additional infrastructure is needed to accommodate production needs, we compete with other pipeline providers to offer the necessary transportation services to meet market demand. Our management believes that high capital requirements, environmental considerations, and the difficulty in acquiring rights-of-way and related permits make it difficult for other companies to build competing pipelines in certain areas served by our pipelines. As a result, competing pipelines are likely to be built only in those cases in which strong market demand and attractive tariff rates support additional capacity in an area. 
In addition to competition from other pipelines, we face competition from trucks and rail that deliver products in a number of areas that we serve. While their costs may not be competitive for longer hauls or large volume shipments, these sources of transportation compete effectively for incremental and marginal volume in many areas where such means of transportation are prevalent. 
Terminalling Services
Terminal facilities compete based on pricing, accessibility to supply and distribution locations and flexibility of the terminal facility's service offering. Our terminal facilities service the crude oil, NGLs and refined products markets in the southwest, midwest and northeast United States. 
Throughput at our Nederland terminal includes both crude oil and NGLs. The primary competitors of the Nederland terminal are its refinery customers' docks and other terminal facilities located in the Beaumont, Texas area with similar capabilities to distribute these commodities to the end-user markets. 
Our Marcus Hook Industrial Complex has the capability to handle the processing, storage and distribution of crude oil, NGLs and refined products and has access to local, domestic and waterborne markets. An increase in competition for the facility could result from the development of a facility providing similar service offerings. 
Our refined products marketing terminals located in the northeast, midwest and southwest United States compete with other independent terminals on price, versatility, and services provided. The competition primarily comes from integrated petroleum companies, refining and marketing companies, independent terminal companies, and distribution companies with marketing and trading activities. 
The majority of the throughput at our crude oil terminal facilities in the northeast relates to refining operations at PES's Philadelphia refinery. In 2012, we entered into a 10-year agreement to provide terminalling services to PES at the Fort Mifflin terminal complex. For further information, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Agreements with Related Parties."
Acquisition and Marketing Activities
Our competitors for our acquisition and marketing of crude oil, NGLs and refined products include other petroleum products pipeline companies, major integrated oil companies and their marketing affiliates, independent gatherers, banks that have established trading platforms, and brokers and marketers of varying sizes, financial resources and experience. Some of these competitors have capital resources many times greater than ours, and control or have access to greater supplies of the specific commodities that we market. Competitive factors that impact our acquisition and marketing activities include price and contract flexibility, regional pricing differentials, availability of commodity supply and demand, quantity and quality of services offered, and accessibility to end markets. Our acquisition and marketing of NGLs includes butane blending services. Our patents provide us with the exclusive use and control over the technology utilized to provide these services to our customers.
15

Safety Regulation
A majority of our pipelines are subject to United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") regulations and to regulations under comparable state statutes relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities.
DOT regulations require operators of hazardous liquid interstate pipelines to develop and follow a program to assess the integrity of all pipeline segments that could affect designated "high consequence areas," including: high population areas, drinking water and ecological resource areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a pipeline release, and commercially navigable waterways. We have prepared our own written Integrity Management Program, identified the line segments that could impact high consequence areas, and completed a full assessment of these segments as prescribed by the regulations.
We are confident that our pipeline operations are in substantial compliance with applicable DOT regulations and comparable state requirements. However, an increase in expenditures may be needed in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards. Such expenditures cannot be estimated accurately at this time, but we do not believe they would likely have a material adverse effect relative to our results of operations, financial position or expected cash flows.
Environmental Regulation
General
Our operations are often subject to complex federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment, including laws and regulations which govern the handling and release of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials, some of which are discussed below. Violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and, in some instances, injunctions banning or delaying certain activities. Our management believes we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change at the federal, state and local levels, and the legislative and regulatory trend has been to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.
There are also risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations, such as releases of crude oil or hazardous substances from our pipelines or storage facilities. To the extent an event is not covered by our insurance policies, such accidental releases could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from emergency response, environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental laws or regulations.
Sunoco indemnifies us for 100 percent of all losses from environmental liabilities related to the assets contributed to SXL arising prior to, and asserted within 21 years of, February 8, 2002, the date of our initial public offering ("IPO"). Sunoco's share of liability for claims asserted thereafter will decrease by 10 percent each year through the thirtieth year following the IPO date. For example, for a claim asserted during the twenty-third year after the closing of the IPO, Sunoco would be required to indemnify the Partnership for 80 percent of its loss. There is no monetary cap on this indemnification from Sunoco. In addition, this indemnification applies to the following, purchased from Sunoco subsequent to the IPO: interests in the Mesa Pipeline System, Mid-Valley, West Texas Gulf, Inland, Marcus Hook Industrial Complex, as well as the Eagle Point Tank Farm and various other assets. Any remediation liabilities not covered by this indemnity will be our responsibility.
We have agreed to indemnify Sunoco and its affiliates for events and conditions associated with the operation of the contributed assets occurring after the IPO date and for environmental and toxic tort liabilities related to these assets to the extent Sunoco is not required to indemnify us. Total future costs for environmental remediation activities will depend upon, among other things, the extent of impact at each site; the timing and nature of required remedial actions; the technology available; and the determination of our liability at multi-party sites. As of December 31, 2016, all material environmental liabilities incurred by, and known to, us are either covered by the environmental indemnification or reserved for by us in our consolidated financial statements.
16

Air Emissions
Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state and local statutes. We will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining permits and approvals addressing air emission related issues. In addition, the federal government has enacted regulations relating to restrictions on emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHG"). At this time, our operations do not fall under any of the current GHG regulations. While the effect of these current regulations will not impact our operations, the federal, regional or state laws or regulations limiting emissions of GHGs in the United States could adversely affect the demand for crude oil, NGLs or refined products transportation and storage services, as well as contribute to increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions.
Our customers are also subject to, and similarly affected by, environmental regulations. These include federal and state actions to develop programs for the reduction of GHG emissions as well as proposals that would create a cap and trade system that would require companies to purchase carbon emission allowances for emissions at manufacturing facilities and emissions caused by the use of the fuels sold. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") indicated that it intends to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. As a result of these regulations, our customers could be required to make significant capital expenditures, operate refineries at reduced levels, and pay significant penalties. It is uncertain what our customers' responses to these emerging issues will be. Those responses could reduce throughput in our pipelines and terminals, and impact our cash flows and ability to make distributions or satisfy debt obligations.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
In the course of ordinary operations, we may generate waste that falls within the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Acts' ("CERCLA"), also known as Superfund, definition of a "hazardous substance" and, as a result, we may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. Costs for any such remedial actions, as well as any related claims, could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses to the extent not all are covered by the indemnity from Sunoco. For more information, please see "Environmental Remediation."
We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and comparable state statutes. We are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the RCRA requirements because our operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes. However, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operating activities, will in the future be designated as "hazardous wastes." Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than non-hazardous wastes. Any changes in the regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses.
We currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and comparable state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.
We have not been identified by any state or federal agency as a potentially responsible party in connection with the transport and/or disposal of any waste products to third-party disposal sites.
Water
Our operations can result in the discharge of regulated substances, including crude oil, NGLs or refined products. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, also known as the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of regulated substances into state waters or waters of the United States. Where applicable, our facilities have the required discharge permits.
The Oil Pollution Act subjects owners of covered facilities to strict joint and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of a release of oil, where the release is into navigable waters, along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the Clean Water Act and some state laws require that containment dikes and similar structures be installed to help prevent the impact on navigable waters in the event of a release. The Department of Transportation Pipeline Hazardous Materials Administration, the EPA, or various state regulatory agencies have approved our oil spill emergency response plans, and our management believes we are in substantial compliance with these laws.
17

In addition, some states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Our management believes that compliance with existing permits and compliance with foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or expected cash flows.
Environmental Remediation
Contamination resulting from releases of crude oil, NGLs and refined products is not unusual within the petroleum pipeline industry. Historic releases along our pipelines, gathering systems, and terminals as a result of past operations have resulted in impacts to the environment, including soil and groundwater. Site conditions, including soil and groundwater, are being evaluated at a number of properties where operations may have resulted in releases of hydrocarbons and other wastes. Sunoco has agreed to indemnify us from environmental and toxic tort liabilities related to the assets contributed to the extent such liabilities existed or arose from operation of these assets prior to the closing of the February 2002 IPO and are asserted within 30 years after the closing of the IPO. This indemnity will cover the costs associated with performance of the assessment, monitoring, and remediation programs, as well as any related claims and penalties. See "Environmental Regulation-General."
We have experienced releases for which we are not covered by an indemnity from Sunoco, and for which we are responsible for necessary assessment, remediation, and/or monitoring activities. We have also purchased certain pipeline and terminal assets for which we assume remediation responsibilities. Our management estimates that the total aggregate cost of performing the currently anticipated assessment, monitoring, and remediation activities at these sites is not material in relation to our operations, financial position or cash flows at December 31, 2016. We have implemented an extensive inspection program to prevent releases of crude oil, NGLs or refined products into the environment from our pipelines, gathering systems, and terminals. Any damages and liabilities incurred due to future environmental releases from our assets have the potential to substantially affect our business and our ability to generate the cash flows necessary to make distributions or satisfy debt obligations.
Rate Regulation
General Interstate Regulation
Interstate common carrier pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and related rules and orders. The Interstate Commerce Act requires that tariff rates for petroleum pipelines be "just and reasonable" and not unduly discriminatory. This statute also permits interested persons to challenge proposed new or changed rates and authorizes the FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for up to seven months and to investigate such rates. If, upon completion of an investigation, the FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the carrier to refund revenues in excess of the prior tariff during the term of the investigation. The FERC also may investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively. Upon an appropriate showing, a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint.
The FERC generally has not investigated interstate rates on its own initiative when those rates, like those we charge, have not been the subject of a protest or a complaint by a shipper. However, the FERC could investigate our rates at the urging of a third party if the third party is either a current shipper or has a substantial economic interest in the tariff rate level. Although no assurance can be given that the tariffs charged by us ultimately will be upheld if challenged, management believes that the tariffs now in effect for our pipelines are in compliance with the rates allowed under current FERC guidelines.
We have been approved by the FERC to charge market-based rates in most of the refined products locations served by our pipeline systems. In those locations where market-based rates have been approved, we are able to establish rates that are based upon competitive market conditions.
Intrastate Regulation
Some of our pipeline operations are subject to regulation by the Railroad Commission of Texas ("Texas RRC"), the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ("PA PUC") and other state regulatory agencies, as applicable. The operations of our joint venture interests are also subject to regulation in the states in which they operate. The applicable state statutes require that pipeline rates be nondiscriminatory and provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the pipeline property used to render services. State commissions generally have not initiated an investigation of rates or practices of petroleum pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints. Complaints to state agencies have been infrequent and are usually resolved informally. Although management cannot be certain that our intrastate rates ultimately would be upheld if challenged, we believe that, given this history, the tariffs now in effect are not likely to be challenged or, if challenged, are not likely to be ordered to be reduced.
18

Title to Properties
Substantially all of our pipelines were constructed on rights-of-way granted by the apparent record owners of the property and, in limited instances, these rights-of-way are revocable at the election of the grantor. Several rights-of-way for the pipelines and other real property assets are shared with other pipelines and other assets owned by affiliates of Sunoco and by third parties. In many instances, lands over which rights-of-way have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the right-of-way grants. We have obtained permits from public authorities to cross over or under, or to lay facilities in or along, watercourses, county roads, municipal streets, and state highways and, in some instances, these permits are revocable at the election of the grantor. We have also obtained permits from railroad companies to cross over or under lands or rights-of-way, many of which are also revocable at the grantor's election. In some cases, property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee. In some states and under some circumstances, we have the right of eminent domain to acquire rights-of-way and lands necessary for the common carrier pipelines. The previous owners of the applicable pipelines may not have commenced or concluded eminent domain proceedings for some rights-of-way.
Some of the leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, and licenses acquired by us or transferred to us upon the closing of the IPO require the consent of the grantor to transfer these rights, which in some instances is a governmental entity. We have obtained or are in the process of obtaining third-party consents, permits, and authorizations sufficient for the transfer of the assets necessary to operate the business in all material respects. In our opinion, with respect to any consents, permits, or authorizations that have not been obtained, the failure to obtain them will not have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business.
We have satisfactory title to substantially all of the assets contributed in connection with the IPO. Although titles to these properties are subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with acquisition of real property, liens for environmental contamination, taxes and other burdens, easements, or other restrictions, management believes that none of these burdens materially detract from the value of the properties or will materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business.
Employees
We have no employees. To carry out the operations of Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P., our general partner and its affiliates employed approximately 2,575 people at December 31, 2016 who provide direct support to the operations. Labor unions or associations represented approximately 1,220 of these employees at December 31, 2016.
(d) Financial Information about Geographical Areas
We do not have significant amounts of revenue or segment profit or loss attributable to international activities.
(e) Available Information
We make available, free of charge on our website, www.sunocologistics.com, periodic reports that we file with the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
