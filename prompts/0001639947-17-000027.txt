ITEM 1.    Business
BUSINESS
Overview
We are a self-administered, self-managed REIT with a diversified portfolio of skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”) and other healthcare assets operated by private regional and local care providers. We primarily generate our revenues by leasing our properties to unaffiliated tenants under long-term triple-net leases, pursuant to which the tenants are obligated to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. In addition, we originate and manage a small portfolio of secured and unsecured loans, made primarily to our SNF operators and other post-acute care providers.
Our company was originally formed in April 2015 to hold the post-acute/SNF portfolio of Ventas, Inc. (“Ventas”) and its subsidiaries operated by regional and local care providers (the “CCP Business”). On August 17, 2015, Ventas completed its spin-off of the CCP Business by distributing one share of our common stock for every four shares of Ventas common stock held as of the applicable record date, and, as a result, we began operating as an independent public company and our common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CCP” as of August 18, 2015.
As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio consisted of 345 properties operated by 38 private regional and local care providers, spread across 36 states and containing a total of approximately 38,000 beds/units. We conduct all of our operations through our wholly owned operating partnership, Care Capital Properties, LP (“Care Capital LP”), and its subsidiaries.
We elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, beginning with our tax year ended December 31, 2015, and since the distribution have been operating in a manner that we believe allows us to qualify as a REIT. Subject to the REIT asset test requirements, we are permitted to own up to 100% of the stock of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). We have elected for one of our subsidiaries to be treated as a TRS, which is subject to corporate income taxes on its earnings.
Our Strategy
We aim to create long-term stockholder value through the payment of consistent cash dividends and the growth of our asset base and cash flow. To achieve this goal, our strategy consists of:
 Partnering with Top Operators to Support Their Capital Needs
We are focused on leveraging our capital resources and expertise to develop strong relationships with top operators who have a demonstrated desire and ability to grow. We will seek opportunities to expand our portfolio through sale-leaseback transactions with operators, both existing and new, that have a proven track record of performance and are positioned for the future, as well as to provide various means of support for those operators in the achievement of their strategic plans.
 Strategically Disposing of Assets to Optimize Our Portfolio for Long-Term Growth
We intend to continue to dispose of non-strategic assets that do not meet our investment criteria and redeploy the proceeds into new investments, including acquisitions and redevelopment, renovation and expansion opportunities that align with our strategies. 
 Increasing Competitiveness of Existing Assets through Incremental Investments
We expect to continue to work closely with certain operators to identify and capitalize on opportunities to enhance the operations of our facilities through capital investment. When the opportunities are attractive, we may finance the redevelopment or expansion of our properties, generating higher lease rates while improving the quality of our assets and enhancing the profitability of our operators. We may also invest in ground-up development.
 Opportunistically Expanding Our Business and Diversifying into Complementary Sectors
We intend to capitalize on our size, relationships and investment expertise by actively participating as a consolidator in the highly fragmented skilled nursing industry. We will seek to identify and consummate value-enhancing acquisitions that expand and further diversify our portfolio. Over time, we may also supplement our core strategy of acquiring and investing in 
1

SNFs by opportunistically acquiring complementary healthcare properties and pursing investments other than triple-net leases, including joint ventures or other structures, as well as senior, mezzanine, secured and unsecured debt investments that are consistent with our investment objectives.
 Maintaining a Strong Balance Sheet with Access to Multiple Sources of Capital
We expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and conservative capital structure, providing the flexibility to deploy our resources effectively. We intend to actively manage our leverage and interest rate risk by utilizing primarily long-term fixed rate financing, entering into hedging arrangements, if appropriate, lengthening and staggering our debt maturities and maintaining our access to multiple sources of liquidity.
2016 Highlights and Other Recent Developments
Operating and Investing Activities

• | In December 2016, we completed the acquisition of three SNFs, two seniors housing communities and one campus (consisting of one SNF and one seniors housing community), for $36 million in a sale-leaseback transaction with an existing operator. The properties are currently being held in an Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Section 1031 exchange escrow account with a qualified intermediary. We expect to complete the acquisition of one additional SNF with the same operator for $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.


• | During 2016, we sold 17 SNFs and one specialty hospital for aggregate consideration of $123.9 million. In connection with the sale of one SNF, we made an 18-month secured loan to the purchaser in the amount of $4.5 million. In connection with the sale of seven SNFs, we made a four-year mezzanine loan to an affiliate of the purchasers in the amount of $25.0 million. 


• | During 2016, we transitioned a total of 18 SNFs from the existing tenants to replacement operators in consensual transactions. In connection with one transition, we made or purchased certain working capital loans, of which $8.1 million principal amount remained outstanding at December 31, 2016. 


• | During 2016, we also entered into definitive agreements to sell 23 properties in separate transactions for aggregate proceeds of $175 million. The sales of the properties are expected to occur in the first half of 2017.

Financing Activities

• | In July 2016, Care Capital LP issued and sold $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes due 2026”) to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A and to certain persons outside of the United States, pursuant to Regulations S, each under the Securities Act, for total proceeds of $500 million before the initial purchasers’ discount and expenses. In February 2017, we completed an offer to exchange the Notes due 2026 for a new series of substantially identical notes that are registered under the Securities Act.


• | Also in July 2016, certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Care Capital LP entered into a Loan Agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a $135 million term loan (the “$135 million Term Loan”) that bears interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1.80% and matures in July 2019. The $135 million Term Loan is secured by first lien mortgages and assignments of leases and rents on specified facilities owned by the borrowers. 


• | In May 2016, Care Capital LP issued and sold $100 million aggregate principal amount of 5.38% Senior Notes due May 17, 2027 (the “Notes due 2027”) through a private placement in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, for total proceeds of $100 million before expenses.


• | In February 2016, we issued 56,377 shares of our common stock, valued at $1.4 million, to the sellers as additional consideration for the August 2015 acquisition of our specialty healthcare and seniors housing valuation firm pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement.


• | In January 2016, we entered into a Term Loan and Guaranty Agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks that provides for a $200 million unsecured term loan due 2023 (the “$200 million Term Loan”). Also in January 2016, we entered into agreements to swap a total of $600 million of outstanding indebtedness, effectively converting the interest on that debt from floating rates to fixed rates. The swap agreements have original terms of 4.6 years and seven years.

Our Portfolio
Our portfolio consists of SNFs, specialty hospitals and healthcare assets, seniors housing communities and campuses and other investments. See Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
SNFs
Our SNFs provide rehabilitative, restorative, skilled nursing and medical treatment for patients and residents who do not require the high technology, care-intensive, high-cost setting of an acute care or rehabilitation hospital. Patients and residents generally come to SNFs to receive post-acute care to recover from an illness or surgery or long-term care with skilled nursing assistance to aid with numerous daily living activities. Treatment programs include physical, occupational, speech, respiratory and other therapies, including sub-acute clinical protocols such as wound care and intravenous drug treatment. SNF operators receive payment for these services through a combination of government reimbursement, including Medicare and Medicaid, and private sources.
Specialty Hospitals and Healthcare Assets
Our specialty hospitals and healthcare assets include hospitals focused on providing children’s care, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-term acute care hospitals and personal care facilities. Our inpatient rehabilitation facilities are devoted to the rehabilitation of patients with various neurological, musculoskeletal, orthopedic and other medical conditions following stabilization of their acute medical issues. Our long-term acute care hospitals serve medically-complex, chronically-ill patients who require high levels of monitoring and specialized care, but whose conditions do not necessitate the continued services of an intensive care unit. These hospitals are freestanding facilities, and we do not own any “hospitals within hospitals.” Our personal care facilities provide specialized care, including supported living services, neurorehabilitation, neurobehavioral management and vocational programs, for persons with acquired or traumatic brain injury.
Seniors Housing Communities and Campuses
Our seniors housing communities and campuses, which we lease pursuant to pooled, multi-facility master lease agreements with certain of our SNFs, include independent and assisted living communities, continuing care retirement communities and communities providing care for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia or memory loss. These communities offer studio, one bedroom and two bedroom residential units on a month-to-month basis primarily to elderly individuals requiring various levels of assistance. Basic services for residents of these communities include housekeeping, meals in a central dining area and group activities organized by the staff with input from the residents. More extensive care and personal supervision, at additional fees, are also available for such needs as eating, bathing, grooming, transportation, limited therapeutic programs and medication administration, which allow residents certain conveniences and enable them to live as independently as possible according to their abilities. These services are often met by home health providers, close coordination with the resident’s physician and SNFs. Charges for room, board and services are generally paid from private sources.
Net Investment in Direct Financing Lease
As of December 31, 2016, we owned one SNF that we lease to an operator under a direct financing lease, as the tenant is obligated to purchase the property at the end of the lease term. Our net investment in the direct financing lease represents the total undiscounted rental payments (including the tenant's purchase obligation), plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value, less the unearned lease income. Unearned lease income represents the excess of the minimum lease payments and residual values over the cost of the investment.
Loans Receivable, Net
As of December 31, 2016, we had $62.3 million of net loans receivable relating to SNFs and other healthcare properties or operators. Our loans receivable provide us with interest income, principal amortization and transaction fees and generally are secured by mortgage liens on the underlying properties or other collateral and supported by corporate or personal guarantees by affiliates of the borrowing entity. In some cases, the loans are secured by a pledge of ownership interests in the entities that own the related properties. See “Note 6—Loans Receivable, Net” of the Notes to Combined Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Certificates of Need
Our SNFs, specialty hospitals and healthcare assets are generally subject to federal, state and local licensure statutes and statutes that may impose building moratoriums or require regulatory approval, in the form of a certificate of need (“CON”), or variations thereof, issued by a governmental agency with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities or otherwise, prior to the expansion of existing facilities, construction of new facilities, addition of beds, acquisition of major equipment or introduction of new services. CON and similar requirements, which are not uniform throughout the United States, may provide some protection against competition, but also may restrict our or our operators’ ability to expand our properties in certain circumstances.
The following table summarizes the amount of our rental income derived by properties located in states with and without CON requirements (including variations thereof and building moratoriums) for the year ended December 31, 2016:

 | Percent of Rental Income
 | SNFs | | Specialty Hospitals and Healthcare Assets | | Total
States with CON (or similar) requirements | 71.4 | % | | 56.6 | % | 70.1 | %
States without CON (or similar) requirements | 28.6 | | | 43.4 | | 29.9 | 
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

Significant Tenants
The following table summarizes our tenant concentration (excluding properties classified as held for sale) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016:
 | Number ofPropertiesLeased from CCP | Percent of Total Real Estate Investments (1) | | Percent of Total Revenues (2)
Senior Care Centers, LLC | 37 | | 20.5 | % | 16.4 | %
Signature HealthCARE, LLC | 49 | | 8.9 | | 13.7 | 
Avamere Group, LLC | 29 | | 10.9 | | 10.9 | 


(1) | Based on gross book value of tangible real estate property.


(2) | Total revenues includes income from investments in direct financing lease and loans, real estate services fee income and interest and other income and excludes net gain on lease termination.

Each of our leases with SCC, Signature HealthCARE, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Signature”) and Avamere Group, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Avamere”) is a triple-net lease that obligates the tenant to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures.
Because our three largest operators account for a meaningful portion of our total revenues, the failure or inability of SCC, Signature or Avamere to satisfy its obligations to us or to renew its leases with us upon expiration of the terms thereof could adversely affect the condition of the leased properties and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. SCC, Signature and Avamere, and/or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, may not have sufficient assets, equity, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective lease and other obligations to us, and we cannot predict whether SCC, Signature or Avamere will elect to renew its leases with us upon expiration of their terms or that we will be able to reposition any non-renewed properties on a timely basis or on the same or better economic and other terms, if at all.
Competition
We generally compete for investments in SNFs and other healthcare assets with publicly traded, private and non-listed healthcare REITs, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of which have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition challenges our ability to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives, which is affected by, among other factors, the availability of 
4

suitable acquisition or investment targets, our ability to negotiate acceptable transaction terms and our access to and cost of capital.
Our tenants also compete on a local and regional basis with other healthcare operating companies that provide comparable services. These operators compete to attract and retain residents and patients based on their hospital and managed care relationships, scope and quality of care, reputation and financial condition, price, location and physical appearance of the properties, services offered, qualified personnel, physician referrals and family preferences. The ability of our tenants to compete successfully could be affected by private, federal and state reimbursement programs and other laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 69 employees, including 34 employees associated with our specialty healthcare and seniors housing valuation firm. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
Insurance
We maintain or require in our leases and other agreements that our tenants maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. We believe that the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and the policies required to be maintained by our tenants are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. Although we regularly monitor our tenants’ compliance with their respective insurance requirements, we cannot provide any assurances that they will maintain the required insurance coverages, and their failure, inability or unwillingness to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We also cannot provide any assurances that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our leases and other agreements, that such insurance coverage will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses related to our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we provide any assurances as to the future financial viability of the insurers.
Additionally, we maintain a comprehensive corporate insurance program, including general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability and workers’ compensation policies, among others, to protect us, our directors, officers and certain employees against various liabilities in the ordinary course of our business. We obtain such policies in amounts and with the coverage and deductibles that we believe are adequate based on the nature and risks of our business, historical experience and industry standards.
For various reasons, including to reduce and manage costs, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with self-insurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less coverage than a traditional insurance policy. As a result, companies that self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. The implementation of a trust or captive by any of our tenants could adversely affect its ability to comply with and satisfy its obligations under its leases and other agreements with us.
Our Industry 
As of December 31, 2016, approximately 87% of our revenues (excluding net gain on lease termination) were derived from investments in SNFs. We believe the SNF industry will benefit from near-term demographic, economic and regulatory trends driving demand for post-acute and long-term care services provided by SNFs. Specifically, an aging population, longer life expectancies, higher patient acuity and healthcare policy measures that shift treatment to the lowest cost, most clinically appropriate settings are expected to generate increased utilization of SNFs over time. These factors, coupled with the modest decline in the number of SNFs over the past several years, should support increasing demand for our properties.
At the same time, SNF operators are facing various operational, legal and regulatory challenges due to, among other things, increased wages and labor costs, staffing shortages and higher expenses associated with increased government investigations, enforcement proceedings and legal actions related to professional and general liability claims. With a dependence on government reimbursement as the primary source of their revenues, SNF operators are also subject to intensified efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls, through value-based payments, managed care and similar programs, resulting in lower daily reimbursement rates, decreased occupancies due to shorter lengths of stay and declining operating margins. 
5

We believe that these trends will be advantageous for quality operators who can effectively adapt their operating model to accommodate the changing reimbursement and regulatory environments and will result in increased demand for post-acute properties.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Overview
Our revenues are derived primarily from the leasing of properties in which our tenants receive reimbursement for their services under governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We are neither a participant in, nor a direct recipient of, any reimbursement under these programs with respect to those facilities.
Governmental and other concerns regarding health care costs have resulted, and may continue to result, in significant downward pressure on patient lengths of stay and payments to healthcare facilities, and we cannot predict whether future payment rates for either governmental or private healthcare plans will be sufficient to cover cost increases in providing services to patients. We expect that efforts by the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs and non-governmental third-party payors (including health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), managed care companies and other private insurance carriers), to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon operators (through changes in reimbursement rates and methodologies, including the switch from fee-for-service to value-based payments, discounted fee structures, and accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), in which healthcare providers assume all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise) will intensify. We also expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased scrutiny in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, among others. A significant expansion of applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations, existing or future healthcare reform measures, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, changes in enforcement priorities, or significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed or reductions in reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our operators’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations, including making rental payments under and otherwise complying with the terms of our leases.
Licensure, Certification and CONs
In order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the operators of our SNFs generally must be licensed on an annual or biannual basis and certified annually through various regulatory agencies that determine compliance with federal, state and local laws. Legal requirements pertaining to such licensure and certification relate to the quality of nursing care provided by the operator, qualifications of the operator’s administrative personnel and nursing staff, adequacy of the physical plant and equipment and continuing compliance with laws and regulations governing the operation of SNFs. Similarly, the operators of our specialty hospitals must meet the applicable conditions of participation established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and comply with state and local laws and regulations in order to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. We generally either own or have security interests in the licenses required to operate our properties. The failure to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval or to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could prevent an operator from continuing operations at a property, and a loss of licensure or certification 
6

could adversely affect an operator’s ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which, in turn, could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under and otherwise complying with the terms of our leases. Such loss could also adversely affect the value of our properties, making them harder to transfer and/or increasing the need for additional capital.
Many of our SNFs and specialty hospitals are also subject to state CON laws that require governmental approval prior to the development or expansion of healthcare facilities and services. The approval process in these states generally requires a demonstration of the need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. In addition, CONs, where applicable, may be required for changes in ownership or control of licensed facilities, addition of beds, investment in major capital equipment, introduction of new services or termination of services previously approved through the CON process. While CON laws and regulations may provide some protection against competition, they could also restrict an operator’s ability to expand our properties and grow its business in certain circumstances.
Seniors housing communities, in contrast, are subject to relatively few, if any, federal regulations. Such regulation consists primarily of state and local laws governing licensure, provision of services, staffing requirements and other operational matters, which vary greatly from one jurisdiction to another.
Reimbursement
Our tenants receive their revenues primarily from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and non-governmental third-party payors, such as HMOs, managed care companies and other private insurance carriers. As federal and state governments face budget pressures, healthcare reform initiatives and efforts to reduce costs by these payors are likely to continue beyond those set forth in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (together with its reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the “Affordable Care Act”) and the Budget Control Act of 2011, despite the potential repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act. Efforts to implement new and evolving payor and provider programs in the United States, including Medicare Advantage, dual eligible demonstrations, ACOs and bundled payment programs, could result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by our operators. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent the Affordable Care Act will be repealed or replaced, or that existing or future healthcare reform legislation or changes in the administration or implementation of healthcare reimbursement programs will not materially adversely affect our operators’ liquidity, financial condition or results of operations or their ability to satisfy their obligations to us.
In August 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) announced a modification to its Five Star Quality Rating System, which rates all SNFs that participate in Medicare or Medicaid on the basis of staffing, quality measures and the results of state health inspections. The modification, which was phased in through January 2017, consisted of new quality measures based primarily on Medicare claims data submitted by hospitals, including: (i) percentage of short-stay residents who were successfully discharged to the community; (ii) percentage of short-stay residents who have had an outpatient emergency department visit; (iii) percentage of short-stay residents who were re-hospitalized after a nursing home admission; (iv) percentage of short-stay residents who made improvements in function; and (v) percentage of long-stay residents whose ability to move independently worsened. It is possible that this or any other ranking system could lead to future reimbursement policies that reward or penalize facilities on the basis of the reported quality of care parameters.
On September 28, 2016, CMS issued its final rule significantly revising the requirements that long-term care facilities, including SNFs and long-term acute care hospitals, must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The provisions of the rule, which finalizes CMS’s original proposal issued in July 2015 and is the first comprehensive update to long-term care facility standards since 1991, are targeted at reducing unnecessary hospital readmissions and infections, improving the quality of care and strengthening safety measures for residents in these facilities. Changes in the final rule, to be implemented in three phases, include:

• | a prohibition on the use of pre-dispute binding arbitration agreements with residents;


• | the requirement that long-term care facility staff members be properly trained to care for residents with dementia and to prevent elder abuse;


• | improved care planning, including consideration of the residents’ wishes, provision of necessary information for follow-up after discharge and transmission of discharge plans to receiving facilities;


• | allowing dietitians and therapy providers to write orders in their areas of expertise when physicians delegate that responsibility to them and state licensing laws allow it; and

7


• | updates to long-term care facilities’ infection prevention and control programs, including requiring infection prevention and control officers and antibiotic stewardship programs.

On November 7, 2016, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi granted the American Health Care Association a preliminary injunction barring CMS from implementing the prohibition on the use of pre-dispute binding arbitration agreements under the final rule while the parties litigate the case. It is unclear whether CMS will appeal the injunction under the new administration. We are currently analyzing the implications of this final rule.
On December 20, 2016, CMS finalized new bundled payment models for cardiac care and expanded the existing bundled payment model for hip replacements to other hip surgeries that continue its progress to shift Medicare payments from rewarding quantity to quality by creating strong incentives for hospitals to deliver better care to patients at a lower cost. For the new cardiac bundles, participants are hospitals in 98 metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) that were randomly selected, and for the expanded hip bundles, participation is limited to the same 67 MSAs that were selected for the existing Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model. Implementation of the new and expanded models will be phased in over a five-year period, beginning July 1, 2017. We are currently analyzing the potential impact of this rule on our SNF operators.
SNF Medicare Reimbursement
For nearly 30 years, SNF operators have received payment from Medicare for their services under a fee-for-service reimbursement model, or prospective payment system known as “SNF PPS.” Under SNF PPS, payment amounts are made on a per diem basis for each resident, based upon classifications determined through assessments of the individual Medicare patients in the SNF, rather than on the facility’s reasonable costs. Such payments are generally intended to cover all inpatient services for Medicare patients, including routine nursing care, most capital-related costs associated with the inpatient stay and ancillary services, such as respiratory therapy, occupational and physical therapy, speech therapy and certain covered drugs, without regard to quality of care or patient outcome. Updates to SNF PPS payment rates are established by CMS and published annually for the federal fiscal year (October 1 through September 30). In April 2015, however, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) permanently repealed the Sustainable Growth Rate payment formula for Medicare reimbursement rates on physician services and required that Medicare payment rates for post-acute care providers increase by no more than 1% for fiscal year 2018, after application of the productivity adjustment mandated by the Affordable Care Act. The full impact of MACRA on our operators is not yet known. 
On August 5, 2016, CMS published its final rule updating SNF PPS for the 2017 fiscal year (October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017). Under the final rule, the SNF PPS standard federal payment rate would increase by 2.4% in fiscal year 2017, reflecting a 2.7% increase in the market basket index, less a 0.3% productivity adjustment. CMS estimates that net payments to SNFs as a result of the final rule will increase by approximately $920 million in fiscal year 2017. In addition, CMS adopted various measures pertaining to the SNF Quality Reporting Program, as well as the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program, and other standards aimed at implementing value-based purchasing for SNFs. We regularly assess the financial implications of CMS’s rules and other federal legislation on our SNF operators.
Over the last several years, many public and private payors and healthcare providers have experimented with alternative payment models to address widespread concerns about increasing costs and care inefficiencies created by traditional fee-for-service reimbursement methodologies. Some of the more prevalent alternative payment models include ACOs (in which a network of providers share responsibility for coordinating care within a defined expenditure limit), bundled payment arrangements (under which payors compensate providers with a single payment for an episode of care), pay for performance (through which providers are reimbursed based on the achievement of pre-determined quality measures), and patient centered medical homes (in which care is coordinated through a patient’s primary care physician). As CMS is targeting 50% of all Medicare reimbursements to be made through alternative payment models by the end of 2018, these models evidence a gradual shift in the nation’s healthcare delivery and payment systems from volume-based to value-based care.
SNF Medicaid Reimbursement
A significant portion of all SNF residents are dependent on Medicaid. Medicaid reimbursement rates, however, typically are less than private pay rates. Although the federal government and states share responsibility for financing Medicaid, states have a wide range of discretion, within certain federal guidelines, to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology. In addition, federal legislation limits an operator’s ability to withdraw from the Medicaid program by restricting the eviction or transfer of Medicaid residents. When state budget pressures escalate, in an effort to address shortfalls, many state legislatures enact or propose reductions to Medicaid expenditures by implementing “freezes” or cuts in Medicaid rates paid to providers, including hospitals and SNFs, or by restricting eligibility and benefits.
8

From time to time, states may may adopt Medicaid rate freezes or cuts or other program changes as their reimbursement methodologies continue to evolve. Examples of these changes are Medicaid managed care, which delivers health benefits and additional services through contracted arrangements between state Medicaid agencies and managed care organizations that accept a set capitation payment for those services, and dual eligible demonstrations, which seek to coordinate care for individuals covered by both Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the U.S. government may revoke, reduce or stop approving “provider taxes” or intergovernmental transfer payment programs that have the effect of increasing Medicaid payments within the states. Some of the current proposals to replace the Affordable Care Act would also convert Medicaid to block grants, giving each state a fixed amount of federal money to provide healthcare to low-income individuals.
On April 25, 2016, CMS released its final rule setting forth a range of new requirements and regulations for states and Medicaid managed care plans, including implementation of medical loss ratios, actuarial soundness standards, availability of services, adequate capacity and network adequacy standards, as well as the requirement that states establish Medicaid managed care quality ratings, among other things.
State Medicaid Reimbursement: Texas
The largest number of properties in our portfolio are located in Texas and accounted for 21.1% of our total revenues (excluding net gain on lease termination) for the year ended December 31, 2016. In August 2015, CMS and the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (“THHC”) began a three-year federal/state partnership to better serve individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (“Dual Eligible”). THHC entered into agreements with several Medicaid-Medicare Plans (“MMPs”) with the following goals: minimize cost sharing; align incentives; streamline the process for providers; and improve the quality of care. The program covers Dual Eligible individuals located in six of Texas’ most populous counties, and two to three MMPs are assigned to each county. Eligible individuals are passively enrolled and assigned to an MMP, unless they opt out.
Notably, under the terms of the agreements with the MMPs, skilled nursing services may be provided without a preceding stay in an acute care hospital as long as the stay was authorized by the MMP prior to the stay and the care is clinically appropriate. Potential risks of this program, however, are disruptions in reimbursement payments, complex billing procedures, greater negotiation of service rates that currently mirror resource utilization groups (“RUGs”) levels and reduced length of stays for skilled nursing services over time.
Fraud and Abuse Enforcement
The operators of our properties who participate in, receive payments from or make or receive referrals for work in connection with government-funded healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations that prohibit certain fraudulent or abusive business practices. These laws include, among others:

• | the anti-kickback statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act), prohibiting the payment, receipt or solicitation of any remuneration to induce a referral of any patient or service or item covered by a federal or state healthcare program;


• | the physician self-referral prohibition (Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the “Stark Law”), prohibiting referrals by physicians of Medicare or Medicaid patients to healthcare providers with which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have ownership interests or certain other financial arrangements;


• | the False Claims Act, prohibiting any person from knowingly presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment by the federal government (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs);


• | the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, authorizing HHS to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent acts; and


• | the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (commonly referred to as “HIPAA”), protecting the privacy and security of personally identifiable health information by limiting its use and disclosure.

Sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties, such as punitive sanctions, damage assessments, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These laws also impose an affirmative duty on operators to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from Medicare and other governmental healthcare programs.
9

Many states in which our tenants operate have adopted similar anti-fraud and abuse laws, some of which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals, regardless of whether the service was reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have also adopted or are considering legislative proposals to increase patient protections, such as minimum staffing requirements, criminal background checks and limiting the use and disclosure of patient specific health information. Failure to comply with these laws may result in the imposition of criminal or civil penalties and other sanctions.
In the ordinary course of their business, the operators of our properties are subject to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable laws and regulations. Increased funding through legislation and the creation of a series of new healthcare crimes by HIPAA have led to significant expansion in the number and scope of investigations and enforcement actions over the past several years, and as federal and state budget pressures persist, administrative agencies may continue to escalate these efforts to eliminate waste and control fraud and abuse in governmental healthcare programs. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud has also increased, due in large part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act in 1986 that were designed to encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits, known as qui tam suits, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients or nurses and other employees. A violation of federal or state anti-fraud and abuse laws or regulations by an operator of our properties could materially adversely affect the operator’s liquidity, financial condition or results of operations and its ability to satisfy its obligations to us. Certain of our operators have responded to subpoenas and other requests for information regarding their operations in connection with inquiries by the U.S. Department of Justice or other regulatory agencies.
Environmental Regulation
As an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations address various matters, including asbestos, fuel oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, medical wastes and hazardous wastes. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. For example, although we do not operate or manage our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property’s value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources.
Under the terms of our lease agreements, we generally have a right to indemnification by the tenants of our properties for any contamination caused by them. However, we cannot provide any assurances that our tenants will have the financial capability or willingness to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness to do so may require us to satisfy the underlying environmental claims.
In some cases, we have agreed to indemnify our tenants against any environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs) resulting from any condition arising in, on or under, or relating to, the leased properties at any time before the applicable lease commencement date, unless the tenant or operator contributed to the condition.
CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to holders of our common stock. This summary is based on the Code, U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) regulations promulgated thereunder, rulings and other administrative pronouncements issued by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of which are subject to change or different interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. The laws governing the U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs and their stockholders are highly technical and complex, and this summary is qualified in its entirety by the authorities listed above. We cannot provide any assurances that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position to the contrary to any of the tax consequences described below, and we have not sought , nor do we intend to seek, a ruling from the IRS regarding any matter discussed in this summary. This summary is also based upon the assumption that we and our subsidiaries and affiliated entities will operate in accordance with our and their applicable organizational documents or partnership agreements. This summary is for general information only and is not tax advice. It does not purport to discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular investor in light of its particular investment or tax circumstances or to investors subject to special rules under the Code, including but not limited to:

• | financial institutions;

10


• | insurance companies;


• | broker-dealers;


• | “S” corporations;


• | regulated investment companies and REITs;


• | foreign sovereigns and their controlled entities;


• | partnerships and trusts;


• | partners in partnerships that hold our common stock;


• | persons who hold our shares on behalf of other persons as nominees;


• | individuals who receive our common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation;


• | stockholders who hold our common stock as part of a “hedge,” “straddle,” “conversion,” “synthetic security,” “integrated investment” or “constructive sale transaction”;


• | tax-exempt organizations;


• | pass-through entities and persons holding our common stock through a partnership or other pass-through entity;


• | traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting; and


• | stockholders who are subject to alternative minimum tax.

Finally, this summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to investors who will not hold our common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment).
The U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders of our common stock depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. In addition, the tax consequences to any particular stockholder of holding our common stock will depend on the stockholder’s particular tax circumstances. You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income and other tax consequences to you in light of your particular investment or tax circumstances of acquiring, holding, exchanging, or otherwise disposing of our common stock.
Taxation of CCP
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, in the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. We believe that we are organized, and operate, in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Code.
Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of share and asset ownership, various qualification requirements imposed upon REITs by the Code. Our ability to qualify to be taxed as a REIT also requires that we satisfy certain tests, some of which depend upon the fair market values of assets that we own directly or indirectly. Such values may not be susceptible to a precise determination. Accordingly, although we intend to continue to operate in such a manner to qualify as a REIT, we cannot provide any assurances that the actual results of our operations for any taxable year will satisfy such requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
Taxation of REITs in General
As indicated above, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various qualification requirements imposed upon REITs by the Code. The material qualification requirements are summarized below under “—Requirements for Qualification—General. ” While we have operated, and intend to operate in the future, so 
11

that we qualify and continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we cannot provide any assurances that the IRS will not challenge our qualification, or that we will be able to operate in accordance with the REIT requirements in the future. Please refer to “—Failure to Qualify.”
Provided that we qualify to be taxed as a REIT, generally we will be entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our net REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from an investment in a C corporation. A “C corporation” is a corporation that generally is required to pay tax at the corporate level. “Double taxation” means taxation once at the corporate level when income is earned and once again at the stockholder level when the income is distributed. In general, the income that we generate is taxed only at the stockholder level upon a distribution of dividends to our stockholders.
Under current law, most U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates are taxed on corporate dividends at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 23.8% (the same as the current rate for long-term capital gains), including the 3.8% Medicare tax described below. With limited exceptions, however, dividends from us or from other entities that are taxed as REITs are generally not eligible for this rate and will continue to be taxed at rates applicable to ordinary income. Presently, the highest marginal non-corporate U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income is 39.6%. Please refer to “—Taxation of Stockholders—Distributions.”
Any net operating losses, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes generally do not pass through to our stockholders, subject to special rules for certain items such as the capital gains that we recognize. Please refer to “—Taxation of Stockholders—Distributions.”
If we qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we will nonetheless be subject to U.S. federal tax in the following circumstances:

• | We will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed net taxable income, including undistributed net capital gains;


• | We may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference, including any deductions of net operating losses;


• | If we have net income from prohibited transactions, which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property, such income will be subject to a 100% tax. Please refer to “—Prohibited Transactions” and “—Foreclosure Property” below;


• | If we elect to treat property that we acquire in connection with a foreclosure of a mortgage loan or certain leasehold terminations as “foreclosure property,” we may thereby avoid the 100% tax on gain from a resale of that property (if the sale would otherwise constitute a prohibited transaction), but the income from the sale or operation of the property may be subject to corporate income tax at the highest applicable rate (currently 35%);


• | If we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test and/or the 95% gross income test, as discussed below, but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT because we satisfy certain other requirements, we may be subject to a penalty tax. In that case, the amount of the penalty tax will be (1) the greater of (A) the amount by which we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test and (B) the amount by which we fail to satisfy the 95% gross income test, multiplied by (2) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability;


• | If we violate the asset tests (other than certain de minimis violations) or other requirements applicable to REITs, as described below, and yet maintain our qualification as a REIT because there is reasonable cause for the failure and other applicable requirements are met, we may be subject to a penalty tax. In that case, the amount of the penalty tax will be at least $50,000 per failure, and, in the case of certain asset test failures, will be determined as the amount of net income generated by the non-qualifying assets in question multiplied by the highest corporate tax rate (currently 35%) if that amount exceeds $50,000 per failure;


• | If we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year and (iii) any undistributed net taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a non-deductible 4% excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of (a) the amounts that we actually distributed and (b) the amounts we retained and upon which we paid income tax at the corporate level;

12


• | We may be required to pay monetary penalties to the IRS in certain circumstances, including if we fail to meet record-keeping requirements intended to monitor our compliance with rules relating to the composition of a REIT’s stockholders, as described below in “—Requirements for Qualification—General;”


• | A 100% tax may be imposed on transactions between us and a TRS that do not reflect arm’s-length terms;


• | If we acquire appreciated assets from a corporation that is not a REIT (i.e., a corporation taxable under subchapter C of the Code) in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of the subchapter C corporation, we may be subject to tax on such appreciation at the highest corporate income tax rate then applicable if we subsequently recognize gain on a disposition of any such assets during the five-year period following their acquisition from the subchapter C corporation; and


• | The earnings of any subsidiaries that are subchapter C corporations, including any TRSs, will generally be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax.

In addition, we and our subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local, and foreign income, property, gross receipts and other taxes on our assets and operations. We could also be subject to tax in situations and on transactions not presently contemplated.
Requirements for Qualification—General
The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association:

(1) | that is managed by one or more trustees or directors;


(2) | the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;


(3) | that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for its election to be subject to tax as a REIT;


(4) | that is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to specific provisions of the Code;


(5) | the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons;


(6) | in which, during the last half of each taxable year, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding equity is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer “individuals” (as defined in the Code to include specified tax-exempt entities); and


(7) | that meets other tests described below, including with respect to the nature of its income and assets.

The Code provides that conditions (1) through (4) must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Conditions (5) and (6) need not be met during a corporation’s initial tax year as a REIT (which, in our case, was the taxable year ended December 31, 2015). Our certificate of incorporation includes restrictions regarding the ownership and transfers of our shares, which are intended to assist us in satisfying the share ownership requirements described in conditions (5) and (6) above. These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in conditions (5) and (6) above. If we fail to satisfy these share ownership requirements, except as provided in the next sentence, our status as a REIT will terminate. If, however, we comply with the rules contained in applicable Treasury regulations that require us to ascertain the actual ownership of our shares and we do not know, or would not have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence, that we failed to meet the requirements described in condition (6) above, we will be treated as having met this requirement.
To monitor compliance with the share ownership requirements, we generally are required to maintain records regarding the actual ownership of our shares. To do so, we must demand written statements each year from the record holders of significant percentages of our shares pursuant to which the record holders must disclose the actual owners of the shares (i.e., the persons required to include our dividends in their gross income). We must maintain a list of those persons failing or refusing to comply with this demand as part of our records. We could be subject to monetary penalties if we fail to comply with these record-keeping requirements. If a record holder fails or refuses to comply with the demands, that holder will be required by 
13

Treasury regulations to submit a statement with its tax return disclosing its actual ownership of our shares and other information.
In addition, a corporation generally may not elect to become a REIT unless its taxable year is the calendar year. We have adopted December 31 as our year-end and thereby satisfy this requirement.
Effect of Subsidiary Entities
Ownership of Partnership Interests
If we are a partner in an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Treasury regulations provide that we are deemed to own our proportionate share of the partnership’s assets, and to earn our proportionate share of the partnership’s income, without regard to whether the partners received a distribution from the partnership, for purposes of the asset and gross income tests applicable to REITs. Our proportionate share of a partnership’s assets and income is based on our capital interest in the partnership (except that for purposes of the 10% asset test, described below, our proportionate share of the partnership’s assets is based on our proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by the partnership). In addition, the assets and gross income of the partnership are deemed to retain the same character in our hands. Thus, our proportionate share of the assets and income of any of our subsidiary partnerships are treated as our assets and items of income for purposes of applying the REIT requirements. In addition, any change in the status of any partnership for tax purposes might be treated as a taxable event, in which case we could have taxable income that is subject to REIT distribution requirements without receiving any cash.
If we become a limited partner or non-managing member in any partnership or limited liability company and such entity takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our status as a REIT or require us to pay tax, we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity. In addition, it is possible that a partnership or limited liability company could take an action that could cause us to fail a gross income or asset test, and that we would not become aware of such action in time to dispose of our interest in the partnership or limited liability company or take otherwise corrective action on a timely basis. In that case, we could fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT unless we were entitled to relief, as described below.
Under the Code and the Treasury regulations, income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership must be allocated for tax purposes so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, the unrealized gain or unrealized loss associated with the property at the time of the contribution. The amount of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss is generally equal to the difference between the fair market value of the contributed property at the time of contribution, and the adjusted tax basis of such property at the time of contribution, or a book-tax difference. Such allocations are solely for federal income tax purposes and do not affect the book capital accounts or other economic or legal arrangements among the partners.
To the extent that any of our subsidiary partnerships acquires appreciated (or depreciated) properties by way of capital contributions from its partners, allocations would need to be made in a manner consistent with these requirements. Where a partner contributes cash to a partnership at a time that the partnership holds appreciated (or depreciated) property, the Treasury regulations provide for a similar allocation of these items to the other (i.e., non-contributing) partners. These rules may apply to a contribution that we make to any subsidiary partnerships of the cash proceeds received in offerings of our shares. As a result, the partners of our subsidiary partnerships, including us, could be allocated greater or lesser amounts of depreciation and taxable income in respect of a partnership’s properties than would be the case if all of the partnership’s assets (including any contributed assets) had a tax basis equal to their fair market values at the time of any contributions to that partnership. This could cause us to recognize, over a period of time, taxable income in excess of cash flow from the partnership, which might adversely affect our ability to comply with the REIT distribution requirements discussed above.
Disregarded Subsidiaries
If we own a corporate subsidiary that is a “qualified REIT subsidiary,” that subsidiary is generally disregarded as a separate entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and all of the subsidiary’s assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit are treated as our assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit, including for purposes of the gross income and asset tests applicable to REITs. A qualified REIT subsidiary is any corporation, other than a TRS (as described below), that is directly or indirectly wholly owned by a REIT. Other entities that are wholly owned by us, including single member limited liability companies that have not elected to be taxed as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, are also generally disregarded as separate entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests. Disregarded subsidiaries, along with any partnerships in which we hold an equity interest, are sometimes referred to herein as “pass-through subsidiaries.”
14

In the event that a disregarded subsidiary of ours ceases to be wholly owned—for example, if any equity interest in the subsidiary is acquired by a person other than us or another disregarded subsidiary of ours—the subsidiary’s separate existence would no longer be disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Instead, the subsidiary would have multiple owners and would be treated as either a partnership or a taxable corporation. Such an event could, depending on the circumstances, adversely affect our ability to satisfy the various asset and gross income requirements applicable to REITs, including the requirement that the REITs generally may not own, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the securities of another corporation. Please refer to “—Asset Tests” and “—Income Tests.”
Taxable REIT Subsidiaries
In general, we may jointly elect with a subsidiary corporation, whether or not wholly owned, to treat such subsidiary corporation as a TRS. We generally may not own more than 10% of the securities of a taxable corporation, as measured by voting power or value, unless we and such corporation elect to treat such corporation as a TRS. The separate existence of a TRS or other taxable corporation is not ignored for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a TRS or other taxable subsidiary corporation generally is subject to corporate income tax on its earnings, which may reduce the cash flow that we and our subsidiaries generate in the aggregate and may reduce our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
A TRS may not directly or indirectly operate or manage any healthcare facilities or lodging facilities or provide rights to any brand name under which any healthcare facility or lodging facility is operated. A TRS may provide rights to any brand name under which any healthcare facility or lodging facility is operated if such rights are provided to an “eligible independent contractor” (as described below) to operate or manage a healthcare facility or lodging facility if such rights are held by the TRS as a franchisee, licensee or in a similar capacity and such healthcare facility or lodging facility is owned by the TRS or leased to the TRS by its parent REIT. A TRS will not be treated as operating or managing a “qualified healthcare property” or a “qualified lodging facility” solely because the TRS directly or indirectly possesses a license, permit or similar instrument enabling it to do so.
We are not treated as holding the assets of a TRS or other taxable subsidiary corporation or as receiving any income that the subsidiary earns. Rather, the stock issued by a taxable subsidiary corporation to us is an asset in our hands, and we treat the dividends paid to us from such taxable subsidiary corporation, if any, as income. This treatment can affect our income and asset test calculations, as described below. Because we do not include the assets and income of TRSs or other taxable subsidiary corporations on a look-through basis in determining our compliance with the REIT requirements, we may use such entities to undertake indirectly activities that the REIT rules might otherwise preclude us from doing directly or through pass-through subsidiaries. For example, we may use TRSs or other taxable subsidiary corporations to perform services or conduct activities that give rise to certain categories of income or to conduct activities that, if conducted by us directly, would be treated in our hands as prohibited transactions.
The “earnings stripping” rules of Section 163(j) of the Code may limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to its parent REIT to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. Accordingly, if we lend money to a TRS, the TRS may be unable to deduct all or a part of the interest paid on that loan, and the lack of an interest deduction could result in a material increase in the amount of tax paid by the TRS. Further, the TRS rules impose a 100% excise tax on transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT or the REIT’s tenants that are not conducted on an arm’s-length basis. We intend that all of our transactions with our TRS, if any, will be conducted on an arm’s-length basis.
We may hold a significant amount of assets in one or more TRSs, subject to the limitation that securities in TRSs may not represent more than 25% (20% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of our assets.
Income Tests
In order to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis. First, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year, excluding gross income from sales of inventory or dealer property in “prohibited transactions,” discharge of indebtedness and certain hedging transactions, generally must be derived from “rents from real property,” gains from the sale of real estate assets, interest income derived from mortgage loans secured by real property (including certain types of mortgage-backed securities), dividends received from other REITs, and specified income from temporary investments. Second, at least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, discharge of indebtedness and certain hedging transactions, must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, and gain from the sale or disposition of equity or securities, which need not have any relation to real property. Income and gain from certain hedging transactions will be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests.
15

Rents from Real Property
Rents we receive from a tenant will qualify as “rents from real property” for the purpose of satisfying the gross income requirements for a REIT described above only if all of the conditions described below are met.

• | The amount of rent is not based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. However, an amount we receive or accrue generally will not be excluded from the term “rents from real property” solely because it is based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales;


• | Neither we nor an actual or constructive owner of 10% or more of our shares actually or constructively owns 10% or more of a tenant from whom we receive rent, other than a TRS. Rents we receive from a TRS will qualify as “rents from real property” as long as the “qualified healthcare property” is operated on behalf of the TRS by an “independent contractor” who is adequately compensated, who does not, directly or through its stockholders, own more than 35% of our shares, taking into account certain ownership attribution rules, and who is, or is related to a person who is, actively engaged in the trade or business of operating “qualified healthcare properties” for any person unrelated to us and our TRS lessee (an “eligible independent contractor”). A “qualified healthcare property” includes any real property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and which is operated by a provider of such services which is eligible for participation in the Medicare program with respect to such facility;


• | Rent attributable to personal property that is leased in connection with a lease of real property is not greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease. If this condition is not met, then the portion of the rent attributable to personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property”; and


• | We generally are not permitted to furnish or render services to our tenants, other than through an “independent contractor” who is adequately compensated and from whom we do not derive revenue. However, we need not provide services through an “independent contractor,” but instead may provide services directly to our tenants, if the services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not considered to be provided for the tenants’ convenience. In addition, we may provide a minimal amount of “non-customary” services to the tenants of a property, other than through an independent contractor, as long as our income from the services (valued at not less than 150% of our direct cost of performing such services) does not exceed 1% of our income from the related property. Further, we may own up to 100% of the stock of a TRS, which may provide customary and non-customary services to our tenants without tainting our rental income for the related properties. See “—Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.”

Interest Income
Interest income constitutes qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the 75% gross income test (as described above) to the extent that the obligation upon which such interest is paid is secured by a mortgage on real property. If we receive interest income with respect to a mortgage loan that is secured by both real property and other property, and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property on the date that we acquired or originated the mortgage loan, the interest income will be apportioned between the real property and the other collateral, and our income from the arrangement will qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test only to the extent that the interest is allocable to the real property. Even if a loan is not secured by real property, or is undersecured, the income that it generates may nonetheless qualify for purposes of the 95% gross income test. For these purposes, the term “interest” generally does not include any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, if the determination of all or some of the amount depends in any way on the income or profits of any person. However, an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales.
Dividend Income
We may directly or indirectly receive distributions from TRSs or other corporations that are not REITs or qualified REIT subsidiaries. These distributions generally are treated as dividend income to the extent of the current and accumulated earnings and profits of the distributing corporation. Such distributions will generally constitute qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test, but not for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Any dividends that we receive from another REIT, however, will be qualifying income for purposes of both the 95% and 75% gross income tests. We will monitor the amounts of dividends and other income from our TRSs and take actions intended to keep such amounts, and any other non-
16

qualifying income, within the limitations of the gross income tests. However, we cannot guarantee that such actions will prevent a violation.
Fee Income
Any fee income that we earn will generally not be qualifying income for purposes of either gross income test. Any fees earned by a TRS, however, will be excluded from our gross income tests.
Failure to Satisfy the Gross Income Tests
If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may still qualify to be taxed as a REIT for such year if we are entitled to relief under applicable provisions of the Code. These relief provisions will be generally available if (i) our failure to meet these tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and (ii) following our identification of the failure to meet the 75% or 95% gross income test for any taxable year, we file a schedule with the IRS setting forth each item of our gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income test for such taxable year in accordance with Treasury regulations, which have not yet been issued. It is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions in all circumstances. If these relief provisions are inapplicable to a particular set of circumstances, we will not qualify to be taxed as a REIT. Even if these relief provisions apply and we retain our status as a REIT, the Code imposes a tax based upon the amount by which we fail to satisfy the particular gross income test. We may not always be able to comply with the gross income tests for REIT qualification despite periodic monitoring of our income.
The Secretary of the Treasury has been given broad authority to determine whether particular items of gain or income qualify or not under the 75% and 95% gross income tests, or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes.
Asset Tests
At the close of each calendar quarter, we must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by some combination of “real estate assets,” cash, cash items, U.S. government securities, and, under some circumstances, debt or equity instruments purchased with new capital. For this purpose, real estate assets include interests in real property and shares of other corporations that qualify as REITs, as well as certain types of mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, the term “real estate assets” also includes (i) personal property securing a mortgage secured by both real property and personal property if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed 15% of the total fair market value of all such property and (ii) personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property for which the rent attributable to personal property is not greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease. In addition, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, if not more than 25% of the value of our total assets is represented by debt instruments of publicly offered REITs, such debt instruments will be treated as real estate assets. Assets that do not qualify for purposes of the 75% asset test are subject to the additional asset tests described below.
Second, the value of any single issuer’s securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets.
Third, we may not own more than 10% of any single issuer’s outstanding securities, as measured by either voting power or value. The 5% and 10% asset tests do not apply to securities of TRSs and qualified REIT subsidiaries and the 10% asset test does not apply to “straight debt” having specified characteristics and to certain other securities described below. Solely for purposes of the 10% asset test, the determination of our interest in the assets of a partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest will be based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership or limited liability company, excluding for this purpose certain securities described in the Code.
Fourth, the aggregate value of all securities of TRSs that we hold, together with other non-qualified assets (such as furniture and equipment or other tangible personal property, or non-real estate securities) may not, in the aggregate, exceed 25% (20% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets.
Notwithstanding the general rule, as noted above, that for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests we are treated as owning our proportionate share of the underlying assets of a subsidiary partnership, if we hold indebtedness issued by a partnership, the indebtedness will be subject to, and may cause a violation of, the asset tests unless the indebtedness is a qualifying mortgage asset or other conditions are met. Similarly, although shares of another REIT are qualifying assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests, any non-mortgage debt that is issued by another REIT may not so qualify (although such debt will not be treated as “securities” for purposes of the 10% asset test, as explained below).
17

Certain securities will not cause a violation of the 10% asset test (for purposes of value) described above. Such securities include instruments that constitute “straight debt,” which term includes, among other things, securities having certain contingency features. A security does not qualify as “straight debt” where a REIT (or a controlled TRS of the REIT) owns other securities of the same issuer which do not qualify as straight debt, unless the value of those other securities constitute, in the aggregate, 1% or less of the total value of that issuer’s outstanding securities. In addition to straight debt, the Code provides that certain other securities will not violate the 10% asset test. Such securities include (i) any loan made to an individual or an estate, (ii) certain rental agreements pursuant to which one or more payments are to be made in subsequent years (other than agreements between a REIT and certain persons related to the REIT under attribution rules), (iii) any obligation to pay rents from real property, (iv) securities issued by governmental entities that are not dependent in whole or in part on the profits of (or payments made by) a non-governmental entity, (v) any security (including debt securities) issued by another REIT and (vi) any debt instrument issued by a partnership if the partnership’s income is of a nature that it would satisfy the 75% gross income test described above under “—Income Tests.” In applying the 10% asset test, a debt security issued by a partnership is not taken into account to the extent, if any, of the REIT’s proportionate interest in the equity and certain debt securities issued by that partnership.
We have not obtained independent appraisals to support our conclusions as to the value of our total assets or the value of any particular security or securities. Moreover, the values of some assets may not be susceptible to a precise determination, and values are subject to change in the future. The proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT asset requirements. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurances that the IRS will not contend that our interests in our subsidiaries or in the securities of other issuers cause a violation of the REIT asset tests.
However, certain relief provisions are available to allow REITs to satisfy the asset requirements or to maintain REIT qualification notwithstanding certain violations of the asset and other requirements. For example, if we fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter, such a failure would not cause us to lose our REIT qualification if we (i) satisfied the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset requirements was not wholly or partially caused by an acquisition of non-qualifying assets, but instead arose from changes in the relative market values of our assets. If the condition described in clause (ii) were not satisfied, we still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose or by making use of the relief provisions described above.
In the case of de minimis violations of the 10% and 5% asset tests, a REIT may maintain its qualification despite a violation of such requirements if (i) the value of the assets causing the violation does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT’s total assets and $10,000,000 and (ii) the REIT either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure, or the relevant tests are otherwise satisfied within that time frame.
Even if we did not qualify for the foregoing relief provisions, a REIT that fails one or more of the asset requirements may nevertheless maintain its REIT qualification if (i) the REIT provides the IRS with a description of each asset causing the failure, (ii) the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, (iii) the REIT pays a tax equal to the greater of (a) $50,000 per failure and (b) the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure multiplied by the maximum corporate tax rate and (iv) the REIT either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure, or otherwise satisfies the relevant asset tests within that time frame.
Annual Distribution Requirements
In order to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to: (i) the sum of (a) 90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to our net capital gains and the deduction for dividends paid; and (b) 90% of our after-tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property (as described below); minus (ii) the excess of the sum of specified items of non-cash income over 5% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to our net capital gain and the deduction for dividends paid.
We generally must make these distributions in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. These distributions generally will be treated as received by our stockholders in the year in which paid.
To the extent that we distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our REIT taxable income, as adjusted, we will be subject to tax at ordinary corporate tax rates on the retained portion. We may elect to retain, rather than distribute, some or all of our net long-term capital gains and pay tax on such gains. In this case, we could elect for our stockholders to include their proportionate shares of such undistributed long-term capital gains in income, and to receive a corresponding credit for their 
18

share of the tax that we paid. Our stockholders would then increase the adjusted basis of their shares by the difference between (i) the amounts of capital gain dividends that we designated and that they include in their taxable income, minus (ii) the tax that we paid on their behalf with respect to that income.
To the extent that in the future we may have available net operating losses carried forward from prior tax years, such losses may reduce the amount of distributions that we must make in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. Such losses, however, will generally not affect the tax treatment to our stockholders of any distributions that are actually made. Please refer to “—Taxation of Stockholders—Distributions.”
If we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our capital gain net income for such year and (iii) any undistributed net taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a non-deductible 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of (a) the amounts actually distributed, plus (b) the amounts of income we retained and on which we have paid corporate income tax.
We expect that our REIT taxable income will be less than our cash flow because of depreciation and other non-cash charges included in computing REIT taxable income. Accordingly, we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirements described above. However, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet these distribution requirements due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, and the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in determining our taxable income. In addition, we may decide to retain our cash, rather than distribute it, in order to repay debt, acquire assets, or for other reasons. If these timing differences occur, we may borrow funds to pay dividends or pay dividends through the distribution of other property (including our shares) in order to meet the distribution requirements, while preserving our cash.
If our taxable income for a particular year is subsequently determined to have been understated, we may be able to rectify a resultant failure to meet the distribution requirements for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year but treated as an additional distribution to our stockholders in the year such dividends are paid. In this case, we may be able to avoid losing REIT qualification or being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, subject to the 4% excise tax described above. We will be required to pay interest based on the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends.
For purposes of the 90% distribution requirement and excise tax described above, any dividend that we declare in October, November or December of any year and that is payable to a stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month will be treated as both paid by us and received by the stockholder on December 31 of such year, provided that we actually pay the dividend before the end of January of the following calendar year.
Prohibited Transactions
Net income that we derive from a prohibited transaction is subject to a 100% tax. The term “prohibited transaction” generally includes a sale or other disposition of property (other than foreclosure property, as discussed below) that is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. We intend to continue to conduct our operations so that no asset that we own (or are treated as owning) will be treated as, or having been, held as inventory or for sale to customers, and that a sale of any such asset will not be treated as having been in the ordinary course of our business. Whether property is held as inventory or “primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business” depends on the particular facts and circumstances. We cannot provide any assurances that any property that we sell will not be treated as inventory or property held for sale to customers, or that we can comply with certain safe harbor provisions of the Code that would prevent such treatment. The 100% tax does not apply to gains from the sale of property that is held through a TRS or other taxable corporation, although such income will be subject to tax in the hands of the corporation at regular corporate rates. We intend to continue to structure our activities to avoid prohibited transaction characterization.
Like-Kind Exchanges
We may dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as like-kind exchanges under the Code. Such like-kind exchanges are intended to result in the deferral of gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The failure of any such transaction to qualify as a like-kind exchange could require us to pay federal income tax, possibly including the 100% prohibited transaction tax, depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transactions.
Derivatives and Hedging Transactions
19

We may enter into hedging transactions with respect to interest rate exposure on one or more of our assets or liabilities. Any such hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts, and options. Except to the extent provided by Treasury regulations, any income from a hedging transaction we enter into (i) in the ordinary course of our business primarily to manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred, to acquire or carry “real estate assets” (as described above under “—Asset Tests”), which is clearly identified as specified in Treasury regulations before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into, including gain from the sale or disposition of a position in such a transaction, (ii) primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the 75% or 95% income tests (or any asset that produces such income) which is clearly identified as such before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into and (iii) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, to hedge the income or loss from prior hedging transactions, where the property or indebtedness which was the subject of the prior hedging transaction was extinguished or disposed of, will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income test. To the extent that we enter into hedging transactions that are not described in the preceding clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), the income from these transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests. Moreover, to the extent that a position in a hedging transaction has positive value at any particular point in time, it may be treated as an asset that does not qualify for purposes of the REIT asset tests. We intend to continue to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. We may conduct some or all of our hedging activities (including hedging activities relating to currency risk) through a TRS or other corporate entity, the income from which may be subject to U.S. federal income tax, rather than by participating in the arrangements directly or through pass-through subsidiaries. We cannot provide any assurances, however, that our hedging activities will not give rise to income or assets that do not qualify for purposes of the REIT tests, or that our hedging activities will not adversely affect our ability to satisfy the REIT qualification requirements.
Foreclosure Property
Foreclosure property is real property and any personal property incident to such real property (i) that we acquire as the result of having bid in the property at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced the property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law, after a default (or upon imminent default) on a lease of the property or a mortgage loan held by us and secured by the property, (ii) for which we acquired the related loan or lease at a time when default was not imminent or anticipated and (iii) with respect to which we made a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property. We generally will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate on any net income from foreclosure property, including any gain from the disposition of the foreclosure property, other than income that would otherwise be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Any gain from the sale of property for which a foreclosure property election has been made will not be subject to the 100% tax on gains from prohibited transactions described above, even if the property would otherwise constitute inventory or dealer property. We do not anticipate receiving any income from foreclosure property that does not qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test.
Penalty Tax
Any re-determined rents, re-determined TRS service income (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015), re-determined deductions, or excess interest we generate will be subject to a 100% penalty tax. In general, re-determined rents are rents from real property that are overstated as a result of any services furnished to any of our tenants by a TRS, re-determined TRS service income represents income of a TRS that is understated as a result of services provided to us or on our behalf and re-determined deductions and excess interest represent any amounts that are deducted by a TRS for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on arm’s-length negotiations or if the interest payments were at a commercially reasonable rate. Rents that we receive will not constitute re-determined rents if they qualify for certain safe harbor provisions contained in the Code.
Failure to Qualify
If we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification other than the income or asset tests, we could avoid disqualification as a REIT if our failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. Relief provisions are also available for failures of the income tests and asset tests, as described above in “—Income Tests” and “—Asset Tests.”
If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and the relief provisions described above do not apply, we would be subject to tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We cannot deduct distributions to stockholders in any year in which we are not a REIT, nor would we be required to make 
20

distributions in such a year. In this situation, to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes), distributions to stockholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends. Such dividends paid to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates may be taxable at the preferential income tax rates (i.e., the 20% maximum U.S. federal rate) for qualified dividends. In addition, subject to the limitations of the Code, corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification. It is not possible to state whether, in all circumstances, we would be entitled to this statutory relief.
Taxation of Stockholders
Taxation of Taxable U.S. Stockholders
The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our shares applicable to taxable U.S. stockholders. A “U.S. stockholder” is any holder of our shares of common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• | An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;


• | A corporation (or entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, or of any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;


• | An estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or


• | A trust if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S. fiduciaries have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.

If a partnership, including for this purpose any entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.
An investor that is a partnership and the partners in such partnership should consult their tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our shares of common stock.
Distributions
So long as we qualify to be taxed as a REIT, the distributions that we make to our taxable U.S. stockholders out of current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that we do not designate as capital gain dividends will generally be taken into account by such stockholders as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporations. With limited exceptions, our dividends are not eligible for taxation at the preferential income tax rates (i.e., the 23.8% maximum U.S. federal income tax rate, including the 3.8% Medicare tax described below) for qualified dividends received by most U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates from taxable C corporations. Such stockholders, however, are taxed at the preferential rates on dividends designated by and received from REITs to the extent that certain holding period requirements have been met and the dividends are attributable to:

• | income retained by the REIT in the prior taxable year on which the REIT was subject to corporate-level income tax (less the amount of tax);


• | dividends received by the REIT from TRSs or other taxable C corporations; or


• | income in the prior taxable year from the sales of “built-in gain” property acquired by the REIT from C corporations in carryover basis transactions (less the amount of corporate tax on such income).

Distributions that we designate as capital gain dividends will generally be taxed to our U.S. stockholders as long-term capital gains, to the extent that such distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year, without regard to the period for which the stockholder that receives such distribution has held its shares, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, may not exceed our dividends paid for the taxable year, including dividends paid the following year that are treated as paid in the current year. We may elect to retain and pay taxes on some or all of our net long-term capital gains, in 
21

which case we may elect to apply provisions of the Code that treat our U.S. stockholders as having received, solely for tax purposes, our undistributed capital gains, and the stockholders as receiving a corresponding credit for taxes that we paid on such undistributed capital gains. Please refer to “—Annual Distribution Requirements.” Corporate stockholders may be required to treat up to 20% of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains are generally taxable at maximum U.S. federal rates of 23.8% in the case of U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates, including the 3.8% Medicare tax described below, and 35% in the case of U.S. stockholders that are corporations. Capital gains attributable to the sale of depreciable real property held for more than 12 months are subject to a 25% maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for taxpayers who are taxed as individuals, to the extent of certain previously claimed depreciation deductions.
Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) will generally represent a return of capital and will not be taxable to a stockholder to the extent that the amount of such distributions does not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder’s shares in respect of which the distributions were made. Rather, the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the stockholder’s shares. To the extent that such distributions exceed the adjusted basis of a stockholder’s shares, the stockholder generally must include such distributions in income as long-term capital gain if the shares have been held for more than one year, or short-term capital gain if the shares have been held for one year or less. In addition, any dividend that we declare in October, November or December of any year and that is payable to a stockholder of record on a specified date in any such month generally will be treated as both paid by us and received by the stockholder on December 31 of such year, provided that we actually pay the dividend before the end of January of the following calendar year.
To the extent that we have available net operating losses and capital losses carried forward from prior tax years, such losses may reduce the amount of distributions that we must make in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. Please refer to “—Annual Distribution Requirements.” Such losses, however, are not passed through to stockholders and do not offset income of stockholders from other sources, nor would such losses affect the character of any distributions that we make, which are generally subject to tax in the hands of stockholders to the extent that we have current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes).
Dispositions of Our Shares
If a U.S. stockholder sells or disposes of our shares, it will generally recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received on the sale or other disposition and the stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares. In general, capital gains recognized by individuals, trusts and estates upon the sale or disposition of our shares will be subject to a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20% if the shares are held for more than one year, and will be taxed at ordinary income rates (of up to 39.6%) if the shares are held for one year or less. Gains recognized by stockholders that are corporations are subject to U.S. federal income tax at a maximum rate of 35%, whether or not such gains are classified as long-term capital gains. Capital losses recognized by a U.S. stockholder upon the disposition of our shares that were held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long-term capital losses, and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may also offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year). In addition, any loss upon a sale or exchange of our shares by a U.S. stockholder who has held the shares for six months or less, after applying holding period rules, will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of actual or deemed distributions that we make that are required to be treated by the stockholder as long-term capital gain.
If a U.S. stockholder recognizes a loss upon a subsequent disposition of our shares or other securities in an amount that exceeds a prescribed threshold, it is possible that the provisions of Treasury regulations involving “reportable transactions” could apply, with a resulting requirement to separately disclose the loss-generating transaction to the IRS. These regulations, though directed towards “tax shelters,” are broadly written and apply to transactions that would not typically be considered tax shelters. The Code imposes significant penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. You should consult your tax advisor concerning any possible disclosure obligation with respect to the receipt or disposition of our shares or securities or transactions that we might undertake directly or indirectly. Moreover, you should be aware that we and other participants in the transactions in which we are involved (including their advisors) might be subject to disclosure or other requirements pursuant to these regulations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
A U.S. stockholder may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information reporting and/or backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) with respect to distributions on our shares, and depending on the circumstances, the proceeds of a sale or other taxable disposition of our shares. Under the backup withholding rules, you may be subject to backup withholding at a current rate of 28% with respect to distributions unless you: (1) are a corporation or come within certain other exempt 
22

categories and, when required, demonstrate this fact; or (2) provide a taxpayer identification number, certify as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding, and otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount withheld under these rules will be refunded or credited against your federal income tax liability, provided that you timely furnish the IRS with certain required information.
Passive Activity Losses and Investment Interest Limitations
Distributions that we make and gains arising from the sale or exchange by a U.S. stockholder of our shares will not be treated as passive activity income. As a result, stockholder will not be able to apply any “passive losses” against income or gain relating to our shares. To the extent that distributions we make do not constitute a return of capital, they will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation.
Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders
The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our shares applicable to non-U.S. stockholders. A “non-U.S. stockholder” is any holder of our common equity other than a partnership or U.S. stockholder. The following discussion is based on current law, and is for general information only. It addresses only selected, and not all, aspects of U.S. federal income taxation.
Ordinary Dividends
Distributions received by non-U.S. stockholders that are (i) payable out of our earnings and profits, (ii) not attributable to capital gains that we recognize and (iii) not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. stockholder, will be dividends that are subject to U.S. withholding tax at the rate of 30%, unless that rate is reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty or such dividends are paid to a foreign government or an integral part or controlled entity (other than a controlled commercial entity) thereof (“Foreign Government”).
Because in general we will not know whether a distribution at any particular time will be from our earning and profits and will therefore be treated as a dividend, we expect to withhold federal income tax at the rate of 30% on any distributions made to a non-U.S. stockholder unless:

• | a lower treaty rate applies and the non-U.S. stockholder provides an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-BEN-E (or applicable successor form) evidencing eligibility for that reduced treaty rate;


• | the non-U.S. stockholder is a Foreign Government and provides an IRS Form W-8EXP (or applicable successor form) to that effect; or


• | the non-U.S. stockholder provides an IRS Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the distribution is income effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholder’s trade or business.

In general, non-U.S. stockholders will not be considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business solely as a result of their ownership of our shares. In cases where the dividend income from a non-U.S. stockholder’s investment in our shares is, or is treated as, effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the non-U.S. stockholder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at graduated rates, in the same manner as U.S. stockholders are taxed with respect to such dividends. Such effectively connected income must generally be reported on a U.S. income tax return filed by or on behalf of the non-U.S. stockholder. The income may also be subject to a branch profits tax at the rate of 30% (unless reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty) in the case of a non-U.S. stockholder that is a corporation.
Treatment of Our Shares as United States Real Property Interests; Exceptions
We expect that more than 50% of our assets will consist of “United States real property interests” (“USRPIs”) and that we will accordingly meet the general definition of a “United States real property holding company” (“USRPHC”) under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”). The general rule is that shares of a USRPHC are themselves USRPIs and that gains realized with respect to such shares by non-U.S. stockholders are therefore subject to taxation under FIRPTA.
However, so long as we continue to qualify as a REIT our shares will not be treated as USRPIs if we are “domestically controlled.” We will be “domestically controlled” if less than 50% of the value of our stock is held by foreign persons during 
23

the shorter of the preceding five years or the period of our existence (“FIRPTA Testing Period”). For purposes of determining whether a REIT is a “domestically controlled,” a person who at all applicable times holds less than 5% of a class of stock that is “regularly traded” will be treated as a U.S. person, unless the REIT has actual knowledge that such person is not a U.S. person. We believe that we are currently “domestically controlled.” However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will remain so.
In addition, even if we are not “domestically controlled,” any of our shares in a class that is “regularly traded on an established securities market” will not constitute USRPIs in the hands of any foreign person that owns 10% or less of such class during the FIRPTA Testing Period.
Non-Dividend Distributions
Unless our shares constitute USRPIs as to a particular non-U.S. stockholder, distributions that we make that are not dividends (because they exceed our earnings and profits) will not be subject to U.S. income tax. If we nevertheless withhold tax from such distributions, a non-U.S. stockholder may seek a refund from the IRS of any amounts withheld. If our shares constitute a USRPI because they are not within one of the exceptions to such treatment described above, distributions that we make in excess of the sum of (i) the stockholder’s proportionate share of our earnings and profits, plus (ii) the stockholder’s basis in its stock, will be taxed under FIRPTA, at the applicable capital gains tax rate that would apply to a U.S. stockholder of the same type (i.e., an individual or a corporation, as the case may be).
USRPI Gains; Distributions
We may realize gains from the sale of real property (“USRPI Gains”) that are taxable to non-U.S. stockholders under FIRPTA upon their distribution. To the extent that we make a distribution to a non-U.S. stockholder that is attributable to USRPI Gains, that distribution will, except as described below, be treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. stockholder and will be subject to U.S. income tax at the same rates applicable to U.S. taxpayers.
In addition, we may be required to withhold tax equal to 35% of any distribution to a non-U.S. stockholder to the extent that distribution is attributable to USRPI Gains. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a branch profits tax at the rate of 30% (unless reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty) if they are made to a non-U.S. stockholder that is a corporation.
The foregoing rules are subject to a significant exception. A distribution that would otherwise have been treated as attributable to USRPI Gains will not be so treated or be subject to FIRPTA, and generally will be treated in the same manner as an ordinary dividend would be treated (please refer to “—Ordinary Dividends,” above), if (i) the distribution is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States and (ii) the recipient non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 10% of that class of stock at any time during the year ending on the date on which the distribution is received. Furthermore, distributions to “qualified foreign pension funds” generally will be exempt from FIRPTA. Non-U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules.
Dispositions of Our Shares
Unless our shares constitute USRPIs, a sale of our shares by a non-U.S. stockholder generally will not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA. See “—Treatment of Our Shares as United States Real Property Interests; Exceptions,” above, for a description of the circumstances in which our shares will constitute USRPIs. If gain on the sale of our shares were subject to taxation under FIRPTA, the non-U.S. stockholder would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return and would be subject to the same treatment as a U.S. stockholder with respect to such gain, subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of non-resident alien individuals. Moreover, in order to enforce the collection of the tax, the purchaser of the shares could be required to withhold 15% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the IRS.
Gain from the sale of our shares that would not otherwise be subject to FIRPTA will nonetheless be taxable in the United States to a non-U.S. stockholder in two cases: (i) if the non-U.S. stockholder’s investment in our shares is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by such non-U.S. stockholder, the non-U.S. stockholder will be subject to the same treatment as a U.S. stockholder with respect to such gain, except that a non-U.S. stockholder that is a corporation may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (unless reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty), or (ii) if the non-U.S. stockholder is a non-resident alien individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the United States, the non-resident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual’s capital gain.

Qualified Foreign Pension Funds
Gains derived from USRPIs held by “qualified foreign pension funds” or entities all of the interests of which are held by “qualified foreign pension funds,” and distributions attributable to USRPI Gains that we make to such stockholders will be exempt from FIRPTA. However, such shareholders will remain subject to withholding on ordinary dividends. See “—Ordinary Dividends.”
Non-U.S. stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax consequences of owning our shares.
Taxation of Tax-Exempt Stockholders
Tax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts, generally are exempt from U.S. federal income taxation. However, they may be subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). While some investments in real estate may generate UBTI, the IRS has ruled that dividend distributions from a REIT to a tax-exempt entity do not constitute UBTI. Based on that ruling, and provided that (i) a tax-exempt stockholder has not held our shares as “debt financed property” within the meaning of the Code (i.e., where the acquisition or holding of the property is financed through a borrowing by the tax-exempt stockholder) and (ii) our shares are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business, distributions that we make and income from the sale of our shares generally should not give rise to UBTI to a tax-exempt stockholder.
Tax-exempt stockholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified group legal services plans exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under Sections 501(c)(7), (c)(9), (c)(17) and (c)(20) of the Code are subject to different UBTI rules, which generally require such stockholders to characterize distributions that we make as UBTI.
In certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our shares could be required to treat a percentage of any dividends received from us as UBTI if we are a “pension-held REIT.” We will not be a pension-held REIT unless (i) we are required to “look through” one or more of our pension trust stockholders in order to satisfy the REIT “closely held” test and (ii) either (a) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the value of our shares or (b) one or more pension trusts, each individually holding more than 10% of the value of our shares, collectively own more than 50% of the value of our shares. Certain restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares generally should prevent a tax-exempt entity from owning more than 10% of the value of our shares and generally should prevent us from becoming a pension-held REIT.
Tax-exempt stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax consequences of owning our shares.
Other Tax Considerations
Legislative or Other Actions Affecting REITs
The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time. The REIT rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the Treasury which may result in statutory changes as well as revisions to regulations and interpretations. Changes to the U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect an investment in our common stock.
Medicare 3.8% Tax on Investment Income
Certain U.S. stockholders who are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be required to pay a 3.8% Medicare tax on dividends and certain other investment income, including capital gains from the sale or other disposition of our common equity.
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Withholding taxes may be imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (“FATCA”) on certain types of payments made to non-U.S. financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on dividends on, or (after December 31, 2018) gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, our common equity paid to a “foreign financial institution” or a “non-financial 
25

foreign entity” (each as defined in the Code), unless (i) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations, (ii) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any “substantial United States owners” (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner, or (iii) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements in (i) above, it must enter into an agreement with the Treasury requiring that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain “specified United States persons” or “United States-owned foreign entities” (each as defined in the Code), annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules.
We will not pay any additional amounts to stockholders in respect of any amounts withheld. Non-U.S. stockholders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on their investment in our common equity.
State, Local and Foreign Taxes
We and our subsidiaries and stockholders may be subject to state, local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business, own property or reside, and we or they may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or foreign tax treatment and that of our stockholders may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax treatment discussed above. Any foreign taxes that we incur do not pass through to stockholders as a credit against their U.S. federal income tax liability. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application and effect of state, local and foreign income and other tax laws on an investment in our shares.
