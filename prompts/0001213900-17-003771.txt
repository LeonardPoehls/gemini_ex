Item 1. Business.
Introduction
 
Omagine, Inc. (“Omagine” or the “Registrant”) was incorporated in Delaware in October 2004 and is a holding company which conducts substantially all its operations through its 60% owned subsidiary Omagine LLC, an Omani limited liability corporation (“LLC”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Journey of Light, Inc., a New York corporation (“JOL”). Omagine and JOL are collectively referred to herein as “OMAG” and Omagine, JOL and LLC are collectively referred to herein as the “Company”.
 
The Company is focused on entertainment, hospitality and real estate development opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa (the “MENA Region”) and on the design and development of distinctive tourism destinations. The Company presently concentrates the majority of its efforts on the business of LLC and specifically on the Omagine Project. Omagine, Inc. has 22,042,120 shares of its Common Stock issued and outstanding as of April 13, 2017.
 
In November 2009, Omagine organized LLC as a wholly owned subsidiary under the laws of the Sultanate of Oman (“Oman”) to design, develop, own and operate our initial project – a mixed-use tourism and real estate project named the “Omagine Project” (See “The Omagine Project” below). In October 2014, LLC and the Government of Oman (the “Government”) signed an agreement (the “Development Agreement” or “DA”) for the development in Oman by LLC of the Omagine Project (See: Exhibits 10.7 and 99.1 and “The Development Agreement and the Usufruct Agreement”, below). On July 2, 2015, after the Usufruct Agreement (“UA”) was registered by the Government legally perfecting LLC’s ownership of the Land Rights, the Government and LLC entered into an agreement (the “Operative Agreement”) making July 1, 2015 the “Operative Date” from which all time periods for the execution by LLC of various tasks enumerated in the DA are to be measured.
 
Omagine initially capitalized LLC at Omani Rials (“OR”) 20,000 [$52,000] and in 2011 Omagine’s 100% ownership of LLC was reduced to 60% pursuant to a shareholders’ agreement (the “Shareholder Agreement”) signed in May 2011 by Omagine, JOL and three new LLC minority investors (See: Exhibit 10.6 and “The Shareholder Agreement” below).
 
As of the date hereof, the shareholders of Omagine LLC (the “LLC Shareholders”) are:
 

i. | Omagine, Inc. and 
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. | Royal Court Affairs (“RCA”), an organization representing the personal interests of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, the ruler of Oman, and 
iii. | Two subsidiaries of Consolidated Contractors International Company, SAL (“CCIC”). CCIC is a 65 year old Lebanese multi-national company headquartered in Athens, Greece having worldwide and operating subsidiaries in among other places, every country in the MENA Region. In its fiscal years immediately prior to 2016, CCIC had approximately five (5) billion U.S. dollars in annual revenue and one hundred thirty thousand (130,000) employees but management’s best information at this time is that both CCIC’s revenue and number of employees have since been dramatically reduced as a result of adverse economic conditions in the MENA Region (See: “Market Conditions” below). The two CCIC subsidiaries which are LLC shareholders are: 


a. | Consolidated Contracting Company S.A. (“CCC-Panama”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CCIC, and 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. | Consolidated Contractors Oman Company LLC (“CCC-Oman”), CCIC’s operating subsidiary in Oman.

CCC-Panama and CCC-Oman are sometimes referred to collectively in this report as “CCC”.
 All efforts to date to conclude the CCC-Contract and CCC’s required investment were fruitless. On April 3, 2017 Omagine exercised its option to purchase all of the shares of LLC owned by CCC-Oman and CCC-Panama. After the closing of the option purchase LLC will then have only two shareholders – Omagine and RCA.
 The only matter preventing forward progress on the Omagine Project is securing an agreement with an investor to replace the CCC investment. As previously reported, management has a signed written agreement (an “Investment Agreement”) with one such investor.
 The Investment Agreement is for an amount in excess of the aggregate investment which was to be made by CCC-Oman and CCC-Panama. This binding Investment Agreement was signed by LLC and the investor in November 2016 and contemplated the funding of the investment in January 2017. Subsequent to entering into this Investment Agreement, the investor unfortunately and unexpectedly passed away.
 The investor’s heirs have acknowledged the validity of the Investment Agreement and have agreed to fulfil their father’s commitment pursuant to it as soon as his estate (which we understand to be quite substantial and complicated) is settled. LLC management has been dealing with the investor’s heirs since December 2016 and our understanding from them is that their father’s estate will be settled “soon”. Management cannot say with certainty what the term “soon” means in this case as the heirs have frequently indicated to us that the estate settlement was imminent – but delays have ensued. Management is continuing its efforts to close the investment transaction memorialized by the Investment Agreement but no assurance can be given to investors and shareholders that such investment transaction will actually occur until it actually does occur.
 Also as previously disclosed, management has been holding discussions in parallel with several other potential LLC investors. As of the date hereof, we are awaiting the conclusion of the estate settlement mentioned above and we are in final discussions with two European investment funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shareholders and investors are again cautioned that until an investment transaction as generally described above actually closes LLC will not have the funding sufficient to begin work on the Omagine Project and no assurance can be given at this time that any such investment transaction will be finally consummated.
 RCA and Omagine intend to amend the Shareholder Agreement as necessary to memorialize any such new investment by a new investor when and if it occurs (an “Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement”). Serious design, development and construction activities on the Omagine Project can begin only after such Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement is signed by the parties. 
 Management has also been conducting parallel project finance discussions with a bank and we expect a successful conclusion to that discussion to occur soon after we close an investment with a new investor and the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement is executed. 
 As these matters unfold, management will report all material developments and agreements to its shareholders in a timely manner. 
 Management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Investors and shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement or forecast, which speaks only as of the date hereof. 
 The Shareholder Agreement 
Upon organizing Omagine LLC in 2009, Omagine made an initial cash investment into LLC of OR 20,000 [$52,000] in consideration for the issuance to Omagine of 200,000 LLC Shares. 
 Pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement: 
 
i. | Before the DA was signed and after the execution of the Shareholder Agreement, the LLC Shareholders purchased an aggregate of 1,300,000 LLC Shares for an aggregate cash investment of OR 130,000 [$338,000], as follows: 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


a) | Omagine purchased an additional 700,000 LLC Shares for OR 70,000 [$182,000] in cash, and 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) | RCA purchased 375,000 LLC Shares for OR 37,500 [$97,500] in cash, and 
c) | CCC-Panama purchased 150,000 LLC Shares for OR 15,000 [$39,000] in cash, and CCC-Oman purchased 75,000 LLC Shares for OR 7,500 [$19,500] in cash (collectively, the “225,000 Initial CCC Shares”).

ii. | After the DA was signed on October 2, 2014, Omagine purchased an additional 2,100,000 LLC Shares for an additional investment by Omagine of OR 210,000 [$546,000] in cash, and 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | On July 2, 2015, RCA purchased an additional 663,750 LLC Shares in consideration for the non-cash investment by RCA of the Land Rights valued at OR 276,666,667 [$718,614,000]. 
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The construction contract with CCC-OMAN was not signed and the investments required pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement from CCC-Oman and CCC-Panama were not received by LLC. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Shareholder Agreement, Omagine, Inc. has the option (the “OMAG Option”) to purchase the 225,000 Initial CCC Shares from CCC for 22,500 Omani Rials ($58,500). (See: the Shareholder Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.6). On April 3, 2017 Omagine exercised its option to purchase all of the shares of LLC owned by CCC-Oman and CCC-Panama.
 
As of December 31, 2016 and the date hereof the LLC shareholders have made cash investments into LLC as indicated in the following Table A:

The foregoing summary of some of the terms of the Shareholder Agreement and does not purport to be complete and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the SHA. The full text of the SHA is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.6. RCA and Omagine are presently in negotiations with investors which may lead to an Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement.
 
The Omagine Project
 
The Omagine Project is a mixed-use tourism and residential real estate project. Subject to normal and customary scheduling changes during its development and construction and to the current delays encountered in getting the CCC-Contract signed, the Omagine Project is now planned to be completed in late 2022. It is being developed on one million square meters (equal to 100 hectares or approximately 245 acres) of beachfront land (the “Existing Land”) facing the Gulf of Oman just west of Oman’s capital city of Muscat and approximately six miles from Muscat International Airport. Present development plans envision the creation of approximately a net additional 106,000 square meters of “Reclaimed Land” which together with the Existing Land will comprise approximately 1,106,000 square meters of land (the “Project Land”). The Omagine Project will require substantial Project Finance to complete (See: “The Shareholder Agreement”, above and “Financial Advisor”, below).
 
The Omagine Project is planned to be an elegant integration of cultural, scientific, heritage, entertainment and residential components, including seven pearl shaped (20 meter diameter) buildings (the “Pearls”) located along an open boardwalk with associated entertainment exhibitions; an amphitheater and stage; green landscaped spaces; a canal; an enclosed harbor and marina; boat slips and docking facilities; retail shops; a variety of restaurants, cafes and entertainment venues; a five-star resort hotel; a four-star hotel; and possibly an additional three or four-star hotel; shopping and retail establishments integrated with the hotels; commercial office buildings; and more than two thousand elegant residences to be developed for sale by LLC. The ethos of the project is elegant but relaxed entertainment and the Company expects that the Pearls will become “the Landmark” for the Sultanate of Oman.

Pursuant to Omani Law, non-Omani persons are not permitted to purchase land in Oman unless such land is located within an Integrated Tourism Project (“ITC”) such as the Omagine Project. The Government has designated the Omagine Project as an ITC and has issued a license to LLC (an “ITC License”) thereby permitting the sale by LLC of the freehold title to the Project Land and to properties developed on the Project Land to any person, including any non-Omani person. Since the Omagine Project will contain significant hospitality (hotels), retail, commercial, and entertainment elements, LLC’s business operations are expected over time to encompass real estate development, hospitality, entertainment and property management.
 
The Development Agreement and the Usufruct Agreement 
 
Omagine’s 60% (75% after the closing of the CCC Option transaction) owned subsidiary, LLC, signed a Development Agreement (“DA”) with the Government of Oman in October 2014 for the development in Oman by LLC of the Omagine Project. The legal effectiveness of the DA was conditional upon its ratification by Oman’s Ministry of Finance which Ratification occurred in March 2015. On July 1, 2015 (the “Operative Date”), the Government and LLC entered into a Usufruct Agreement (“UA”) with respect to the Land Rights over the Existing Land and the DA and UA extend such Land Rights to all of the Project Land.
 
On July 2, 2015, after the UA was registered by the Government legally perfecting LLC’s ownership of the Land Rights, the Ministry of Tourism (“MOT”) of the Government and LLC entered into an agreement (the “Operative Agreement”) making July 1, 2015 the “Operative Date” from which all time periods for the execution by LLC of various tasks enumerated in the DA are to be measured. In the Operative Agreement MOT states in relevant part: “We ask you to receive the land and begin procedures for executing the project as per the development agreement entered into with you, keeping in mind that the effective commencement date of the development agreement is 1 July 2015”. The Operative Date is the date from which all time periods for the execution by LLC of various tasks enumerated in the DA are to be measured (See Exhibits 10.8 and 99.2).
 
The DA and UA are the contracts that govern the design, development, construction, management and ownership of the Omagine Project, the use and sale by LLC of the Project Land, and the Government’s and LLC’s rights and obligations with respect to the Omagine Project. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of the DA and the terms and conditions of the UA, the terms and conditions of the DA control (See Exhibits 10.7, 99.1, 10.8 and 99.2). The term of the DA is 20 years and the term of the UA is 50 years (renewable) commencing from the Operative Date. The UA and those DA provisions relevant to the UA survive the expiration of the term of the DA.
 
The Land Rights owned by LLC give it extensive rights over the Project Land including the right to sell such Project Land on a freehold basis. LLC may use, control, develop, retain, operate and/or sell the approximately 1.1 million square meters of Project Land to itself or to third parties. The DA obligates LLC to pay the Government twenty-five (25) Omani Rials ($65) for each square meter of Project Land purchased directly by LLC or sold by LLC to any third party (the “Land Price”). The average valuation for the Land Rights (net of such Land Price is OR 276,666,667 ($718,614,000) (See: “The Land Rights”, below).
 
The five year period commencing on the Operative Date is a rent free period (the “Rent Free Period”) and thereafter LLC will pay annual rent to the Government (the “Land Rent”) based on only the built but unsold commercial area (excluding the residential area) of the Omagine Project (approximately 150,000 sq. meters) or approximately OR 45,000 ($117,000) per year based on the current annual per square meter fee of OR 0.300 ($0.78). No Land Rent is due or owing during the Rent Free Period and no Land Rent is ever due or owing with respect to plots of Project Land (i) on which there is a residential building, or (ii) on which there is not a substantially completed non-residential building (i.e. Project Land that is open space, roads, non-residential building work-in-progress, etc. are rent-free).

The continued legal effectiveness of the DA subsequent to the Operative Date is dependent upon certain milestone dates being achieved (any or all of which may be extended or waived by the Government), including: (1) LLC’s delivery to the Government by June 30, 2016 of a term sheet with lenders for the financing of the first or any other phase of the Project, [this milestone date was achieved by the term sheet and financing agreement which LLC received from the Qatari Bank in November 2015], (2) LLC’s submission to the Ministry of Tourism of a social impact assessment by March 31, 2016 and the Government’s approval thereof by June 30, 2016, (3) the Government’s approval by June 30, 2016 of the development control plan for the Omagine Project, and (4) the transformation of LLC into a joint stock company by June 30, 2016 (these milestone dates 2, 3 and 4 are not yet achieved and are expected to be extended as mentioned above if and when the Operative Date is extended). LLC has suffered many delays as a result of the CCC matters and we are presently assured by Government officials that the Operative Date will be extended by MOT provided we are able to close the necessary investment with a replacement investor for CCC. No assurance can be given at this time however that the Operative Date will be so extended.
 
LLC management and RCA have met with and spoken to the staff at the Ministry of Tourism and with the Minister several times during the period from December 2016 to the date hereof in regard to our efforts to finalize the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement with the estate of our proposed new investor as well as in regard to the delays encountered to date by LLC in meeting certain DA milestone dates as measured from the Operative Date. The MOT (and all Government Ministries) are also acutely aware of the unusual fiscal strains imposed on the present banking and economic environments in the region. While no conclusive extension of the Operative Date has yet been made, as noted above we have continued to keep both the Minister and the staff updated and LLC management and RCA presently expect that the Operative Date will be extended once we finalize our ongoing negotiations and agreements with our proposed new investor. No assurance can be given however to what extent, if any, that the Operative Date will in fact be extended by MOT. 
 
Pursuant to the DA, LLC must substantially complete the construction of the seven Pearl buildings and one hotel (the “Minimum Build Obligation” or “MBO”) by June 30, 2020 (the “MBO Completion Date”), as such date may be amended or extended per the DA as indicated above. The DA imposes no performance timelines on LLC with respect to completing the development or construction of elements of the Omagine Project other than the MBO but the completion of the MBO will require LLC to obtain the necessary Project Finance to do so. Any material breach by LLC of its obligation to perform the MBO would constitute an event of default under the DA. The DA specifies that the principal construction contract (i.e. the CCC Contract) should be executed by June 30, 2016. This did not happen as indicated above. LLC is required to provide written notice to the Government in certain circumstances, such as LLC’s change in an anticipated milestone date that would result in a substantial achievement of work to occur later than 60 days after such milestone date. Such notice has been communicated both verbally and in writing to the appropriate government officials in recent communications with them. 
 
The Company undertook and financed many development activities on behalf of LLC subsequent to the DA signing (the “Initial Activities”) in an effort to fast-track the Omagine Project’s development. The fast-track advantages sought to be gained thereby however have not materialized due to LLC’s failure to utilize the $25 million Al-Rayan Loan to finance the Initial Activities, LLC’s ongoing operations in Oman, and LLC’s previously disclosed Phase One design and construction activities (See: our previous disclosures in prior reports filed with the SEC). The cause of such failure was CCC’s failure to make its Deferred Cash Investment into LLC as required after the November 2015 Financing Agreement Date after initially agreeing to do so and the extended and drawn out and ultimately futile negotiations with CCC relevant to the CCC-Oman construction contract (to which CCC often initially agreed and later changed its mind).
 
Because of these delays therefore, the more serious and substantial design, masterplanning and construction activities for the Omagine Project did not begin in December 2015 as required for the fast-track development strategy and as management had planned. (See: “Initial Activities” and “Pre-Development Expenses and Loans and Advances to LLC”, below). The design, development and construction of the Omagine Project will still benefit from these Initial Activities having been undertaken but not to the extent envisioned by our planned fast-track development approach.
 
Non-Omani persons (such as expatriates living and working in Oman) are not permitted by Omani law to purchase land or residences in Oman outside of an ITC. The Government’s designation and licensing of the Omagine Project as an ITC therefore permits LLC to sell the freehold title to Project Land and properties which are developed on Project Land to any Omani or non-Omani individual or juristic person worldwide. Properties within an ITC enjoy a premium price relative to properties not in an ITC. Any Project Land or buildings remaining unsold at the expiration of the 50 year Usufruct Term will revert to the Government. LLC does not anticipate that there will be any such unsold properties at the expiration of the 50 year Usufruct Term.

The foregoing summary of some of the terms of the DA and of the UA does not purport to be complete and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full texts of such agreements. The full text of the Development Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibits 10.7 and 99.1. The full text of the Usufruct Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibits 10.8 and 99.2 and also contained in Schedule 2A of the Development Agreement.
 
The Land Rights 
 
The value of the Project Land has been determined by three highly experienced professional valuation firms in accordance with the requirements and procedures specified for such a valuation by (i) the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) of London, England, and (ii) International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). Each of the three firms has a worldwide brand in the real estate valuation business.

● | In November 2014, LLC engaged the Oman office of Savills (http://www.savills.com/ (“Savills”) operating as Arabian Real Estate LLC (http://www.savills.om). Savills provides real estate services from over 600 offices worldwide, is listed on the London Stock Exchange, and is a FTSE 250 Index company. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In December 2014, LLC engaged DTZ International Ltd., a Dubai, UAE firm with extensive experience in Oman (http://www.dtzglobal.com) (“DTZ”). DTZ is one of the top three global commercial real estate service companies, with more than 28,000 employees operating across more than 260 offices in 50 countries and $63 billion in transaction volume. 
● | In January 2015, LLC engaged Jones Lang LaSalle, UAE Limited, Dubai Branch (http://www.jll-mena.com/mena/en-gb/locations/Our-locations-in-MENA/dubai) (“JLL”). JLL has 53,000 employees operating across more than 230 offices in 80 countries. 

 
The Savills and DTZ final valuation reports were received by LLC in January 2015. The JLL final valuation report was received by LLC in July 2015. The Company is of the opinion that JLL’s valuation is flawed and most probably represents a statistical outlier. In an abundance of caution however, management has nevertheless determined to include the JLL valuation in its calculation of the average value of LLC’s Land Rights. The Land Rights valuations by the three aforementioned firms are summarized in the table below:
 

Land Rights Valuation 
-------------------------
Valuation Firm | Omani Rials 
Savills | OR 295,000,000 
DTZ | OR 385,000,000 
JLL | OR 150,000,000 
Average | OR 276,666,667 

 
In view of the changing economic conditions in the MENA Region due to the fall in oil prices, LLC may commission an updated land valuation in the coming months.
 
The Accounting Treatment for the Land Rights
 
Omagine and JOL prepare their financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”) and the Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. LLC’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
 
LLC has land under development valued at 276,666,667 Omani Rials. Based on a $2.5974 per 1 Omani Rial exchange rate, the Company recorded this land under development in its financial statements at $718,614,000 and the Company has allocated this amount as follows: 188,963,334 Omani Rials ($490,813,363 based on a $2.5974 per 1 Omani Rial exchange rate) to inventory; and 87,703,333 Omani Rials ($227,800,637 based on a $2.5974 per 1 Omani Rial exchange rate) to property. This land under development was purchased by LLC on July 2, 2015 pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement whereby an LLC shareholder subscribed for 663,750 LLC Shares at a purchase price equal to the value of the Land Rights. Since the Land Rights represented a non-cash payment-in-kind for the LLC Shares, it was necessary to value the Land Rights.

--

 

Three expert real estate valuation companies were engaged by LLC to independently value the Land Rights in accordance with the professional standards specified by RICS and IFRS. The average of the three Land Rights valuations was OR 276,666,667. (See: “The Land Rights”, above and Exhibits 99.4, 99.5 and 99.6).
 
Since the 276,666,667 Omani Rial value of the Land Rights is substantial, LLC retained the services of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) to provide its written analysis and report to LLC with respect to the correct IFRS accounting method LLC should use to record the 276,666,667 Omani Rial Land Rights value in its IFRS compliant financial statements. PwC did not advise on the valuation of the Land Rights (as determined by Savills, DTZ and JLL), but only on the correct accounting LLC should use to record such Land Rights valuation in LLC’s financial statements in accordance with IFRS. PwC’s written report was received by LLC in August 2015. Promptly thereafter, LLC consulted with its independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche (M.E.) & Co. LLC (“Deloitte”) with respect to the matter, and Deloitte’s written technical analysis report (which agreed with PwC’s analysis) was received by LLC in November 2015.
 
The Land Rights over the Project Land are extensive, are closely akin to ownership rights and include the right to sell such land on a freehold basis. The Land Rights are virtually equivalent to ownership rights and like any asset, if its value were to become impaired for any reason (including any contractual reason pursuant to the DA requirements), a reserve for such impairment would need to be established at such time. Although it is not required to do so, in view of the unsettled economic environment in Oman and the greater MENA Region and because of the inordinate delays in resolving the CCC matters and obtaining a replacement investor for CCC, LLC plans to update its land valuation when it has the resources to do so to verify if any material changes in the value of the Project Land may have occurred since the above three valuation reports were completed. Consideration of the foregoing concerns may possibly require the establishment of such a reserve for impairment. Management’s decision as to whether or not to undertake such updated reports and/or whether or not to establish such a reserve will depend to a large extent upon management’s assessment at the time of the likelihood of securing a replacement investor for CCC and the economic conditions in Oman. Both PwC and Deloitte independently concluded that the Land Rights should be recorded as capital and as tangible assets (work-in-process inventory and land) on LLC’s financial statements. With respect to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company’s independent auditor in the U.S. has likewise concurred that pursuant to US GAAP, the Land Rights should be recorded as capital, inventory and land. 
 
In determining the proper amounts to be allocated to inventory and to land, LLC calculated the percentage (x) by dividing (y) the area of the land LLC presently plans definitively to sell, by (z) the total area of the Project Land, and then multiplying that percentage (x) by 276,666,667 Omani Rials to get the number (N) for inventory. The amount to be allocated to property was then calculated by subtracting N from 276,666,667 Omani Rials. Using its detailed internal financial model, management calculated (x) to be equal to 68.3%, thereby making the inventory number (N) equal to 188,963,334 Omani Rials ($490,813,363 based on a $2.5974 per 1 Omani Rial exchange rate) and the property number equal to 87,703,333 Omani Rials ($227,800,637 based on a $2.5974 per 1 Omani Rial exchange rate). In its consolidated financial statements therefore, the Company has allocated the value of the Land Rights between (i) land under development which is held for sale (inventory), and (ii) land under development which is held for investment (PP&E). As more precise land use percentages emerge during and after the masterplanning and construction of the Omagine Project, the percentage allocations for the value of the Land Rights may be reclassified to distinguish between the land underlying properties that we will own and operate and those which we will own and lease.
 
Pre-Development Expenses and Loans and Advances to LLC 
 
Prior to the DA being signed, Omagine incurred significant costs related to marketing, planning, concept design, re-design, feasibility studies, engineering, financing, promotions, capital raising, travel, legal fees, consulting and professional fees, other general and administrative activities and similar such activities including preparing and making presentations to the Government and to potential investors and all other activities and matters associated with the negotiation and conclusion of the DA with the Government (collectively, the “Pre-Development Expenses”). The Shareholder Agreement defines the “Pre-Development Expense Amount” as the total amount of such Pre-Development Expenses incurred before the DA was signed by the Government and LLC on October 2, 2014.
 

12
--

 

Omagine, Inc. expended $17,920,114 to pay for 100% of the Pre-Development Expense Amount.
 
Subsequent to the October 2, 2014 DA signing date and as of December 31, 2016, Omagine, Inc. has voluntarily - and without any obligation to do so - single-handedly kept the Omagine Project and Omagine LLC financially afloat by expending an additional $11.7 million on behalf of the Omagine Project via Loans and Advances to LLC.
 
A summary of the Pre-Development Expense Amount and of the Loans and Advances is detailed in the following table:
 
Pre-Development Expenses, Loans and Advances
 

 | Cash Items | | Non-Cash Items | | | Total
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------+------------+----------------+---+------------+------
Pre-Development Expense Amount (incurred prior to the October 2, 2014 DA signing date) | $ | 13,611,951 | | $ | 4,308,163 | | $ | 17,920,114
Loans & Advances (incurred on or after the October 2, 2014 DA signing date) | $ | 4,303,869 | | $ | 7,393,473 | | $ | 11,697,342
Total Due to Omagine, Inc. from Omagine LLC | $ | 17,915,820 | | $ | 11,701,636 | | $ | 29,617,456

 
The Pre-Development Expense Amount and the Loans and Advances are, or will be, liabilities of LLC; reimbursable to Omagine, Inc. in accordance with the terms of the Shareholder Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement now being negotiated may change the presently existing terms and conditions of the existing Shareholder Agreement with respect to the payment of the Pre-Development Expense Amount and the Loans and Advances. 
 
The Pre-Development Expense Amount 
 
Pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement as presently in effect, the date subsequent to the first Financing Agreement Date when LLC draws down the first amount of debt financing is defined as the “Draw Date”.
 
The first Financing Agreement Date occurred on November 29, 2015 when LLC and Masraf Al Rayan signed a Financing Agreement. A Draw Date pursuant to that Financing Agreement never occurred however because CCC (represented by CCIC executive management), after first agreeing in December 2015 to promptly (i) finalize the negotiation of the CCC-Oman construction contract (“CCC-Contract”) which in December 2015 was in an advanced stage of completion, (ii) sign the CCC-Contract, and (iii) invest their Deferred Cash Investments immediately after the CCC-Contract was signed – subsequently – and on several different occasions - changed its mind. Consequently, these matters have been the subject matter of numerous and virtually continuous discussions and negotiations since December 2015 with many and varied interim “agreed agreements”, all of which to date were “agreed” and then later forsaken by CCC. The CCC-Contract negotiations were ultimately abandoned by management (See: “The CCC-Contract”, below).
 
Further pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement as presently in effect:
 

1) | the liability for the Pre-Development Expense Amount shall be recorded on LLC’s financial records on the Draw Date and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), and 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | fifty percent (50%) of the Pre-Development Expense Amount will be paid to Omagine, Inc. on or within ten (10) days after the Draw Date, and 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Pre-Development Expense Amount will be paid to Omagine, Inc. in five equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the Draw Date. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Loans and Advances to LLC
 
The $11,697,342 of Loans and Advances (as of December 31, 2016) are payable to Omagine, Inc. by LLC on demand (but as a practical matter, not until LLC has the financial capacity to do so and Omagine has no present intention of demanding immediate payment of the Loans and Advances). 
 
The Success Fee 
 
The Shareholder Agreement defines the Success Fee as being equal to ten (10) million dollars. Pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement as presently in effect:

1) | the liability for the Success Fee shall be recorded on LLC’s financial records on the Draw Date and in accordance with the IFRS, and 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | the Success Fee will be paid to Omagine, Inc. in five annual two (2) million dollar installments beginning on or within ten (10) days after the Draw Date. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Omagine, may at its option, not enforce the aforementioned payment schedules for the Pre-Development Expense Amount and/or the Success Fee as agreed in the Shareholder Agreement and may agree to a different schedule for such payments and Omagine may likewise, at its option, refrain from demanding payment of the Loans and Advances until LLC is in a financial position to make such payment.
 
As of the date hereof, Omagine continues to make Loans and Advances to and on behalf of LLC for the activities being undertaken by or on behalf of LLC for the Omagine Project and expects to do so until the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement is agreed and signed. 
 
The Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement (assuming it is agreed and executed) is expected to, among other things, address, restate and formalize the terms of repayment by LLC to Omagine, Inc. of the Pre-Development Expense Amount, the Loans and Advances and the Success Fee but the manner, terms and conditions to be agreed relative thereto is uncertain at this time. Management’s primary goal continues to be the launch of serious design and construction activities for the Omagine Project and management does not object to any reasonable resolution of these and other matters preventing that goal from being accomplished.
 
LLC Capital Structure
 
As of the date hereof the LLC Shareholders have made:
 

(i) | cash investments totaling OR 360,000 [$936,000] (of which OR 300,000 [$780,000] was invested by Omagine), and 
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | a non-cash investment of the Land Rights valued at OR 276,666,667 ($718,614,000), for a total investment to date of OR 277,026,667 ($720,269,334). 

 
LLC is presently capitalized as follows:
 

Shareholder | Omani Rials | US Dollars | 
------------+----------------+------------+------------
Omagine | OR 300,000 | $ | 780,000 
RCA | OR 276,704,167 | $ | 718,711,500
CCC-Panama | OR 15,000 | $ | 39,000 
CCC-Oman | OR 7,500 | $ | 19,500 
Total | OR 77,026,667 | $ | 719,550,000


14
--

 

As of the date hereof, as a result of (i) Omagine having made its OR 210,000 ($560,000) Deferred Cash Investment into LLC, and (ii) RCA having made its OR 276,666,667 ($718,614,000) non-cash PIK Investment of the Land Rights into LLC, LLC is presently obligated to issue a further 2,100,000 LLC Shares to Omagine and a further 663,750 LLC Shares to RCA. As of the date hereof, neither CCC nor RCA have made their respective Deferred Cash Investments into LLC.
 
As of the date hereof, the ownership percentages of LLC as registered at Oman Ministry of Commerce & Industry are as follows:
 

LLC Shareholder | % Ownership | 
----------------+-----------------+----
Omagine | | 60 | %
RCA | | 25 | %
CCC-Panama | | 10 | %
CCC-Oman | | 5 | %
Total: | | 100 | %

 
On April 3, 2017 Omagine exercised its option to purchase all of the shares of LLC owned by CCC-Oman and CCC-Panama. RCA continues to be obligated to make further cash investments into LLC in the aggregate amount of OR 7,640,625 [$19,865,625] but the timing and payment of such RCA Deferred Cash Investment may change from that memorialized in the Shareholder Agreement presently in effect to what may be agreed in the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement.
 
The Transformation
 
At some time subsequent to the execution of the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement, LLC intends to transform its corporate structure from a limited liability company into a joint-stock company (the “Transformation”).
 
The Shareholder Agreement also specifies, among other things, the corporate governance and management policies of LLC and it provides for the LLC shares presently owned by JOL to be transferred to Omagine subsequent to the signing of the DA. We presently expect this share transfer to occur at the time of the Transformation of LLC into a joint stock company or at the time of the execution of the Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement.
 
The foregoing summary of the terms of the Shareholder Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Shareholder Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.6.
 
Banks, Investors and Contractors 
 
The Al Rayan Bank 
 
As previously reported, in November 2015, LLC signed an agreement (the “Al Rayan Loan Agreement”) and arranged a $25 million loan (the “Al Rayan Bank Loan”) with Masraf Al Rayan, a substantial Qatari bank. The Al Rayan Loan Agreement and the Al Rayan Bank Loan will not be utilized by LLC due to CCC’s failure to make its required Deferred Investment into LLC. 
 
The Omani Bank with whom CCC has a business relationship
 
Extended meetings and discussions with CCC and with the Omani Bank with whom CCC has a business relationship resulted in changing, confusing and often contradictory paths being followed before ending unsuccessfully. It was planned by all the LLC Shareholders that CCC and RCA would inject into LLC a portion (an aggregate of approximately $26 million USD) of their “Deferred Equity Investments” (as such term is defined in the Shareholder Agreement); that LLC would hire the Omani Bank as its financial adviser and lender; that LLC would execute a Phase One valued at approximately $220 million and consisting of one hotel, 250 residences and one Pearl; that LLC and CCC-Oman would enter into the CCC-Contract; and that an Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement would be executed, however all such plans were apparently based on CCC providing the adequate corporate guarantee to the Omani bank – which to the best of management’s knowledge – did not happen. Discussions with the Omani bank and with CCC on this matter are now ended. 
 

15

Management however remains optimistic that its ongoing discussions with an alternative bank can be concluded when and if our new investor to replace CCC becomes an LLC shareholder.
 
Other Investors and Contractors
 
During 2015 and 2016 management has conducted a multitude of investor presentations across the MENA Region with potential LLC equity investors including sovereign funds, investment funds and high net-worth individuals. Several of these investors expressed interest in becoming shareholders of LLC but in all such cases to date except one, management concluded that the percentage of LLC equity required by such investors was excessive and much too dilutive to the LLC Shareholders (and indirectly dilutive to our Omagine shareholders via their 60% ownership of LLC). LLC management is presently focused on the estate of the abovementioned investor with whom it has a written Investment Agreement) and on two European investment funds as back-up investors in the event such is needed.
 
Given the present liquidity issues at local banks, the matter of construction debt financing (“Project Finance”) is an issue at the top of all developer’s and contractor’s agendas. The required Project Finance for the Omagine Project – or any project – is not really needed until after the masterplanning and design phase is complete or near complete.
 
Design, Development & Construction:
 
The design, development and construction of the Omagine Project will be divided into various phases (each, a “Phase”). Since the CCC Contract has not and will not be signed, neither CCC nor any other contractor is presently expected to be the General Contractor for the entire Omagine Project. The various construction Phases are now expected to be put out to bid to various contractors and this competitive bidding process (especially given the present economic environment for contractors in the MENA Region) is expected to garner substantial cost savings for LLC.
Initial Activities
 
The Immediate Post-DA Period is the time period between the DA signing and the first Financing Agreement Date. The execution of many initial activities during this period by LLC required the parallel launching by LLC management of many diverse efforts and processes on multiple fronts immediately after the DA Execution Date of October 2, 2014 and continuing through the date hereof. This early initiative fast track strategy (financed entirely by Omagine) greatly benefited LLC to date in many ways, among which are:

1. | the DA was Ratified by the Government; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | the UA was signed and registered with the Government; 
3. | the Operative Date of July 1, 2015 replaced both the Execution Date of October 2, 2014 and the Effective Date of March 11, 2015 referenced in the DA;

4. | three separate valuation studies and reports were commissioned and the valuation of the Land Rights was completed; 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. | expert accounting analyses and reports were received from PwC, Deloitte and the Company’s independent auditor regarding LLC’s purchase of the Land Rights and the recording thereof in LLC’s and the Company’s financial statements; 
6. | LLC booked 276,666,667 Omani Rials of new equity which is also reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements; 
7. | a cost accounting budgetary framework to be used during the development, construction and marketing of the Omagine Project was created by an independent accounting and finance consultant; 
8. | an expert IT consultant was selected to architect and install the IT framework and solutions we intend to implement across LLC and the Company and across the Omagine Project’s “smart city” environment; 
9. | an independent third party update to our feasibility study was commissioned and completed; 
10. | an update of LLC’s internal financial model by specialist real estate investment bankers and advisers was commissioned and completed; 
11. | confirmation from banks in Oman (but not from banks outside of Oman) that the value of the Land Rights can be used as collateral to support the Syndicated Bank Financing was received; 
12. | the “Brand Identity” and associated brand pillar components and uniform brand messaging platform we intend to implement for Omagine, LLC and the Omagine Project were created; 
13. | LLC’s strategic plan was completed; 
14. | multiple meetings with, and multiple iterations of proposals and presentations from major mission-critical project consultants (architects, designers, master planners, engineers, program managers, quantity surveyors, real estate advisers, hospitality advisers, hotel management companies, financial advisers and others) have been received, reviewed and analyzed by management and selections of many consultants have been made by management; 
15. | candidates for senior LLC executive positions have been recruited, interviewed and selected; 
16. | extensive and multiple presentations and meetings with potential LLC equity investors in six MENA Region countries, Europe, Asia and the U.S. were conducted and while most offers were declined by LLC, negotiations with several selected strategic investors are still ongoing with a present focus on one such investor; 
17. | extensive and multiple presentations and meetings with local, regional and international banks in Oman, the MENA Region and Europe with respect to the provision of Syndicated Bank Financing have occurred with a present focus on one such bank; 
18. | Multiple drafts of the CCC Contract were created (most recently in May 2016) but the final attempt to close this transaction ended unsuccessfully after many delays, and 
19. | several other contracts for mission-critical consultants are presently being prepared,

The CCC Contract / The CCC Phases
 
In August 2016, management was optimistic and positively inclined to believe that a beneficial conclusion for all parties concerned would be forthcoming in a matter of several weeks but no conclusion occurred and management concluded that no amount of further negotiations would result in a definitive conclusion of these matters with CCC.
 
All prior disclosures and discussion of the CCC-Contract and to prior descriptions of Phase One or other phases contemplated under the CCC-Contract are now inoperative, void and of no consequence since the CCC-Contract was not and will not be signed with CCC-Oman. The Omagine Project will however still be developed in Phases but the previously described and disclosed description of phases will be altered as we go forward. Discussions with CCC have ceased and Omagine exercised its option to purchase all of the shares of LLC owned by CCC-Oman and CCC-Panama.
 
It is presently expected that several building contractors will be involved in the project as the various Phases of the work is designed and specified and then put out to bid by local contractors after the design is substantially completed. As part of the masterplanning, we will develop a phasing program for the entire project and as the design and/or specifications of any Phase is sufficiently completed such that LLC can tender it for competitive bidding it will do so. CCC-Oman will be welcome to bid on any such Phase if it so desires.
 
Any new construction contracts with potential contractors will be modeled after the early draft CCC-Contract as envisioned by Omagine and will be based on internationally accepted contracting standards promulgated by the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (“FIDIC”) and will contain a set of industry standard performance parameters, incentives and penalties to ensure Omagine LLC’s interests are protected and that value is delivered.
 
LLC will manage the bidding and competitive process by which the various contractors will be chosen. There is an ample supply of qualified contractors in Oman and the MENA region.
 
The contractor will only commence construction activities on a Phase or section of a Phase after the competitive bids therefore are examined and a contract award is made by LLC.
 
It is anticipated that several Phases will be under construction simultaneously in an overlapping manner as the various designs and specifications for the various Phases are sequentially completed. Construction on Phases will continue until the conclusion of all Permanent Works constituting the Omagine Project are completed.
 
LLC plans to maintain a robust control of the design of the entire project and of each Phase through to completion.
 
Development Phases / Construction Phases / Project Financing / Masterplanning

It is anticipated that the Omagine Project will be developed in several phases and each such phase will likely include one or more Sections of construction. It is expected therefore that several tranches of project financing from banks or other financial institutions will occur and several Financing Agreements will likely be executed during the course of the project’s phased development and construction. The first Financing Agreement Date occurred on November 29, 2015 with the signing of the Al Rayan Loan agreement but as stated above it was never utilized. Until other Financing Agreements are actually executed by the relevant parties however, no assurance can be given that they actually will be so executed or that Project Financing will be available to LLC. Each such further Financing Agreement, if any, is expected to coincide approximately with the beginning of a new development and construction phase, all of which phases will include design, marketing and one or more new Sections of construction activities. The closing of a tranche of Project Finance whether from banks, investors, financial institutions or from Syndicated Bank Financing will each be memorialized by a separate Financing Agreement. 

18
--

 

The November 29, 2015 execution date of the first such Financing Agreement with Masraf Al Rayan is defined in the Shareholder Agreement as the “Financing Agreement Date”. The earlier that the Financing Agreement Date occurred, the better it was expected to be for LLC, the Omagine Project, and all concerned for a variety of reasons but this was ultimately complicated by the CCC-Contract delays described herein. The present liquidity squeeze in GCC banks may continue to have a negative impact on our Project Finance efforts. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the bank with which we are presently negotiating a project finance package does not have such liquidity issues. 
 
No assurance however can be given at this time as to whether the Company will be successful in arranging either Equity Sales or Debt Facilities or in closing the financing facility for the Omagine Project until such events actually happen.
 
Any reference in this report to a term or condition of the Development Agreement, the Usufruct Agreement and/or the Shareholders Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full texts of such agreements. The full text of the Development Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibits 10.7 and 99.1. The full text of the Usufruct Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibits 10.8 and 99.2. The full text of the Shareholder Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.6.
 
The masterplanning of the Omagine Project will not begin until a new investor to replace CCC is secured and an Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement is signed. No further feasibility study is presently required or planned for the project as our financial model adequately demonstrates the project’s financial feasibility. It is presently planned that in parallel with the masterplanning effort we will engage the hospitality, real estate, insurance and marketing consultants to execute various professional studies which will inform the masterplanning process and our business plan. These consultants and advisers all contribute to and inform the masterplanning and final design process for the Omagine Project.
 
The preliminary master plan along with the various studies and our fleshed-out business plan (which in turn is informed by our now completed Strategic Plan) is expected to be utilized by the financial adviser to drive the Syndicated Bank Financing effort.
 
During the masterplanning process, exact sizes, shapes and placement of the various project elements (residential, hotels, entertainment, landscape, etc.) are determined and as the master plan evolves and takes shape, the various follow-on Phases of development and construction will also naturally evolve. Simultaneously with these processes, the Financial Adviser will be updating the Omagine Project’s financial model to reflect the precise and final constituent project elements along with their projected costs and associated projected revenue streams. Finally, all of the foregoing data and other marketing, sales and strategic planning studies created by or on behalf of LLC are assembled into an “LLC Business Plan”. With the LLC Business Plan in hand and with the LLC Financial Adviser in the lead, LLC and the Financial Adviser and other select consultants set about the business of making final presentations to the various banks, with which we are now and will continue to be in touch, with the objective of arranging the Syndicated Bank Financing.
 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this report regarding possible, proposed or planned (i) sales of equity by Omagine and/or LLC (“Equity Sales”), or (ii) debt facilities with banks, financial institutions or other persons or sale of debt securities by LLC (collectively, “Debt Facilities”), or (iii) Syndicated Bank Financing or Project Finance, no assurance can be given at this time as to whether the Company or LLC will be able to obtain the significant amount of financing and Project Finance necessary over time to execute the development of the Omagine Project.
 
Over the past many months, we have conducted, and continue to conduct, numerous meetings:
 

i. | with respect to LLC Equity Sales, with several potential equity investors interested in becoming shareholders of LLC, including sovereign funds, investment funds and high net-worth individuals from Europe, China, and several MENA Region countries, and 
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. | with respect to Omagine Equity Sales, with investment funds and high net-worth investors in the U.S., Europe and the MENA Region interested in becoming shareholders of Omagine, and 
iii. | with respect to Debt Facilities for LLC other than Syndicated Bank Financing, with several banks and other potential investors in the U.S., Europe, the GCC countries and Oman, and 


19
--


iv. | with respect to major local, regional and international banks in Oman and the GCC there appeared to be a significant amount of banking liquidity in 2015, but presently the banking liquidity levels are modestly rebounding after being under severe pressure in 2016 primarily as a result of the worldwide drop in the price of crude oil and resulting decrease in deposits into these banks by governments. The large appetite we witnessed in 2015 at such banks for providing Syndicated Bank Financing and Debt Facilities to LLC cooled in 2016 but appear to be easing in 2017. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the bank with which we are presently negotiating a project finance package does not have such liquidity issues. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
LLC management and financial executives have held numerous meetings and discussions over the past numerous months with many major local and international banks, the purpose of which, among other things, was to discuss the prospects for such banks providing the Syndicated Bank Financing which is expected to be composed primarily of debt financing from banks. This is a crucial matter to address and accomplish in order to make the Omagine Project a reality. Based on present assumptions, we estimate that LLC’s peak Syndicated Bank Financing requirements will be approximately $350 to $400 million during the multi-year development cycle of the Omagine Project.
 
The process of obtaining project financing is not a trivial exercise. It is a time-consuming and complicated process which, when successful, culminates in an event known as a “Financial Close” – usually several Financial Close events - as projects of the size and scope of the Omagine Project are almost always developed in phases. With respect to any proposed Syndicated Bank Financing requirements, the question of whether or not LLC’s Land Rights can or will be used by the various banks as collateral to support such Syndicated Bank Financing is therefore of considerable importance. At present LLC management is confident that banks within Oman will use LLC’s Land Rights as collateral for bank debt facilities for LLC but we are unclear as to the position of many of the regional and international banks outside of Oman in this regard.
 
The DA addresses this matter in considerable length and clearly contemplates that LLC - as the registered owner of the Land Rights will be granting a security interest in its Land Rights to banks and lenders to the project. The DA further obliges the Government - as the registered owner of the land - to consent to any such grant of a security interest by LLC. (See: Exhibits 10.7 and 99.1, and Clause 22 of the DA - Lenders Security Interests). The DA states in relevant part:
 
“… the Government shall enter into Direct Agreements with Lenders acknowledging their rights by way of Security Interests over certain assets of the Project Company including an assignment to the Lenders of the Development Agreement, the Usufruct Agreement, other related agreements, and the Project Assets …” (See: Exhibits 10.7 and 99.1, Schedule 20 to the DA - Principles of Direct Agreement).
 
The major Omani banks with which LLC management has met - and with whom we continue to meet and update - have indicated that LLC’s Land Rights will be considered by such Omani banks as collateral to support bank financing debt facilities for the Project Finance for the Omagine Project but other non-Omani regional and international banks (including their branches in Oman) have been less forthcoming with definitive answers until they see more details about the nature and extent of LLC’s Land Rights. 
 
LLC management is presently confident that the OR 276,666,667 ($718,614,000) value of its Land Rights will be considered by the Omani banks as collateral for the Syndicated Bank Financing for the Omagine Project but it remains unclear at this stage whether or not banks other than Omani banks will do likewise. Notwithstanding the foregoing statement however, it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty what future events may alter LLC’s present assessment of its ability to use its Land Rights to collateralize any bank debt financing including any Syndicated Bank Financing.
 
Updated Studies
 
In addition to the valuation studies and reports with respect to the Land Rights (See: “The Land Rights”, above), management also commissioned:
 

20
--


(i) | an updated feasibility study of the Omagine Project by an independent third party which is a professional real estate, tourism and marketing consultant, and 
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | an updated LLC internal financial model for the Omagine Project by unaffiliated third parties who are expert financial, investment banking and real estate consultants. 

 
Both the updated feasibility study and the financial model have been completed and they will be utilized by LLC to fine tune its development plans, and ultimately by LLC’s designated Financial Adviser for the balance of the project in arranging the Syndicated Bank Financing and other financing for LLC as may be required.
 
Omagine LLC’s internal financial model is updated, modified and adjusted from time to time in order to capture what management believes are the then present market realities and projected trends. The financial model is organized to show best case, worst case and probable case scenarios. The most recently updated probable case scenario forecasts substantial net positive cash flows for Omagine LLC over the seven year period subsequent to the signing of the DA and a net present value (“NPV”) of the Omagine Project of approximately $1.4 billion dollars. Management believes its financial model assumptions are reasonable but cautions that they may change as new facts and information become available, as the development program and design process unfolds and as market conditions require. It is virtually certain that the various components of the financial model - and therefore the estimates of total cash flow and NPV - will change from time to time in line with market fluctuations and as the project unfolds.
 
The sale of residential and commercial properties is a large revenue driver supporting Omagine LLC’s internal financial projections. The OR 276,666,667 average valuation of the Land Rights has had a positive effect on projected revenue at LLC.
 
Management cautions that investors should not place undue reliance on the aforementioned financial model projections or on estimates by market participants mentioned herein as all such projections, estimates and forecasts are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, and no assurance can be given that the projections will be realized or that the estimates or forecasts will prove to be accurate. Potential investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statement or forecast, which, unless otherwise noted to the contrary, speaks only as of the date hereof.
 
Off Plan Sales and Land Price Payments
 
As is present practice in Oman, LLC anticipates that sales contracts with third party purchasers of residential or commercial properties that are purchased “off plan” (i.e. purchased before the construction thereof), will stipulate the payment to LLC by such purchasers of (i) a deposit on signing of such sales contract, and (ii) progress payments during the construction period of the relevant property covered by such sales contract. Since the aggregate of such deposit and progress payments before and during the construction of the relevant property is expected to be approximately 85% of the sales price of the relevant property stipulated in such sales contract, LLC anticipates that (i) the construction costs for properties that are sold “off plan” will be substantially “owner-financed” by the relevant purchaser, and (ii) it will likely be unnecessary therefore for LLC to utilize any or very much Syndicated Bank Financing in order to pay for the construction costs of properties which are sold pursuant to “off plan” sales contracts. Management expects that this commonly accepted sales contract and payment process will significantly benefit LLC by reducing its aggregate requirements for Syndicated Bank Financing from its banks. The consumer appetite for such “off plan” sales is less today than it was in recent years. (See “Market Conditions” below).
 
Furthermore, Land Price Payments to the Government are not due or owing from LLC until such time as LLC legally transfers the freehold title to land to a purchaser at the time of the closing of the sale of such land. Such closings will only occur after LLC has received final payment of the relevant sales contract amount from the purchaser. LLC’s financing profile is therefore further enhanced since it is not obligated to make any Land Price Payments to the Government until after it has already received 100% of the contracted sales price amount from the relevant purchaser at the closing when the freehold title to such land and property is transferred to the purchaser.

Consolidated Results
 
The financial results of LLC are included in the consolidated financial results of the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company experienced a substantial increase in capital on July 2, 2015 when the Land Rights were registered in LLC’s name and later recorded in LLC’s and the Company’s financial statements. The Company will experience another substantial increase in capital, if and when further capital increases from RCA and a new investor occur at LLC and the then appropriate percentage representing Omagine’s ownership interest in LLC is recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. LLC’s ongoing financial results will be included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as appropriate for as long as Omagine remains a shareholder of LLC.
 
In addition to the activities mentioned above, the Company’s preparations for its future business activities also include, but are not limited to: (i) negotiating various agreements with other major vendors, contractors, consultants and employees proposed to be involved in the Omagine Project, (ii) arranging the appropriate and required legal, accounting, tax and other professional services both in Oman and the U.S., (iii) reviewing and complying (to the extent we are presently able) with the listing requirements of various stock exchanges so we may be prepared to apply for such listing(s) as soon as we are eligible, (iv) examining various other matters we believe will enhance shareholder value, and (v) examining other potential Company revenue streams which are ancillary to, and derivative of, the Omagine Project.
 
The Company plans to enter businesses other than real estate development - and ancillary to, and derivative of, the Omagine Project - and the Company presently expects to generate ongoing revenue streams from such businesses, but no projections of the amount of such revenue, if any, can be made at this time.
 
Although the Company had expected to generate revenue in the medium term as LLC (i) began reimbursing Omagine for its Pre-Development Expenses, and (ii) begins paying the Success Fee installments to Omagine, such reimbursements are now likely to be delayed and/or possibly altered by the terms of an Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement (See: “Pre-Development Expenses and Loans and Advances to LLC” and “Success Fee” above). The Company is not expected to generate revenue from sales or operations of properties within the Omagine Project until the development and construction of the Omagine Project is substantially underway. The masterplanning, development and construction of the Omagine Project is not expected to begin in earnest until the matter of a replacement investor for CCC is settled.
 
Financial Adviser
 
LLC’s financial adviser (“Financial Adviser”) for the Omagine Project is expected to be a bank or other professional financial consulting company. As such the Financial Adviser will arrange the syndication among several banks of the debt financing (“Syndicated Bank Financing”) for the Omagine Project.
 
We are presently in discussions with a bank which has already given LLC a “soft commitment” with respect to the provision by it of the debt financing required for the Omagine Project.
 
Importantly, given the present liquidity issues at local and MENA Region banks, the matter of Project Finance is an issue that has now moved to the forefront of LLC’s agenda. While the required Project Finance for the Omagine Project (estimated at approximately $400 million) – or any project – is not usually needed until after the masterplanning and design phase is complete or near complete, given present economic strains both developers and contractors are well advised to seek to lock up a Project Finance commitment early on rather than waiting to start a syndication at a later date.
 
LLC’s Financial Adviser will advise on capital structure and lead the arrangement and placement of the Syndicated Bank Financing. LLC will then work together with its Financial Advisor to appoint lead arrangers for such Syndicated Bank Financing which may include the Financial Advisor itself.
 
The amount of Syndicated Bank Financing owed at any one time by LLC to its Lenders is expected to fluctuate over the development and construction cycle of the Omagine Project and will be greatly influenced by (i) any additional Equity Sales, and (ii) the pace and tempo of LLC’s receipt of proceeds from its planned sales of real estate to third parties. The capital of LLC, proceeds from Equity Sales if any, Syndicated Bank Financing and the proceeds from sales of its residential and commercial properties, are expected to be utilized by LLC to develop the Omagine Project.

The maximum amount of such Syndicated Bank Financing presently expected to be outstanding at any one time during the development and construction cycle of the Omagine Project is presently estimated by management to be between $350 million and $400 million.
 
We have had extensive discussions with a number of MENA Region financial institutions with respect to such Syndicated Bank Financing and while they remain interested in discussing the Project Finance for the Omagine Project, almost all such banks confirmed the tightening of bank liquidity due to the current economic climate resulting from the sharply reduced price for crude oil. We are presently in discussions with a bank which is not experiencing such liquidity issues and which has already given LLC a “soft commitment” with respect to the provision by it of the debt financing required for the Omagine Project. With LLC’s Financial Adviser leading this effort, management remains hopeful with respect to LLC’s prospects for arranging the Syndicated Bank Financing for the Omagine Project but recognizes that given present economic and market conditions, it is not a trivial task and will be challenging. These discussions are ongoing and no assurances can be given at this time regarding the outcome, if any, from such discussions. The DA recognizes and addresses this issue when it states, in relevant part:
 
“The Government recognizes that the Project Company intends to raise limited recourse financing in relation to the Project and that Lenders may expect to be afforded certain rights in relation to it. Accordingly, the Project Company will by or before the completion of twelve (12) months from the Execution Date [now the Operative Date of July 1, 2015; see Exhibits 10.7, 99.1, 10.8 and 99.2] enter into a written term sheet with the Lenders for the financing of the First Phase, any other phase or all of the Project (a “Term Sheet”). If the Project Company has not delivered a copy of such Term Sheet to the Government by or before the expiry of the twelve (12) month period referred to above, this Development Agreement then shall have no further effect.” (See Exhibits 10.7 and 99.1).
 
The condition referred to above was fulfilled on November 9, 2015 when LLC entered into a written term sheet with Masraf Al Rayan with respect to the financing of the then planned first phase of the Omagine Project. Unfortunately due to CCC’s failure to fulfil its investment obligations under the Shareholder Agreement such financing was never utilized.
 
MENA Region banks and financial institutions continue to maintain adequate levels of liquidity but the rapid fall in world oil prices is a challenge to those banks whose liquidity relies to a great deal on government deposits resulting from the sale of crude oil. Such new and large government borrowings from commercial banking institutions tend to crowd out commercial borrowing capacity for private companies. The largest banks of course are weathering this storm more handily then the mid-size or smaller banks.
 
The project financing environment in Oman and the MENA Region continues to remain cautious after the rapid decline of worldwide oil prices which led to the rapid decline of bank deposits being received from governments. LLC management regularly meets with several internationally recognized Financial Advisers, all of whom have deep and wide-ranging expertise in the MENA Region project financing markets and as part of their normal business activities are in regular contact with MENA Region banks and international financial institutions regarding the status of and conditions prevailing in the project finance marketplace. The Company is now cautiously optimistic (but less confident then it had been before the 2015 sudden drop in oil prices) that LLC and its yet to be designated Financial Adviser will be able to arrange the necessary project financing for the Omagine Project. Management believes that all the Financial Advisers and banks with whom it has recently met concur that there is currently still a reasonable degree of liquidity and appetite among MENA Region banks and financial institutions for lending to, and investing in, sound development projects in the MENA Region. Most such persons and institutions however are more cautious than they were over a year ago because of the recent rapid fall in oil prices and the continuation of the unsettled military activities ongoing in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya.
 
Notwithstanding the fact that LLC has already received a “soft commitment” with respect to the provision of the debt financing required for the Omagine Project from a bank without the aforementioned liquidity issues, no assurance can be given at this time that LLC will be able to obtain any, or a sufficient amount of, the project financing required to develop, build and complete the Omagine Project. If such a circumstance were to occur, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.

Market Conditions
 
As previously disclosed and as has been and continues to be widely reported by local and international media and press, the worldwide price of crude oil fell very suddenly and dramatically in 2014 and 2015 (from over $100 per barrel to about $25/$30 per barrel) as robust production in the U.S. and elsewhere created a global glut of crude oil. Presently the price of crude oil is about $45/bbl. Almost all countries in the MENA Region are dependent on the sale of crude oil to support their economies and their government spending programs. 
 
Although MENA Region governments had 100s of billions of dollars of savings in sovereign reserve funds, this oil price shock ushered in an extremely challenging environment for the MENA Region governments and for the companies of all types – including developers and contractors – operating in the MENA region. In reaction to the large, rapid and unexpected drop in crude oil prices, government budgets were slashed across the region; contractors’ payments were delayed; and many government sponsored projects were postponed, delayed or cancelled. Payment delays and stalled government projects off the back of the decline in oil prices have severely impacted the entire construction industry in the MENA Region – including in Oman. The Omagine Project however is not a government sponsored project and Omagine LLC is a private company.
 
Crude oil prices “seem” to have recently stabilized around the mid-$40s per barrel price and a rebalancing of the market “seems to be” is in progress but the knock-on effects of the lower government spending and the delayed payments by MENA Region governments to contractors has had a severe economic impact on local economies and contractors.
 
Almost all local banking institutions in the MENA Region are dependent on large deposits from oil and gas sales by governments in order to provide the normally excess liquidity apparent in the local banking system prior to this recent dramatic worldwide drop in oil prices. With the sudden fall in deposits from oil sales, bank liquidity at local banking institutions in the GCC and wider MENA Region were under immense pressure as deposits fell dramatically while simultaneously governments became large borrowers where they were not before. Even now some of the largest contractors are experiencing difficulties.
 
We expect that this sudden business cycle change will eventually right itself as all market participants adapt to the new realities but we are of the present opinion, provided our Investment Agreement with our proposed new investor or with one of the European funds with which we are presently in discussions results in the closing of an investment transaction to replace CCC, that the Company will succeed in creatively making a path where none had apparently previously existed. Because of the significant delays in developing the Omagine Project to date however, tensions are high both in the local market and the Government and no assurance can presently be given that our present plans will succeed. Also, should the current negative economic conditions caused by the GCC-wide liquidity squeeze at banks continue unabated, a knock-on effect in the real estate markets resulting in slower or fewer sales and lower selling prices could occur.
 
The market intelligence garnered by management indicates that local bankers and market participants believe that both transaction volume and pricing in the Omani real estate market are stable and are expected to improve during 2017 relative to expected performance in 2015 and 2016. We are presently unsure what the impact on transaction volume and pricing will be from the fall in crude oil prices but we expect some softness in the market as all participants adjust to the “new normal” of $40 to $50 crude oil prices. From a timing perspective, LLC plans to now launch residential and commercial sales at the Omagine Project within the first 12 months after we close an investment transaction to replace CCC’s now defaulted investment.
 
Trends in the Omani market during the past few years have indicated a reduced presence of speculative buyers and a reduced consumer appetite for pre-sales of residence units (“off-plan” sales) as buyers now frequently demand a finished product before entering into sales contracts with developers. Although, many societal disorders, military activities and terrorism continue in other parts of the MENA Region, as long as the politically stable and quite safe conditions existing at present in Oman persist then, market conditions should favorably impact LLC’s future operations.
 
Nearby Dubai is experiencing softness in its residential sales and leasing market but in general Dubai’s economy (a regional barometer) remains relatively strong and, in certain areas, quite robust. Raw material and labor prices remain somewhat volatile in Oman having recently experienced both downward and upward swings over the past year – but overall construction costs are sharply down due to the severe competition presently in the market among building contractors.

In Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya, among other countries, daily violent military clashes and terrorism are now commonplace. Other Arab countries in the MENA Region have experienced and are experiencing demonstrations of discontent with the rule of their heads of state and in some cases these demonstrations are being met with violent pushback by some MENA Region governments but this was not and is not the case in politically and economically stable Oman. Anxiety over the health of His Majesty, the much beloved Sultan Qaboos, and what effect, if any, that will have on Oman’s political stability and leadership succession seems to have abated and His Majesty seen to be actively managing state affairs.
 
Construction material costs and property selling prices in Oman and the surrounding region remain somewhat volatile and undue reliance on present forecasts should be avoided. Management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Management fully expects that its cost estimates for the Omagine Project (and therefore, its financial model) will require adjustment – possibly significant adjustment – as future events unfold. Investors and shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statement or forecast, which speaks only as of the date hereof.
 
Nearby Dubai leads the way for the Gulf tourism market and this is likely to be the case for the foreseeable future, given its existing visitor market, attractions, its impressive future capital development and marketing investment programs, and especially given its recent selection as the host for EXPO 2020 which is expected to attract over 25 million visitors.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
After it closes an investment transaction to replace CCC as an investor and shareholder, LLC plans to undertake several wide ranging and continuous marketing, advertising, branding and public relations campaigns to establish its brand identity prior to LLC’s launch of residential and commercial properties for sale and to advertise and promote its forthcoming entertainment, hospitality and retail offerings.
 
As we move forward we plan to construct and operate a sales showroom at the Omagine Site. The sales office/showroom will be staffed with experienced real estate sales personnel and will contain large scale models of the Omagine Project and its various components as well as associated collateral sales and marketing materials.
 
The anticipated launch date for residential and commercial sales was previously planned to be in the first or second quarter of 2018 but the unexpected death of our proposed new investor in LLC has now delayed this launch date further and it is now contingent on closing the aforementioned investment transaction. Management expects that the continuing stability of local real estate markets as well as the Government’s continuing improvements to Oman’s infrastructure (Muscat International Airport, roads, regional airports, etc.) will contribute positively to LLC’s future sales prospects. The impact of the recent fall in crude oil prices and the knock-on economic effects on consumers and government projects is unknown and difficult to predict at this time.
 
Management expects the Omagine Project to benefit from Dubai’s hosting of EXPO 2020, and similarly from nearby Qatar’s hosting of the World Cup Games in 2022. Both of these events are expected to attract a huge amount of visitors and tourists. The Omagine Project will be conveniently located one hour from Dubai and Qatar by air and is easily accessible by a fine roadway system in both Oman and the U.A.E. A visit to the Omagine Project will be a natural and logical addition to a Dubai or Qatar visit.
 
Sale prices and rental rates for housing in other integrated tourism projects in the Muscat area of Oman have remained relatively stable during 2016 and as of the date of this report. The inventory of unsold housing in the secondary (re-sale) market (both outside of and within ITCs) has diminished due to recent, albeit quite price-sensitive, sales activity. New housing inventory, especially smaller apartments designed to hit perceived market price-points, has continued to come onto the local Muscat area market and the market absorption rates (number of market transactions) for such new residential housing is strong. The DA allows for sales and pre-sales of any of the residential or commercial buildings that will be developed and built on the Omagine Site.
 
The DA stipulates the obligation of the Government to issue such Licenses and Permits as may be required for the development of the Omagine Project, including but not limited to issuing an Integrated Tourism Complex License (“ITC License”) designating the Omagine Project as an ITC. On June 26, 2014, the Government issued an ITC License to LLC designating the Omagine Project as an ITC.

Non-Omani persons (including expatriates living and working in Oman) are forbidden by Omani law to purchase land, residences or commercial properties in Oman unless such land, residences or commercial properties are located within an ITC. Because it is now licensed as an ITC, the land, residences and commercial properties within the Omagine Project may be sold to any buyer worldwide - including any non-Omani buyer - and the freehold title to such land, residences and commercial properties may be transferred to such buyers. Residences in ITCs are viewed to be highly desirable by purchasers (by both investors and owner-occupiers) and ITC residences therefore enjoy a premium selling price relative to non-ITC residences. Purchasers of residences within Omagine (or any ITC) are entitled by Omani Law to be issued a resident visa (for themselves and their immediate family).
 
The excellent location of the Omagine Site is recognized by local market participants and the significance of the provision of the Omagine Site to LLC is substantial. The increase in the value over the last several years of the land constituting the Omagine Site has had a positive effect on the valuation of the Land Rights and is expected to have a positive effect on LLC’s revenue from the sale of residential and commercial properties. The value of the land constituting the Omagine Site is expected to be a primary driver of future LLC and Company revenue and the benefits accruing to LLC and the Company pursuant to LLC’s Land Rights over the Project Land is expected to be material and significant.
 
Pursuant to the DA and UA, LLC will pay the Government OR 25 ($65) per square meter for the Project Land it sells to third party purchasers. The average valuation for the Land Rights (net of such Land Price) is OR 276,666,667 ($718,614,000) (See: “The Land Rights”, above).
 
Design, Engineering, Construction, Program Management, Content Development
 
The Company does not presently own or directly operate any design, engineering, content development or construction companies or facilities. With assistance from Omagine via the Loans and Advances, LLC has undertaken many critical tasks as indicated above, but for LLC to fully accomplish its objectives and undertake and finance the Omagine Project, it will have to close an Equity Sale transaction and execute an Amended and Restated Shareholder Agreement. The failure to date to accomplish these matters with CCC has delayed the Omagine Project and the masterplanning process.
 
Subject to the approval of its shareholders and to negotiating and agreeing to a contract, LLC intends to hire a design firm, an engineering firm, a program management firm, a construction management firm and a quantity surveying/cost consultant firm.
 
The interpretive design, entertainment content, and visitor experience design candidates to be hired by LLC have been narrowed to a short list of professional companies. One or more of such companies (“Content Developers”) will be engaged by LLC to design the transformation of Omagine’s high level strategic vision for the content of the Pearl structures and surrounding areas into physical places offering emotional, intellectual and physical experiences and interactions. Each of the prospective Content Developers has serviced a diverse client base, including theme parks, museums, zoos, aquariums and other such complex entertainment centers around the world, including in the MENA Region, and each continues to regularly produce world class attractions globally of the size and scope of the Omagine Project.
 
LLC presently intends to hire various local Omani contractors for the construction of the Omagine Project. 
 
To date, Omagine has generally conceived the development concepts and defined the “scope of work” and then, as required, contracted with various designers, architects, contractors and consultants in the United States, Europe and the Middle East to perform those tasks. LLC will engage various firms as its consultants (master planner, engineers, real estate and hospitality consultants, etc.) who will together with management finalize the design for the entire Omagine Project. There are many such consultants available with competitive pricing and the Company does not believe that the loss or inability to perform of any such consultant which it has selected would have a material, adverse impact on its business or operations. The Company believes it maintains a good working business relationship with its consultants. As presently planned, all copyrights to all material documents, designs and drawings executed by such independent designers, architects, contractors and consultants are, or will be, the property of either LLC or Omagine.

Competition
 
The real-estate development business in Oman is a competitive business populated by companies with substantially greater financial, managerial and personnel resources than LLC presently possesses. Management believes that Omagine’s ability to attract RCA as a strategic shareholder for LLC and to assemble and coordinate a team of experienced American, European and Middle Eastern consultants in a wide variety of specialized fields was crucial to its advancing the Omagine Project to its present status. Each of these consultants, several of whom will become employees of Omagine and/or LLC, are highly experienced in their respective fields. These fields of expertise include the following: strategic planning; visioning; branding; marketing; Islamic scholarship and research; master planning; architecture; city planning; conceptual design; project management; construction management; general contracting; quantity surveying and costing; interior design; landscape design; art; public policy; engineering (structural, civil, mechanical, electrical, marine); Omani law; cultural and exhibition design; interpretative design; tourism; visitor experience design; recreational operations planning and management; investment banking; structured finance; motion based ride technology; film technology; and training and hotel management.
 
Management has identified several key personnel whom we plan to appoint to executive positions with Omagine LLC in Oman subsequent to the closing of suitable financial arrangements for Omagine LLC. Frank Drohan, who is Omagine’s president and the Managing Director of LLC, has over 30 years of experience doing business across most of the MENA Region and is familiar with the cultural and business environment of the MENA Region. In addition, Mr. Sam Hamdan, who is Omagine’s primary strategic consultant and the Deputy Managing Director of LLC has over 25 years of experience in the MENA Region. Mr. Hamdan is fluent in Arabic and English. Both Mr. Drohan and Mr. Hamdan reside in Oman and Dubai respectively and are leading and directing the Company’s ongoing negotiations in Oman with investors and the Government.
 
Although several of LLC’s competitors have well established businesses and brand reputations, management believes that LLC’s advantages are (i) the DA has been signed by LLC and signed and ratified by the Government of Oman, (ii) the uniqueness of the Omagine Project is particularly attractive to the Government, (iii) Omagine’s and LLC’s senior management have established strong and trusting relationships with the relevant Government officials and with LLC’s partner RCA, (iv) LLC’s intention to engage world class architects, designers, real estate advisers and Financial Advisers; and (v) the Shareholder Agreement, which strongly demonstrates the serious investors and professionals that have been recruited to assist in the development of the Omagine Project (although the default by CCC and present economic conditions in the MENA Region cut against this advantage). Company management believes LLC can successfully compete in this marketplace through a combination of unique development concepts, the recruitment of experienced and capable executive management for Omagine LLC in Oman, effective relationship management, highly experienced and well-regarded financial and real estate advisers, and the utilization of highly professional, competent and experienced contractors, sub-contractors and consultants who are well known to the Government.
 
Manufacturing and Production
 
The Company does not engage in any manufacturing activities.
 
LLC has land under development valued at 276,666,667 Omani Rials. The Company has recorded this land under development in its financial statements at $718,614,000 (based on a $2.5974 per 1 Omani Rial exchange rate) and the Company has allocated this amount as follows: 188,963,334 Omani Rials ($490,813,363) to inventory; and 87,703,333 Omani Rials ($227,800,637) to property. As the Omagine Project unfolds we presently expect that LLC will develop such land into an inventory of residential properties held for sale to third parties and into commercial properties which LLC will own, operate and/or lease.
Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks
 
It is presently intended that either LLC or Omagine will own (either outright or by assignment) the copyrights to all the material documents, designs and drawings produced and/or executed in relation to the Omagine Project by its employees and/or independent designers, architects and consultants.
 
Omagine has filed trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for the mark OMAGINE and six related marks (collectively, the “Marks”). Omagine has also filed trademark applications for the Marks in Oman and Kuwait within the applicable time periods required.
 
The Mark OMAGINE and three of the six related Marks have each been issued a Certificate of Registration from the USPTO and are now officially registered Marks in the United States (the “Registered Marks”).
 

27
--

 

The USPTO has issued a “Notice of Allowance” with respect to each of the remaining three related Marks (the “Expired Marks”) and the applications for such Expired Marks could have been approved for registration upon the filing of a valid “Statement of Use” attesting that each such Expired Mark was in commercial use. Due to the delays encountered by Omagine in signing the DA, the Expired Marks were not put into commercial use by the “Final Statement of Use Deadline” and all three applications for the Expired Marks have expired. The Expired Marks remain of interest to Omagine and, depending upon future circumstances, we may file new trademark applications for the Expired Marks with the USPTO.
 
Under USPTO rules continuous commercial use of the Registered Marks over the previous five year period were required to maintain valid registrations for such Registered Marks. The Registered Marks were not continuously used and therefore such Registered Marks will not be maintained by the USPTO. Ownership in the Registered Marks remain of interest to Omagine and, depending on future circumstances, the Company may file new trademark applications for the Marks to again become Registered Marks.
 
Trademark applications for the OMAGINE Mark and eight related Marks were filed in Oman and all were issued Certificates of Registration in Oman. As of the date hereof all registrations for the Oman Marks remain valid and in force. The Mark OMAGINE has been issued a Registration Certificate from the Patent and Trademark Department of the Ministry of Commerce & Industry in Kuwait and such Kuwait registration remains valid and in force as of the date hereof.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
LLC expects that it will require several Omani governmental licenses, permits and approvals for its services and products during the development, construction and operation of the Omagine Project (collectively, “Licenses and Permits”). The obligation of the Government of Oman to issue all such Licenses and Permits as may be required is specifically detailed in the DA (See: Exhibits 10.7 and 99.1). The Government of Oman has issued an ITC License to LLC for its Omagine Project (See: “Business - Sales and Marketing”, above).
 
The Company does not anticipate any negative effects on its or LLC’s business from any existing or probable Omani government laws or regulations. LLC will incur certain costs and sustain certain effects on its operations as a consequence of its compliance with Omani laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, and all such costs and effects are expected to be incurred or sustained as part of the normal course of its business.
 
The Company does not require any U.S. governmental approval of its properties, services, products or activities in Oman nor does the Company anticipate any negative effects on its business from any existing or probable United States or Oman government laws or regulations. Both the government of the United States and the government of the Sultanate of Oman have ratified the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement.
 
Employees, Consultants and Employment Benefits
 
As of the date hereof, we have five employees and ten consultants. We presently plan to hire seven of such consultants as full time employees of Omagine or LLC subsequent to the closing of a transaction with one or more investors or banks. None of our employees are represented by a labor union for purposes of collective bargaining. We consider our relations with our employees and consultants to be good. Subsequent to the closing of suitable financial arrangements by Omagine LLC, Omagine intends to significantly increase the number of its full time employees. (See: “Executive Compensation” – “Employment Benefits”).
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no assurances can be given at this time that the equity investments from interested potential third party investors or any debt financing from MENA Region banks will be closed; or the anticipated revenues from the Omagine Project will actually occur.
