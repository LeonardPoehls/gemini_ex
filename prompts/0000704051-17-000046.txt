ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
Legg Mason is a global asset management company. Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company-sponsored mutual funds and other pooled investment vehicles. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. We provide our asset management services through a number of asset managers, each of which generally markets its products and services under its own brand name and, in many cases, distributes retail products and services through a centralized global distribution platform.
Legg Mason, Inc. was incorporated in Maryland in 1981 to serve as a holding company for its various subsidiaries. The predecessor companies to Legg Mason trace back to Legg & Co., a Maryland-based broker-dealer formed in 1899. Our subsequent growth occurred primarily through internal expansion and the acquisition of asset management and broker-dealer firms. In December 2005, Legg Mason completed a transaction in which it sold its primary broker-dealer businesses to concentrate on the asset management industry.
Additional information about Legg Mason is available on our website at http://www.leggmason.com. We make available, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and our proxy statements. Investors can find this information under the “Investor Relations” section of our website.

References to “fiscal year 2017” or other fiscal years refer to the 12-month period ended March 31st of the year specified.
Business Developments During the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2017
The asset management industry continues to experience disruption and challenges, including a shift to lower-fee passively managed products and changing fee pressure (including pressure arising from the shift to lower-fee passive products), regulatory changes and an increased role of technology in asset management services. During fiscal year 2017, in addition to the normal course operations of our business, we took the following actions to improve our positioning to successfully navigate the changing industry landscape: 

• | On April 13, 2016, we acquired an 82% equity interest in Clarion Partners, a diversified real estate asset management firm based in New York. The Clarion Partners management team retained 18% of the outstanding equity in Clarion Partners. The acquisition of Clarion Partners fills gaps in our illiquid alternative product offerings.


• | On May 2, 2016, we combined the Permal Group (“Permal”), our existing hedge fund of funds platform, with EnTrust Capital ("EnTrust"), a leading alternative asset management firm headquartered in New York with largely complementary investment strategies, investor base, and business mix to Permal. As a result of the combination, we own 65% of the combined entity, branded EnTrustPermal, and 35% is owned by EnTrustPermal's chief executive officer. The combination of the businesses of EnTrust and Permal created a new global alternatives solutions firm.

• | On August 8, 2016, we completed the issuance and sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.45% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2056 (the “5.45% Notes”). The net proceeds of the offering, together with cash on hand, were used to repay $500 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 


• | On August 17, 2016, we completed the acquisition of an 82% interest in Financial Guard LLC, an online Registered Investment Advisor and innovative technology-enabled wealth management and investment advice platform. Financial Guard operates as part of our alternative distribution strategies business, which focuses on combining technology with our investment affiliates’ capabilities in order to better serve clients.


• | During fiscal year 2017, we streamlined our business by divesting our interests in two small non-core asset managers and a joint venture with a former employee, which at the time of their respective divestitures, managed $0.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion of AUM. 

See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for the revenues, net income and assets of Legg Mason, which operates in a single reportable business segment. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for our revenues generated in, and our long-lived assets (consisting primarily of intangible assets and goodwill) located in, each of the principal geographic regions in which we conduct business. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and in all other countries, in aggregate.
Business Overview
Acting through our subsidiaries, we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients, company-sponsored investment funds and retail separately managed account programs. Operating from asset management offices located in the United States, the United Kingdom and a number of other countries worldwide, our businesses provide a broad array of investment management products and services. We offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. Our investment advisory services include discretionary and non-discretionary management of separate investment accounts in numerous investment styles for institutional and individual investors. Our investment products include proprietary mutual funds ranging from money market and other liquidity products to fixed income, equity and alternative funds managed in a wide variety of investment styles. We also offer other domestic and offshore funds to both retail and institutional investors, privately placed real estate funds and funds-of-hedge funds. 
Our subsidiary asset managers primarily earn revenues by charging fees for managing the investment assets of clients. Fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM; accordingly, the fee income of each of our asset managers will typically increase or decrease as its average AUM increases or decreases. In addition, the fees on our AUM vary with the type of account managed, the amount of assets in the account, the asset manager and the type of client. Increases in AUM generally result from inflows of additional assets from new and existing clients and from appreciation in the value of client assets (including investment income earned on client assets and due to changes in currency exchange rates). Conversely, decreases in AUM generally result from client redemptions and declines in the value of client assets. Our AUM may also increase as a result of business acquisitions, or decrease as a result of dispositions.
We may earn performance fees under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks or hurdle rates. The largest portion of our performance fees is earned based on 12-month performance periods that end in differing quarters during the year, with a portion based on quarterly performance periods. We also earn performance fees on alternative products that are earned at the end of varying investment periods or in multiple-year intervals. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, of our $2.9 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion in total revenues, $108.3 million, $42.0 million and $83.5 million, respectively represented performance fees. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, $60.8 million of these performance fees were earned by Clarion Partners on assets invested with them prior to the closing of the acquisition in April 2016 and are passed through as compensation to Clarion Partners’ management team pursuant to the terms of the Clarion Partners acquisition. As of March 31, 2017, approximately 11% of our total AUM was in accounts that were eligible to pay performance fees.

As of March 31 of each of the last three fiscal years, we had the following aggregate AUM (in billions, except percentages):

 | AssetsUnderManagement | | EquityAssets | | % of Total inEquity Assets | | FixedIncomeAssets | % of Total inFixed IncomeAssets | | Alternative Assets | | % of Total in AlternativeAssets | LiquidityAssets | | % of Total in LiquidityAssets
2017 | $ | 728.4 | | | $ | 179.8 | | 25 | % | | $ | 394.3 | | 54 | % | $ | 67.9 | | 9 | % | | $ | 86.4 | 12 | %
2016 | 669.6 | | | 162.3 | | | 24 | | 372.3 | | | 56 | | 22.7 | | 3 | | 112.3 | | | 17 | 
2015 | 702.7 | | | 186.2 | | | 26 | | 370.1 | | | 53 | | 19.2 | | 3 | | 127.2 | | | 18 | 

From time to time, our reported equity, fixed income or alternative assets under management may exclude assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term or temporary basis. Beginning in fiscal year 2017, we began reporting Alternative Assets as part of our AUM classifications. We currently define Alternative Assets as all AUM managed by Clarion Partners, EnTrustPermal, RARE Infrastructure or Glouston Capital Partners (prior to its sale on March 31, 2017). All prior periods have been revised to present Alternative Assets.
We believe that market conditions and our investment performance are critical elements in our attempts to grow our AUM and business. When securities and real estate markets are increasing, our AUM will tend to increase because of market performance, resulting in additional asset management revenues. Similarly, if we can produce positive investment results and maintain competitive fee levels, our AUM will tend to increase. In addition, favorable market conditions or strong relative investment performance can result in increased inflows in assets from existing and new clients. Conversely, in periods when securities or real estate markets are weak or declining, or when we have not maintained competitive fee levels or have produced poor investment performance, absolute or relative to benchmarks or peers, it is likely to be more difficult to grow our AUM and business and, in such periods, our AUM and business may decline.
We generally manage the accounts of our clients pursuant to written investment management or sub-advisory contracts between one of our asset managers and the client (or a financial intermediary acting on behalf of the client). These contracts usually specify, among other things, the management fees to be paid to the asset manager and the investment strategy for the account, and are generally terminable by either party on relatively short notice. Typically, investment management contracts may not be assigned (including as a result of transactions, such as a direct or indirect change of control of the asset manager, if it would constitute an assignment under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or other applicable regulatory requirements) without the prior consent of the client. When the asset management client is a U.S. registered mutual fund or closed-end fund (whether or not one of our asset managers has sponsored the fund), the fund's board of directors generally must annually approve the investment management contract, and any material changes to the contract, and the fund’s board of directors and fund shareholders must approve any assignment of the contract (including as a result of transactions that would constitute an assignment under the Investment Company Act of 1940).
We conduct the majority of our business through our asset managers. Our asset managers are individual businesses, each of which generally focuses on a portion of the asset management industry in terms of the types of assets managed (primarily alternatives, equity or fixed income), the types of products and services offered, the investment styles utilized, the distribution channels used, and the types and geographic locations of its clients. Each asset manager is housed in one or more different subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2017, we directly or indirectly owned all of the voting equity of Brandywine Global Investment Management, ClearBridge Investments, Martin Currie, QS Investors and Western Asset Management Company. Clarion Partners is 18% owned by its management team, EnTrustPermal is 35% owned by its chief executive officer, Royce is 19% owned by its management team, and RARE Infrastructure is 15% owned by its management team and 10% owned by a third party. In addition, the management teams at Clarion Partners and ClearBridge Investments each owns non-voting equity interests in the business which provide them with participation in any increase in the value of the business (subject to appropriate discounts). During fiscal year 2017, we also had one joint venture that we owned with a former employee. On February 24, 2017, we sold our interest in that joint venture to the former employee.
Each of our primary asset managers is generally operated as a separate business, in many cases with certain distribution functions being provided by the parent company and other affiliates, that typically markets its products and services under its own brand name. Consistent with this approach, we have in place revenue sharing arrangements with certain of our asset managers: Brandywine Global Investment Management, ClearBridge Investments, RARE Infrastructure, 
4

Royce & Associates, and Western Asset Management Company, and/or certain of their key officers. Pursuant to these revenue sharing arrangements, a specified percentage of the asset manager's revenues, net of certain third party distribution expenses, is required to be distributed to the equity owners of the business and the balance of the revenues (or net revenues) is retained to pay operating expenses, including salaries and bonuses, but excluding certain expenses such as amortization of acquired intangible assets and excluding income taxes. Specific compensation allocations are determined by the asset manager's management, subject to corporate management approval in certain cases. Although, without renegotiation, the revenue sharing arrangements impede our ability to increase our profit margins from these businesses, we believe these arrangements help us retain and attract talented employees. In addition, the revenue sharing arrangements provide management of these asset managers with incentives to (i) grow the asset managers' revenues, since management is able to participate in the revenue growth through the portion that is retained; and (ii) control operating expenses, which will increase the portion of the revenues retained that is available to fund growth initiatives and for incentive compensation. In addition, the chief executive officer of EnTrustPermal and the management teams of Clarion Partners, ClearBridge, Royce and RARE Infrastructure have significant equity interests in the applicable company, which helps to align the interests of the management of those affiliates with the interests of our shareholders.

Our asset managers provide a wide range of investment advisory services to separately managed account clients, including institutional clients such as pension and other retirement plans, corporations, insurance companies, endowments and foundations and governments, as well as retail clients such as high net worth individuals and families, and retail separately managed account programs.

Private Funds
In addition to our U.S. mutual funds and ETFs, our investment affiliates sponsor and manage various unregistered, or “private” funds that are made available to qualified U.S. or non-U.S. investors, depending upon the product. Private funds are pooled investment vehicles that are exempt from local regulation and that are typically offered to sophisticated, high net worth investors, corporations, sovereign wealth funds, public pension plans and other pooled investment vehicles.

Retail Separately Managed Account Programs
We are a leading provider of asset management services to retail separately managed account programs, commonly known as managed account or wrap programs. These programs typically allow securities brokers or other financial intermediaries to offer their clients the opportunity to choose from a number of asset management services pursuing different investment strategies provided by one or more asset managers, and generally charge an all-inclusive fee that covers asset management, trade execution, asset allocation and custodial and administrative services. We provide investment management services through more than 140 retail separately managed account programs sponsored by various financial institutions.
Distribution
Our centralized global distribution group, Legg Mason Global Distribution, operates two divisions, the U.S. Distribution Group and the International Distribution Group. The U.S. Distribution Group markets, distributes and supports our U.S. mutual funds, ETFs and retail separately managed account programs. The International Distribution Group markets, distributes and supports our international funds. In general, our U.S. and international sales and marketing teams are housed in separate subsidiaries from our asset managers.
In addition, each of our asset managers has its own sales and marketing teams that distribute its products and services, primarily, in most cases, to institutional investors. The institutional sales and marketing teams of our asset managers distribute asset management services to potential clients, both directly and through consultants. Consultants play a large role in institutional asset management by helping clients select and retain asset managers. Institutional asset management clients and their consultants tend to be highly sophisticated and investment performance-driven.    
U.S. Distribution
The U.S. Distribution Group of Legg Mason Global Distribution employs a team of U.S. based sales, marketing and support staff that market, distribute and support our U.S. mutual funds, including the Legg Mason Funds, the Royce Funds, the Clarion Funds and the Legg Mason ETFs. Our mutual fund wholesalers distribute the Legg Mason Funds through a number of third-party distributors.
The U.S. Distribution Group distributes institutional share classes of the Legg Mason Funds to institutional clients and also distributes variable annuity sub-advisory services provided by our asset managers to insurance companies (including advisory services provided to certain of the Legg Mason Funds that are specifically designed for purchase through variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies offered by participating insurance companies). Our institutional liquidity funds are primarily distributed by Western Asset Management's sales team. The Royce Funds are distributed by Royce’s sales team in addition to the U.S. Distribution Group. 
In addition to distributing funds, the wholesalers in Legg Mason Global Distribution also market and support our retail separately managed account program services and the Legg Mason ETFs. These services are provided through programs sponsored by a variety of financial institutions. 
International Distribution
The International Distribution Group of Legg Mason Global Distribution employs a team of sales, marketing and support staff that markets, distributes and supports our international funds to individual and institutional investors across Asia (including Australian and Japan), Europe and the Americas. The International Distribution Group has sales teams operating out of distribution offices in 16 cities in 13 countries and distributing our cross border international funds globally and our international local fund ranges in their respective countries. The goal of our International Distribution Group is to be a global partner for firms that utilize or distribute asset management products around the world, but also to be viewed as a local partner through an understanding of the nuances and needs of each local market that they cover. These distributors seek to develop deep distribution relationships with retail banks, private banks, asset managers, fund platforms, pension plans and insurance plans. Our international distribution offices also work with our asset managers on a case-by-case basis 
8

to take advantage of preferences for local distributors or to meet regulatory requirements in distributing products and services into their local markets.
Our distribution efforts are not limited to the locations where we have offices, as the International Distribution Group distributes cross border funds in more than 25 countries around the world. This global presence provides Legg Mason with the capabilities to provide a platform of sales, service, marketing and products that can cater to the different distribution dynamics in each of the regions that it covers. Client coverage is local, coordinated across regions, and encompasses multiple distribution channels including broker-dealers, funds-of-funds, asset managers, independent financial advisers, banks, fund platforms, insurance companies and other distribution partners. The extent to which each channel takes precedence in any one market is governed by local market dynamics.
In Australia, our distribution operations distribute local and cross border funds sub-advised by our asset managers primarily to retail investors, pension plans, fund-of-funds managers, insurance companies and government funds/agencies. In Japan, our distribution operations distribute domestic investment funds, cross border funds and institutional separate accounts primarily to the retail market, which includes retail banks, private banks, asset managers, funds platforms and insurance companies.
EnTrustPermal's products and services are sold outside the United States to non-U.S. high net worth investors through a network of financial intermediaries by EnTrustPermal's distribution operations as well as through our International Distribution Group. In addition, EnTrustPermal distributes its products and services to U.S. and international institutions through EnTrustPermal's internal distribution teams.
 Employees
At March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had 3,338, 3,066 and 2,982 employees, respectively. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. However, competition for experienced asset management personnel is intense and from time to time we may experience a loss of valuable personnel. We recognize the importance to our business of hiring, training and retaining skilled professionals.
Competition
We are engaged in an extremely competitive business and are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business. Our competition includes, with respect to one or more aspects of our business, numerous international and domestic asset management firms and broker-dealers, mutual fund complexes, hedge funds, commercial banks, insurance companies, other investment companies and other financial institutions. Many of these organizations offer products and services that are similar to, or compete with, those we offer, and many of these organizations have substantially more personnel and greater financial resources than we have. Some of these competitors have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them. In addition, many of our competitors have long-standing and established relationships with distributors and clients. The principal competitive factors relating to our business are the quality of advice and services provided to investors, the performance records of that advice and service, the reputation of the company providing the services, the price of the services, the products and services offered and distribution relationships and compensation offered to distributors.
Competition in our business periodically has been affected by significant developments in the asset management industry. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Asset Management Business - Competition in the Asset Management Industry Could Reduce our Revenues and Net Income.”
Regulation
The asset management industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state securities and other laws. The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws. Our distribution activities also may be subject to regulation by federal agencies, self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions in those states in which we conduct business. In addition, asset management firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments, securities exchanges, central banks and regulatory bodies, particularly in those countries where they have established offices. Due to the extensive laws and regulations to which we are subject, we must devote substantial 
9

time, expense and effort to remaining vigilant about, and addressing, legal and regulatory compliance matters. Moreover, regulatory changes in one jurisdiction often affect our business operations in other jurisdictions.
Virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients and investors in registered and unregistered investment companies. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from conducting business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Regulators also have a variety of informal enforcement mechanisms available that could have a significant impact on our business. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines. A regulatory proceeding, regardless of whether it results in a sanction, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse effect on our reputation or business.
Regulatory Reform
We are subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact us by leading to business disruptions, requiring us to change certain business practices and exposing us to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs). The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.
U.S. Executive Order

On February 3, 2017, a U.S. presidential executive order (the “Executive Order”) articulated certain core principles for regulating the U.S. financial system and directed the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury to report to the President within 120 days on the extent to which existing laws, treaties, rules, regulations and policies promote, support or inhibit the federal regulation of the U.S. financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles. The scope and potential impact of any regulatory changes resulting from the Executive order are unclear and we will continue to monitor the potential impact of the Executive Order on our business.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions, many of which have been adopted and others of which will be forthcoming. As the impact of these rules will become evident over time, it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that the Dodd-Frank Act or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions will have on us. In April 2017, the House Financial Services Committee held hearings on the Financial CHOICE Act, a proposal that aims to reverse many features of the Dodd-Frank Act, make targeted changes to many aspects of Dodd-Frank and address a variety of other financial reform matters. It is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that the CHOICE Act, if enacted, or any subsequent regulations and decisions will have on us.
Systemically Important Financial Institution Review
On July 31, 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) principals directed the staff to undertake a more focused analysis of industry-wide products and activities to assess potential risks associated with the asset management industry, and on December 18, 2014 the FSOC issued a Request for Information related to this analysis. On April 18, 2016, the FSOC released a statement providing an update on its review of asset management products and activities and their potential risks to U.S. financial stability. The statement outlines FSOC’s recent analysis of risks focused on the following areas: (i) liquidity and redemption; (ii) leverage; (iii) operational functions; (iv) securities lending; and (v) resolvability and transition planning. The statement also includes the FSOC’s views on ways to mitigate potential financial instability risk relating to such areas.
10

On January 8, 2014, the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) issued a consultative document on proposed methodologies to identify nonbank/noninsurance global systemically important financial institutions (“G-SIFI”). 
Both the FSB, working with the IOSCO, and the FSOC, are considering potential systemic risk related to asset management and are currently focused on a products and activities approach in their review of asset managers. In January 2017, the FSB recently announced its Policy Recommendations to Address Structural Vulnerabilities from Asset Management Activities, which concentrates primarily on products and activities and includes 14 recommendations largely focused on liquidity in open-end funds, leverage in funds, operational risk, and securities lending, certain of which IOSCO is expected to engage on in the future.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we could be designated a systemically important financial institution (“SIFI”) and become subject to direct supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). In the United States, the FSOC has not indicated whether or not it intends to designate any asset managers as SIFIs. The FSB has indicated that it may develop criteria for designation of nonbank non-insurers in the future to address “residual risks”. If we or any other asset manager were designated a SIFI or G-SIFI, we could become subject to enhanced prudential, capital, supervisory and other requirements, such as risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements, concentration limits, a contingent capital requirement, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits and overall risk management requirements. Requirements such as these, which were designed to regulate banking institutions, would likely need to be modified to be applicable to an asset manager. No proposals have been made indicating how such measures would be adapted for asset managers.

Securities and Exchange Commission Review of Asset Managers and Mutual Funds
Our business may also be impacted by additional regulatory initiatives by the SEC. In December 2014, the Chair of the SEC recommended that the SEC enhance its oversight of asset managers by (i) expanding and updating data requirements with which asset managers must comply, (ii) improving fund level controls, including those related to liquidity levels and the nature of specific instruments and (iii) ensuring that asset management firms have appropriate transition plans in place to deal with market stress events or situations where an investment adviser is no longer able to serve its clients. In August 2016, the SEC adopted amendments to Form ADV, the form filed by an investment adviser to register with the SEC as an investment adviser, to require that a registered investment adviser provide additional and more detailed information about itself and the separately managed accounts (i.e., non-pooled investment vehicles) that it advises, including information on the types of assets held in client accounts and the use of derivatives and borrowings in client accounts. In October 2016, the SEC adopted new rules (as well as amendments to existing rules) to modernize the reporting and disclosure of information by registered investment companies. Any additional SEC oversight relating to the above, or the introduction of any new reporting, disclosure or control requirements could expose us to additional compliance costs and may require us to change how we operate our business.
Regulation of Derivatives
The SEC, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) each continue to review the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives by mutual funds. Such reviews could result in regulations that further limit the use of such products by mutual funds. If adopted, these limitations could require us to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the CFTC, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions. We also report certain information about a number of our private funds to the SEC and certain information to the CFTC, under systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies. These reporting obligations have required, and will continue to require, investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting. The rules and regulations applicable to offshore funds, accounts and counterparties will require us to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which we will be subject. These rule changes also introduce new requirements for centrally clearing certain swap, and eventually security-based swap, transactions and for executing certain swap, and eventually security-based swap, transactions on or through CFTC or SEC-registered trading venues. Jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate also have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact us and the broader markets. This includes the implementation of mandated central clearing of swaps in the European Union (“EU”) and the implementation of trade reporting, documentation, central clearing and other requirements in various jurisdictions globally.

Use of Derivatives by US Registered Investment Companies - SEC Proposed Rule
On December 11, 2015 the SEC proposed a new exemptive rule designed to provide an updated and more comprehensive approach to the regulation of US mutual funds’ use of derivatives. The proposed rule would permit mutual funds, ETFs, closed-end funds, and companies that have elected to be treated as business development companies under the Act to enter into derivatives transactions and financial commitment transactions, notwithstanding the prohibitions and restrictions on the issuance of senior securities under the Act, provided that the funds comply with the conditions of the proposed rule. A fund that relies on the proposed rule in order to enter into derivatives transactions would be required to: comply with one of two alternative portfolio limitations designed to impose a limit on the amount of leverage the fund may obtain through derivatives transactions and other senior securities transactions; manage the risks associated with the fund’s derivatives transactions by maintaining an amount of certain assets, defined in the proposed rule as “qualifying coverage assets,” designed to enable the fund to meet its obligations under its derivatives transactions; and, depending on the extent of its derivatives usage, establish a formalized derivatives risk management program. A fund that relies on the proposed rule in order to enter into financial commitment transactions would be required to maintain qualifying coverage assets equal in value to the fund’s full obligations under those transactions. The potential impact of the new rule, which is still subject to change and is likely to have a lengthy transition period prior to implementation, on the funds and/or our business remains unclear.
Regulation of Exchange Traded Funds 
As a result of market volatility, regulators globally are examining the potential risks in ETFs, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. Depending on the outcome of this regulatory review, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require us to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect our business.
Benchmark Reform
In 2013, the IOSCO published principles for regulatory oversight of financial benchmarks, with standards applying to methodologies for benchmark calculation, and transparency and governance issues in the benchmarking process. Regulators in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate are analyzing the application of these principles, with a draft European Regulation published in September 2013. In July 2014, the FSB published a report aimed at reforming major interest rate benchmarks. These regulations may result in business disruptions or strictly control the activities of financial services firms.
Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive
Our European business is impacted by the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), which became effective on July 21, 2011. The AIFMD regulates managers of, and service providers to, a broad range of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) domiciled within and (depending on the precise circumstances) outside the EU. The AIFMD also regulates the marketing of all AIFs inside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The AIFMD is being implemented in stages, which run through 2018. Compliance with the AIFMD’s requirements restrict alternative investment fund marketing and impose additional compliance and disclosure obligations regarding remuneration, capital requirements, leverage, valuation, stakes in EU companies, depositaries, the domicile of custodians and liquidity management on us. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional expenses related satisfying these new compliance and disclosure obligations and the associated risk management and reporting requirements.
Markets in Financial Instrument Directives
We are subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives in Europe. The United Kingdom and other European jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) rules into national legislation, and have begun to implement MiFID 2. MiFID 2 builds upon many of the initiatives introduced through MiFID, which focused primarily on equities, to encourage trading across all asset classes to migrate onto open and transparent markets. MiFID 2, which will come into full effect in January 2018, will be implemented through a number of more detailed directives, regulations and standards to be made by the European Commission and by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”). It is expected that MiFID 2 will have significant and wide-ranging impacts on EU securities and derivatives markets, including (i) enhanced investor protection and governance standards, (ii) rules regarding the ability of 
12

portfolio management firms to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes, (iii) enhanced regulation of algorithmic trading, (iv) the movement of trading in certain shares and derivatives onto regulated execution venues, (v) the extension of pre- and post-trade transparency requirements to wider categories of financial instruments, (vi) restrictions on the use of so-called dark pool trading, (vii) the creation of a new type of trading venue called the Organized Trading Facility for non-equity financial instruments, (viii) commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements, (ix) a move away from vertical silos in execution, clearing and settlement, (x) an enhanced role for ESMA in supervising EU securities and derivatives markets and (xi) new requirements regarding non-EU investment firms’ access to EU financial markets. Implementation of these measures will have direct and indirect impacts on us and certain of our affiliates, including significant changes to client servicing models, distribution models, the fees we are able to charge to clients and the way that our affiliates execute investment decisions for client portfolios. 
The United Kingdom has implemented rules regarding retail distribution review (the “RDR”) aimed at enhancing consumer protections, overhauling mutual fund fee structures and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector. In order to achieve this, RDR requires advisory firms to explicitly disclose and separately charge clients for their services and clearly describe their services as either independent or restricted. It also requires individual advisers to adhere to consistent professional standards, including a code of ethics. Similarly, MiFID 2 will contain a ban on certain advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers. These rules, if implemented, may lead to changes to the fees and commissions we are able to charge to our clients, as well as to our client servicing and distribution models.
Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities
The EU has adopted directives on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”) with respect to depositary functions, remuneration policies and sanctions. UCITS V, which was required to be incorporated into the national law of each EU member state by second quarter of 2016, seeks to align the depositary regime, remuneration rules and sanctioning powers of regulators under UCITS with the requirements of the AIFMD. In addition, ESMA guidelines include rules relating to collateral management requirements for UCITS funds concerning collateral received in the context of derivatives using Efficient Portfolio Management (“EPM”) techniques (including securities lending) and over-the-counter derivative transactions. These rules required us to make a series of changes to collateral management arrangements applicable to the EPM of UCITS fund ranges and cause us to incur additional expenses associated with risk management and reporting requirements. 
British Exit from the European Union 
The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the EU ("Brexit"), which resulted in significant volatility in several international markets. On March 29, 2017, the U.K. delivered notice under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty of its intent to leave the EU, beginning a two year negotiation period for the U.K. and the 27 remaining members of the EU to reach agreement on the terns of the exit. Unless the UK and the remaining EU member states agree to extend the deadline for exit negotiations, the UK will leave the EU on March 29, 2019. The outcome of the negotiations between the U.K. and the EU and the long-term consequences of the vote and resulting negotiations are uncertain. We will continue to monitor the potential impact of Brexit on our business operations and financial condition.
Existing U.S. Regulation
Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisers with the SEC, as are several of our international asset managers, and are also required to make notice filings in certain states. We and certain of our affiliates are also currently subject to regulation by the SEC, the Department of Labor (the “DOL”), the Federal Reserve, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the CFTC and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of our affiliates are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies.

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as certain of our asset managers, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act of 1940 imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and 
13

distributors. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.
Our trading and investment activities for client accounts are also regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements and market regulation policies in the United States and globally.    
Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, principally FINRA. These self-regulatory organizations have adopted extensive regulatory requirements relating to matters such as sales practices, compensation and disclosure, and conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers in accordance with rules they have adopted and amended from time to time, subject to approval by the SEC. The SEC, self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or registered employees. These administrative proceedings, whether or not resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation or business of a broker-dealer. The principal purpose of regulation and discipline of broker-dealers is the protection of clients and the securities markets, rather than protection of creditors and stockholders of the regulated entity.
In addition, our asset managers also may be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and related regulations, particularly insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA imposes duties on persons who are fiduciaries of ERISA plan clients, and ERISA and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of ERISA plan and Individual Retirement Account (“IRA”) clients and certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and several other related parties) to such clients. In April 2016, the Department of Labor, which administers ERISA, issued a final fiduciary rule, with an applicability date of April 10, 2017, expanding the circumstances in which advice furnished to retirement investors will be treated as fiduciary in nature as well as related prohibited transaction class exemptions. On February 3, 2017, a presidential memorandum directed the Department of Labor to examine the fiduciary rule’s impact and to prepare an updated economic and legal analysis of the rule (the “DoL Memorandum”), which could lead to the fiduciary rule being revised or rescinded. On the same day, the Department of Labor issued a statement that it would consider its legal options to delay the applicability date of the fiduciary rule as it complies with the DoL Memorandum. On April 4, 2017, the Department of Labor announced a 60-day delay in the rule’s applicability date from April 10, 2017 until June 9, 2017. The announcement indicated that the Department of Labor’s re-examination of the rule likely would extend past June 9, 2017 and that the rule would become applicable on June 9, 2017 even if its re-examination of the rule has not been completed by that date. Implementation of the fiduciary rule is subject to further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments. The fiduciary rule and exemptions are focused on financial intermediaries who provide advice to institutional and retail retirement plan clients, including the third-party distributors who market and sell Legg Mason Funds and separately managed account program services, and mandate increased disclosure of financial intermediary compensation and mitigation of conflicts of interest. We and our asset managers may be adversely impacted by the fiduciary rule and exemptions to the extent that they lead to changes in financial intermediary and retirement plan investment preferences and increased pressure on product fees and expenses.
The SEC adopted final rules on money market fund reform which became effective in October 2016. These rules require any institutional prime money market fund and any institutional municipal (or tax-exempt) money market fund that is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 to utilize market-based valuations to calculate a floating net asset value (“NAV”) and require all non-government money market funds to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain conditions. Government and retail money market funds can continue using current pricing and accounting methods to seek to maintain a stable NAV. These reforms have had a negative impact on the attractiveness of such funds to investors and subject us to additional regulatory requirements and costs to comply with such requirements.
 Also in October 2016, the SEC adopted a new rule (and amendments to existing rules) designed to promote effective liquidity risk management throughout the open-end fund industry, thereby reducing the risk that funds will be unable to meet redemption obligations and mitigating dilution of the interests of fund shareholders. The amendments also seek to enhance disclosure regarding fund liquidity and redemption practices. New rule 22e-4 will require each registered open-end fund, 
14

including open-end ETFs (but not including money market funds), to establish a liquidity risk management program. The Commission also adopted amendments to existing rule 22c-1 to permit a fund, under certain circumstances, to use “swing pricing,” the process of adjusting the NAV of a fund’s shares to effectively pass on the costs stemming from shareholder purchase or redemption activity to the shareholders associated with that activity. The funds are required to comply with rule 22e-4 beginning on December 1, 2018. The SEC delayed the effective date of the amendments that will permit funds to use swing pricing until November 2018 to provide funds, intermediaries and service providers time to work through operational issues. The potential impact of the new and amended rules on the funds and/or our business is unclear.
Existing International Regulation
In our international business, we have fund management, asset management, broker-dealer and distribution subsidiaries domiciled in a number of jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Japan, Hong Kong, Ireland, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan and the United Kingdom that are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of, and to supervision by, governmental authorities and regulatory agencies in each of these jurisdictions. Our international subsidiaries are also authorized or licensed to offer their products and services in several other countries around the world, and thus are subject to the laws of, and to supervision by, governmental authorities in these additional countries. In addition, a subsidiary of EnTrustPermal, for which we have entered into an agreement to sell, is a Bahamas bank regulated by the Central Bank of the Bahamas. In some instances, our international subsidiaries are also affected by U.S. laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application. Our offshore proprietary funds are subject to the laws and regulatory bodies of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and, for funds listed on exchanges, to the rules of the applicable exchanges. Certain of our funds domiciled in Ireland are also registered for public sale in several countries around the world and are subject to the laws of, and supervision by, the governmental authorities of those countries. All of these non-U.S. governmental authorities generally have broad supervisory and disciplinary powers, including, among others, the power to set minimum capital requirements, to temporarily or permanently revoke the authorization to carry on regulated business, to suspend registered employees, and to invoke censures and fines for both the regulated business and its registered employees.
The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) currently regulates certain of our affiliates in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FCA is required to conduct certain financial services related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FCA’s rules adopted under that Act govern capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients, and systems and controls. The FCA monitors our compliance with its requirements through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic based reviews. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions.
In addition, certain of our affiliates must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by MiFID, which became effective on November 1, 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the wider EEA. MiFID, the scope of which is being enhanced through MiFID 2, sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements.
Certain of our affiliates are subject to an EU regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which was adopted in August 2012 and which requires (i) the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts from February 2014.
In Australia, our affiliates are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC is Australia’s corporate, markets and financial services regulator and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection.
Net Capital Requirements
We have several small, non-clearing broker-dealer subsidiaries that primarily distribute our funds and other asset management products. These broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to net capital rules that mandate that they maintain certain levels of capital. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries that operate outside the United States are subject to net capital or liquidity requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. For example, in addition to requirements in other jurisdictions, our United Kingdom-based subsidiaries and our Singapore-based subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of the FCA and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, respectively.
