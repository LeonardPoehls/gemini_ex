Item 1. Business
Overview
Our Company
As previously disclosed, on April 17, 2017, FGL terminated its Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Anbang Merger Agreement”) with Anbang Insurance Group Co., Ltd. and its affiliates. As a result of the termination, FGL has no remaining obligations under the Anbang Merger Agreement.
 On May 24, 2017, FGL entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among CF Corporation, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“CF Corp”), FGL US Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of CF Corp (“Parent”), FGL Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”) and FGL.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the time of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into FGL (the "Merger") with FGL continuing as the surviving entity, which will become an, wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of CF Corp.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each issued and outstanding share of common stock of FGL (the "Common Stock") will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive $31.10 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”), other than any shares of Common Stock owned by FGL as treasury stock or otherwise or owned by CF Corp, Parent or Merger Sub (which will be cancelled and no payment will be made with respect thereto), shares of Common Stock granted pursuant to the Company Equity Plan (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and those shares of Common Stock with respect to which appraisal rights under Delaware law are properly exercised and not withdrawn. The Merger Agreement permits FGL to pay out a regular quarterly cash dividend on its Common Stock prior to the closing of the transaction in an amount not in excess of $0.065 per share, per quarter (the per share amount of FGL’s most recently declared quarterly dividend).
At the Effective Time, each (i) option to purchase shares of Common Stock (a “Company Stock Option”), (ii) restricted share of Common Stock and (iii) performance-based restricted stock unit relating to shares of Common Stock (an “RSU”), in each case whether vested or unvested, will become fully vested and automatically converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares subject to the award (for RSUs, determined at the target performance level) multiplied by (2) the Merger Consideration (less the exercise price per share in the case of Company Stock Options). In addition, at the Effective Time, each stock option (“FGLH Stock Option”) and restricted stock unit relating to shares of FGLH, whether vested or unvested, will become fully vested and automatically converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of FGLH stock subject to the award multiplied by (B) $176.32 (less the exercise price in the case of such FGLH Stock Options), and each dividend equivalent held in respect of a share of FGLH stock (a “DER”), whether vested or unvested, will become fully vested and automatically converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the amount accrued with respect to such DER.
Following execution of the Merger Agreement, FS Holdco II Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“FS Holdco”), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of HRG Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“HRG”), holding a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, executed and delivered to FGL a written consent (the “Consent”), approving and adopting the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. As a result of the execution and delivery of the Consent, the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of FGL’s common stock have adopted and approved the Merger Agreement. 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, the following of which have been met: (i) on June 16, 2017, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (ii) on August 8, 2017, CF Corp held an extraordinary general meeting in lieu of an annual general meeting of shareholders, at which CF Corp’s shareholders approved, among other items, all of the proposals relating to the Merger Agreement and the Merger; (iii) on August 14, 2017, FGL filed with the SEC and mailed to its stockholders a definitive information statement in connection with the Merger; (iv) on August 24, 2017, the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation granted its required regulatory approval relating to the Merger; and (v) on November 8, 2017, the New York Department of Financial Services granted its required regulatory approval relating to the Merger. On November 7, 2017, the Iowa Insurance Division held a public 
6

hearing to consider whether the proposed acquisition of control of Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company complies with the standards set forth under applicable Iowa insurance laws.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the consummation of the Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain additional closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals from the Iowa Insurance Division, and the absence of any law or order enacted, issued or enforced that is in effect and that prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger. 
The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of FGL, CF Corp, Parent and Merger Sub. Among other things, FGL and its subsidiaries are required to conduct their respective businesses and operations in the ordinary course of business until the Merger is consummated.
The Merger Agreement contains certain provisions giving each of CF Corp, Parent and FGL rights to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement, under specified circumstances, FGL may be required to pay a termination fee to CF Corp in an aggregate amount of $50.
FGL and CF Corp are committed to securing the remaining regulatory approvals and seek to close the Merger as expeditiously as possible, however, the closing of the Merger and the timing thereof is subject to the regulatory review and approval process, none of which can be assured.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and should be read concurrently with the other related disclosure in this report, and is subject to and qualified by in its entirety by reference to the text of the Merger Agreement filed with the SEC. FGL has filed with the SEC and mailed to its stockholders the definitive information statement. The definitive information statement and other relevant materials contain important information about FGL, CF Corp, the Merger and related matters. These documents are available at no charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, documents are also available for free from FGL by contacting FGL’s investor relations department at Investor.Relations@fglife.com.
For over 50 years, our Company has been helping middle-income Americans prepare for retirement and unexpected loss of life. Our focus on the middle-income market gives us access to significant, underserved market niches and drives our product development. As of September 30, 2017, we had approximately 700,000 policyholders counting on the safety and protection features of our fixed annuity and life insurance products, and we constantly seek to innovate our products to meet their evolving needs. We offer our products through a network of approximately 200 independent IMOs that in turn represent an estimated 37,000 independent agents. 
Through the efforts of our 299 employees, who are primarily located in Baltimore, MD and Des Moines, IA, we offer various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Fixed annuities represent a retirement and savings tool which our customers rely on for principal protection and predictable income streams. In addition, our life insurance products provide our customers with a complementary product that allows them to build on their savings and assign payment of a death benefit to a designated beneficiary upon the policyholder’s death. Currently, our most popular products are fixed indexed annuities (“FIAs”) that tie contractual returns to specific market indices, such as the Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") 500 Index. The benefit of FIAs to our customers is to provide a portion of the gains of an underlying market index, while providing principal protection. We believe this mix of “some upside but limited downside” fills the need for middle-income Americans who must save for retirement but who want to limit the risk of decline in their savings. In addition to FIAs, we also sell indexed universal life policies (“IULs”) and other fixed annuities. 
In Fiscal 2017, FIAs generated approximately 72% of our total sales and the remaining 28% of sales was primarily generated from fixed annuity sales during the year. We invest the annuity premiums primarily in fixed income securities and options that hedge our risk, predominantly using call options on the S&P 500 Index, and replicate the market index returns to our policyholders. The majority of our products contain provisions that permit us to annually adjust the formula by which index credits are provided in response to changing market conditions. In addition, our annuity contracts generally either cannot be surrendered or include surrender charges that discourage early redemptions.

Our Strategy 
We will seek to grow our business by pursuing a set of strategies aimed at delivering sustainable and profitable growth for shareholders; including: 

• | Protect Sales in Our Existing Market. We believe the demand for retirement and principal protection products in the IMO market will continue even under the Department of Labor "fiduciary" rule standards. Our focus will be on reconfiguring products and capabilities and partnering with the IMOs to successfully compete in the heightened regulatory environment. 


• | Strengthen the Foundation. We will execute foundational initiatives that strengthen the business and provide a platform for sustainable growth. 


• | Enhance the FGL Experience. Building off the foundational initiatives, we will create a more engaging, customer-focused experience through accelerating the use of digital and improving the ease of doing business for our IMO partners and customers. 


• | Leverage Product Capabilities for Additional Distribution. Capitalize on our manufacturing expertise and distribution partnerships to expand product reach. 


• | Bottom-line, Profit-oriented Objectives. We focus on initiatives that we expect will deliver target profits and avoid markets and products when industry pricing makes it difficult to achieve targeted profit margins.

Competition 
Our ability to compete is dependent upon many factors which include, among other things, our ability to develop competitive and profitable products, our ability to maintain stable relationships with our contracted IMOs, our ability to maintain low unit costs and our maintenance of adequate financial strength ratings from rating agencies. Principal competitive factors for FIAs are initial crediting rates, reputation for renewal crediting action, product features, brand recognition, customer service, cost, distribution capabilities and financial strength ratings of the provider. Competition may affect, among other matters, both business growth and the pricing of our products and services. Principal competitive factors for IULs are based on service and distribution channel relationships, price, brand recognition, financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and financial stability.
For detailed information about revenues, operating income and total assets of our Company, see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the financial statements beginning on page F-1 in this report.
Products 
Our experience designing and developing annuities and life insurance products will allow us to continue to introduce innovative products and solutions designed to meet customers’ changing needs. We work hand-in-hand with our distributors to devise the most suitable product solutions for the ever-changing market. We believe that, on a practical basis, we have a unique understanding of the safety, accumulation, protection, and income needs of middle-income Americans. 
Annuity Products 
Through our insurance subsidiaries, we issue a broad portfolio of deferred annuities (fixed indexed and fixed rate annuities) and immediate annuities. A deferred annuity is a type of contract that accumulates value on a tax deferred basis and typically begins making specified periodic or lump sum payments a certain number of years after the contract has been issued. An immediate annuity is a type of contract that begins making specified payments within one annuity period (e.g., one month or one year) and typically pays principal and earnings in equal payments over some period of time. 
Deferred Annuities 
FIAs. Our FIAs allow contract owners the possibility of earning interest based on the performance of a specified market index, predominantly the S&P 500 Index, without risk to principal. The contracts include a provision for a minimum guaranteed surrender value calculated in accordance with applicable law. A market index tracks the performance of a specific group of stocks representing a particular segment of the market, or in some cases an entire market. For example, the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index is an index of 500 stocks intended 
8

to be representative of a broad segment of the market. All FIA products allow policyholders to allocate funds once a year among several different crediting strategies, including one or more index-based strategies and a traditional fixed rate strategy. High surrender charges apply for early withdrawal, typically for seven to fourteen years after purchase.
The value to the contractholder of an FIA contract is equal to the sum of deposits paid, premium bonuses (described below), index credits, up to a cap and a participation rate based on the annual appreciation (based in certain situations on annual point-to-point, monthly point-to-point or monthly average calculations) in a recognized market index less any fees for riders. Caps generally range from 2% to 6% when measured annually and 1% to 3% when measured monthly, and participation rates generally range from 30% to 100% of the performance of the applicable market index. The cap and participation rate can be reset annually. Certain riders allow for a contractholder to increase their cap for a set fee. As this fee is fixed, the contractholder may lose principal if the index credits received do not exceed the amount of such fee. 
Approximately 88% of the FIA sales for Fiscal 2017 involved “premium bonuses” or vesting bonuses. For premium bonuses, we increased the initial annuity deposit by a specified premium bonus of 2% to 4%. The vesting bonuses, which range from 1% to 9%, are earned over time and increase the account value when the bonus is settled. We made compensating adjustments in the commission paid to the agent or the surrender charges on the policy to offset the premium bonus. 
As of September 30, 2017, 86% of our FIA contracts were issued with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) rider. With this rider, a contract owner can elect to receive guaranteed payments for life from the FIA contract without requiring the owner to annuitize the FIA contract value. The amount of the living income benefit available is determined by the growth in the policy's benefit base value as defined in the FIA contract rider. Typically this accumulates for 10 years based on a guaranteed rate of 3% to 7%. Guaranteed withdrawal payments may be stopped and restarted at the election of the contract owner. Some of the FIA contract riders that we offer include an additional death benefit or an increase in benefit amounts under chronic health conditions. Rider fees range from 0% to 1%.
As of September 30, 2017, the distribution of the FIA account values by cap rate and by strategy was as follows: 

Cap rate | 0% to 3% | | 3% to 5% | | > 5% | | Total
1 year gain trigger | $ | 443 | | | $ | 206 | | $ | 40 | $ | 689 
1-2 year monthly average | 613 | | | 735 | | | 123 | | 1,471

1-3 year annual point-to-point | 1,560 | | | 1,647 | | | 362 | | 3,569
3 year step forward | — | | | 27 | | | 119 | | 146 
Total | $ | 7,030 | | | $ | 2,702 | | $ | 644 | $ | 10,376

Fixed Rate Annuities. Fixed rate annuities include annual reset and multi-year rate guaranteed policies. Fixed rate annual reset annuities issued by us have an annual interest rate (the “crediting rate”) that is guaranteed for the first policy year. After the first policy year, we have the discretionary ability to change the crediting rate once annually to any rate at or above a guaranteed minimum rate. Fixed rate multi-year guaranteed annuities are similar to fixed rate annual reset annuities except that the initial crediting rate is guaranteed for a specified number of years before it may be changed at our discretion. For Fiscal 2017, we sold $546 of fixed rate multi-year guaranteed annuities. As of September 30, 2017, crediting rates on outstanding (i) single-year guaranteed annuities generally ranged from 2% to 6% and (ii) multi-year guaranteed annuities ranged from 1% to 6%. The average crediting rate on all outstanding fixed rate annuities at September 30, 2017, was 3%.
As of September 30, 2017, the distribution of the fixed rate annuity account values by crediting rate was as follows: 

Crediting rate | 1% to 2% | | 2% to 3% | 3% to 4% | | 4% to 5% | 5% to 6% | | Total
Account value | $ | 39 | | $ | 176 | | $ | 3,213 | | $ | 373 | $ | 42 | $ | 3,843

As of September 30, 2017, the multi-year guaranteed annuities expiring guaranty account values, net of reinsurance by year were as follows:

 | Multi-Year Rate Guaranteed Annuities
Duration by Fiscal Year: | Account Value 
2018 | $ | 298 
2019 | 767 | 
2020 | 220 | 
2021 | 572 | 
2022 | 996 | 
Thereafter | 91 | 
Total | $ | 2,944

Withdrawal Options for Deferred Annuities. After the first year following the issuance of a FIA deferred annuity policy, holders of deferred annuities are typically permitted penalty-free withdrawals up to 10% of the prior year’s value, subject to certain limitations. Withdrawals in excess of allowable penalty-free amounts are assessed a surrender charge if such withdrawals are made during the penalty period of the deferred annuity policy. The penalty period typically ranges from seven to fourteen years for FIAs and three to ten years for fixed rate annuities. This surrender charge initially ranges from 0% to 15% of the contract value for FIAs and 0% to 12% of the contract value for fixed rate annuities and generally decreases by approximately one to two percentage points per year during the penalty period. The average surrender charge is 8% for our FIAs and 6% for our fixed rate annuities as of September 30, 2017. 
The following table summarizes our deferred annuity account values and surrender charge protection as of September 30, 2017: 

 | Fixed and Fixed Index Annuities Account Value | | Percent of Total | | Weighted Average Surrender Charge
SURRENDER CHARGE EXPIRATION BY YEAR | | | | | 
Out of surrender charge | $ | 2,605 | | | 16 | % | | — | %
2017 | 197 | | | 1 | % | | 5 | %
2018 - 2019 | 2,194 | | | 13 | % | | 5 | %
2020 - 2021 | 1,912 | | | 11 | % | | 7 | %
2022 - 2023 | 2,181 | | | 13 | % | | 8 | %
Thereafter | 7,730 | | | 46 | % | | 11 | %
Total | $ | 16,819 | | | 100 | % | | 

The policyholder may elect to take the proceeds of the surrender either in a single payment or in a series of payments over the life of the policyholder or for a fixed number of years (or a combination of these payment options). In addition to the foregoing withdrawal rights, policyholders may also elect to have additional withdrawal rights by purchasing a GMWB. These riders provide a GMWB, regardless of index performance, for the life of the contract. However, the benefit may vary based on performance.
Immediate Annuities 
We also sell single premium immediate annuities (or “SPIAs”), which provide a series of periodic payments for a fixed period of time or for the life of the policyholder, according to the policyholder’s choice at the time of issue. The amounts, frequency and length of time of the payments are fixed at the outset of the annuity contract. SPIAs are often purchased by persons at or near retirement age who desire a steady stream of payments over a future period of years.

Life Insurance 
We currently offer IUL insurance policies and have previously sold term and whole life insurance products. Holders of universal life insurance policies earn returns on their policies which are credited to the policyholder’s cash value account. The insurer periodically deducts its expenses and the cost of life insurance protection from the cash value account. The balance of the cash value account is credited interest at a fixed rate or returns based on the performance of a market index, or both, at the option of the policyholder, using a method similar to that described above for FIAs. 
Almost all of the life insurance policies in force, except for the return of premium benefits on term life insurance products, are subject to an arrangement with Wilton Reassurance Company (“Wilton Re”). See “Reinsurance-Wilton Re Transaction” on page 16. 
As of September 30, 2017, the distribution of the retained IUL account values by cap rate and by strategy was as follows: 

Cap rate | 2.5%-5.0% | | 5.0-7.5% | | 7.5%-10.0% | | 10.0-12.5% | 12.5+ | | Total

Distribution 
The sale of our products typically occurs as part of a four-party, three stage sales process between FGL Insurance, an IMO, the agent and the customer. FGL Insurance designs, manufactures, issues, and services the product. The IMOs will usually sign contracts with multiple insurance carriers to provide their agents with a broad and competitive product portfolio. The IMO will discuss product options over the phone with agents about to meet with clients. The IMO staff will also provide assistance to the agent during the selling and application process. The agent may get customer leads from the IMOs. The agent will conduct a fact find and present suitable product choices to the customers. We monitor each distribution partner for pricing metrics, mortality, persistency, as well as market conduct and suitability. 
Within this business model, we offer our products through a network of approximately 200 IMOs, representing approximately 37,000 agents, and identify our most important IMOs - - those who we believe have the ability to generate significant production for the Company - as “Power Partners”. We currently have 32 Power Partners, comprised of 21 annuity IMOs and 11 life insurance IMOs. During Fiscal 2017, these Power Partners accounted for approximately 95% of our annual sales volume. We believe that our relationships with these IMOs are strong. The average tenure of the top ten Power Partners is approximately 14 years. 
11

Our Power Partners play an important role in the development of our products. Over the last ten years, the majority of our best-selling products have been developed with our Power Partners. We intend to continue to have the Power Partners play an important role in the development of our products in the future, which we believe provides us with integral feedback throughout the development process and assists us with competing for “shelf space” of new design launches. 

The top five states for the distribution of FGL Insurance’s products in 2017 were California, Florida, Texas, Michigan and New Jersey, which together accounted for 43% of FGL Insurance’s premiums. 
Investments 
We embrace a long-term conservative investment philosophy, investing nearly all the insurance premiums we receive in a wide range of fixed income interest-bearing securities. 
Our internal asset management team manages the bulk of the investment portfolio. For certain asset classes, we utilize experienced third party companies, including our affiliates. As of September 30, 2017, 80% of our $21 billion fixed maturity investment portfolio was managed by our employees, with the 20% balance managed by third parties. Our investment strategy is designed to (i) achieve strong absolute returns, (ii) provide consistent yield and investment income, and (iii) preserve capital. We base all of our decisions on fundamental, bottom-up research, coupled with a top-down view that respects the cyclicality of certain asset classes. 
In addition to active management of assets, our Investments department is also responsible for defining portfolio strategy, managing our asset/liability profile and hedging our product guarantees. 
The types of assets in which we may invest are influenced by various state laws, which prescribe qualified investment assets applicable to insurance companies. Additionally, we define risk tolerance across a wide range of factors, including credit risk, liquidity risk, concentration (issuer and sector) risk, and caps on specific asset classes, which in turn establish conservative risk thresholds.
Our investment portfolio consists of high quality fixed maturities, including publicly issued and privately issued corporate bonds, municipal and other government bonds, asset-backed securities ("ABS"), residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS"), commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") and commercial mortgage loans ("CMLs"). We also maintain holdings in floating rate, and less rate-sensitive investments, including senior tranches of collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), non-agency RMBS, and various types of ABS. It is our expectation that our investment portfolio will broaden in scope and diversity to include other asset classes held by life and annuity insurance writers. We also have a small amount of equity holdings through our funding arrangement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. 
Portfolio Activity 
Over the last year, we continued to work with our internal asset management team and third party asset managers to broaden the portfolio’s exposure to include United States dollar ("USD") denominated emerging market bonds, highly rated preferred stocks and hybrids, and structured securities including ABS. 
As a result of these portfolio repositionings, we currently maintain: 

• | a well matched asset/liability profile (asset duration, including cash and cash equivalents, of 6.78 years vs. liability duration of 6.76 years); and


• | a large exposure to less rate-sensitive assets (18% of invested assets).

For further discussion of portfolio activity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investment Portfolio”. 
Derivatives 
Our FIA contracts permit the holder to elect to receive a return based on an interest rate or the performance of a market index, most typically based on the S&P 500 Index. We purchase derivatives consisting predominantly of call options and, to a lesser degree, futures contracts on the equity indices underlying the applicable policy. These derivatives are used to fund the index credits due to policyholders under the FIA contracts based upon policyholders' contract elections. The majority of all such call options are one-year options purchased to match the funding requirements underlying the FIA contracts. On the anniversary dates of the FIA contracts, the market 
12

index used to compute the annual index credit under the FIA contract is reset. At such time, we purchase new one-, two-, three-, or five-year call options to fund the next index credit. We manage the cost of these purchases through the terms of our FIA contracts, which permit us to change caps or participation rates, subject to certain guaranteed minimums that must be maintained. The change in the fair value of the call options and futures contracts is generally designed to offset the equity market related change in the fair value of the FIA contract’s related reserve liability. The call options and futures contracts are marked to fair value with the change in fair value included as a component of Net investment gains (losses). The change in fair value of the call options and futures contracts includes the gains and losses recognized at the expiration of the instruments’ terms or upon early termination and the changes in fair value of open positions. 
Outsourcing 
We outsource the following functions to third-party service providers: 

• | new business administration (date entry and policy issue only);


• | service of existing policies;


• | underwriting administration of life insurance applications;


• | call centers;


• | information technology development and maintenance;


• | investment accounting and custody; and


• | hosting of financial systems.

We closely manage our outsourcing partners and integrate their services into our operations. We believe that outsourcing such functions allows us to focus capital and FGL employees on our core business operations and perform differentiating functions, such as investment, actuarial, product development and risk management functions. In addition, we believe an outsourcing model provides predictable pricing, service levels and volume capabilities and allows us to benefit from technological developments that enhance our customer self-service and sales processes. 
We outsource our new business and existing policy administration for annuity and life products to Transaction Applications Group, Inc. Under this arrangement, Transaction Applications Group, Inc. manages most of our call center and processing requirements. Our current agreement expires on December 31, 2021. Additionally, in August 2017, we partnered with Concentrix to administer a portion of our annuity new business processing and the servicing of these issued annuity contracts (administration and call center activities).
We have partnered with CRL-Plus (“CRL-Plus”) to implement our life insurance underwriting policies. Under the terms of the arrangement, CRL-Plus has assigned FGL a dedicated team of underwriters with appropriate professional designations and experience. Underwriting guidelines for each product are established by our Chief Underwriter in collaboration with our actuarial department. Our Chief Underwriter and actuarial department work closely with the applicable reinsurance company to establish or change guidelines. Adherence to underwriting guidelines is managed at a case level through monthly underwriting audits conducted by our Chief Underwriter as well as the CRL-Plus lead underwriter. Periodically, underwriting audits are conducted by our reinsurers. Our current agreement with CRL-Plus is reviewed annually. We believe that we have a good relationship with our principal outsource service providers. 
Ratings 
Our access to funding and our related cost of borrowing, the attractiveness of certain of our products to customers and requirements for derivatives collateral posting are affected by our credit ratings and insurance financial strength ratings, which are periodically reviewed by the rating agencies. Financial strength ratings and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products.
As of September 30, 2017, A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best"), Fitch Ratings ("Fitch"), Moody’s Investors Service ("Moody's") and S&P Global Ratings ("S&P") issued financial strength credit and/or ratings and outlook statements regarding FGLH and its wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries, FGL Insurance and Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company of New York (“FGL NY Insurance”), as listed below. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity’s ability to repay its indebtedness. Financial strength ratings represent the 
13

opinions of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to meet its financial obligations under an insurance policy and generally involve quantitative and qualitative evaluations by rating agencies of a company’s financial condition and operating performance. Generally, rating agencies base their financial strength ratings upon information furnished to them by the insurer and upon their own investigations, studies and assumptions. Financial strength ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Credit and financial strength ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization. 
In addition to the financial strength ratings, rating agencies use an “outlook statement” to indicate a medium or long term trend which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. A positive outlook indicates a rating may be raised and a negative outlook indicates a rating may be lowered. A stable outlook is assigned when ratings are not likely to be changed. A developing outlook is assigned when a rating may be raised, lowered, or affirmed. Outlooks should not be confused with expected stability of the issuer’s financial or economic performance. A rating may have a "stable" outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change, but a "stable" outlook does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice.
Following the announcement of the CF Corp Merger Agreement on May 24, 2017, the rating organizations have undertaken a review of our debt ratings and our insurance company subsidiaries’ financial strength ratings. The rating organizations may take various actions, positive or negative. Such actions are beyond FGL's control and FGL cannot predict what these actions may be and the timing thereof.

A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P review their ratings of insurance companies from time to time. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will continue for any given period of time or that it will not be changed or withdrawn entirely if, in their judgment, circumstances so warrant. While the degree to which ratings adjustments will affect sales and persistency is unknown, we believe if our ratings were to be negatively adjusted for any reason, we could experience a material decline in the sales of our products and the persistency of our existing business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.

Potential Impact of a Ratings Downgrade 
Under some International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ("ISDA") agreements, we have agreed to maintain certain financial strength ratings. A downgrade below these levels provides the counterparty under the agreement the right to terminate the open derivative contracts between the parties, at which time any amounts payable by us or the counterparty would be dependent on the market value of the underlying derivative contracts. 
14

Our current rating allows multiple counterparties the right to terminate ISDA agreements, at which time the counterparty would unwind existing positions for fair market value. No ISDA agreements have been terminated, although the counterparties have reserved the right to terminate the ISDA agreements at any time. As of September 30, 2017, the amount due to the Company at risk for ISDA agreements which could be terminated based upon our current ratings was $413, which equals the fair value to us of the open over-the-counter call option positions. The fair value of the call options can never decrease below zero. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Credit Risk and Counterparty Risk”. 
In certain transactions, we and the counterparty have entered into a collateral support agreement requiring either party to post collateral when the net exposures exceed predetermined thresholds. These thresholds vary by counterparty and credit rating, however are generally zero. As of September 30, 2017 and 2016, $381 and $128, respectively, of collateral was posted by our counterparties. Accordingly, the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that we would incur if parties to the call options failed completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts was $32 and $148 at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
If the insurance subsidiaries held net short positions against a counterparty, and the subsidiaries’ financial strength ratings were below the levels required in the ISDA agreement with the counterparty, the counterparty would demand immediate further collateralization which could negatively impact overall liquidity. Based on the market value of our derivatives as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, we hold no net short positions against a counterparty; therefore, there is currently no potential exposure for us to post collateral. 
A downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products, as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings. A downgrade of the financial strength rating could also impact the Company's borrowing costs.
Risk Management 
Risk management is a critical part of our business. We seek to assess risk to our business through a formalized process involving (i) identifying short-term and long-term strategic and operational objectives, (ii) development of risk appetite statements that establish what the company is willing to accept in terms of risks to achieving its goals and objectives, (iii) identifying the levers that control the risk appetite of the company, (iv) establishing the overall limits of risk acceptable for a given risk driver, (v) establishing operational risk limits that are aligned with the tolerances, (vi) assigning risk limit quantification and mitigation responsibilities to individual team members within functional groups, (vii) analyzing the potential qualitative and quantitative impact of individual risks, including but not limited to stress and scenario testing covering over 8 economic and insurance related risks, (viii) mitigating risks by appropriate actions and (ix) identifying, documenting and communicating key business risks in a timely fashion. 
The responsibility for monitoring, evaluating and responding to risk is assigned first to our management and employees, second to those occupying specialist functions, such as legal compliance and risk teams, and third to those occupying supervisory functions, such as internal audit and the board of directors. 
In compliance with the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (ORSA), FGL Insurance submitted an ORSA report to the state regulators in November 2017 to provide risk management transparency and insight in the financial strength and long-term sustainability of the Companies. 
 Reinsurance 
FGL both cedes reinsurance and assumes reinsurance from other insurance companies. We use reinsurance to diversify risks, manage loss exposures, to enhance our capital position, and to manage new business volume.
In instances where we are the ceding company, we pay a premium to a reinsurer in exchange for the reinsurer assuming a portion of our liabilities under the policies we issued and collect expense allowances in return for our administration of the ceded policies. Use of reinsurance does not discharge our liability as the ceding company because we remain directly liable to our policyholders and are required to pay the full amount of our policy obligations in the event that our reinsurers fail to satisfy their obligations. We collect reimbursement from our reinsurers when we pay claims on policies that are reinsured. In instances where we assume reinsurance from another insurance company, we accept, in exchange for a reinsurance premium, a portion of the liabilities of the other insurance company under the policies that the ceding company has issued to its policyholders. 
15

We monitor the credit risk related to the ability of our reinsurers to honor their obligations under various agreements. To minimize the risk of credit loss on such contracts, we generally diversify our exposures among many reinsurers and limit the amount of exposure to each based on financial strength ratings, which are reviewed at least quarterly. We are able to further manage risk via funds withheld arrangements.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of reinsurance credit risk.
Wilton Re Transaction 
On January 26, 2011, FGL entered into an agreement (the “Commitment Agreement”) with Wilton Re U.S. Holdings, Inc. (“Wilton”), pursuant to which Wilton agreed to cause Wilton Re, its wholly-owned subsidiary, to enter into certain coinsurance arrangements with FGL Insurance following the closing of the FGLH Acquisition. Pursuant to the Commitment Agreement, Wilton Re has reinsured a 100% quota share of certain of FGL Insurance’s policies that are subject to redundant reserves under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX, as well as another block of FGL Insurance’s in-force traditional, and IUL insurance policies. 
Wilton Re’s reinsurance of such FGL Insurance policies has not extinguished FGL Insurance’s liability with respect to such business because FGL Insurance remains directly liable to policyholders and is required to pay the full amount of its policy obligations in the event that Wilton Re fails to satisfy its obligations with respect to the reinsured business. 
The Front Street Reinsurance Transactions 
On December 31, 2012, following regulatory approval, FGL Insurance entered into a coinsurance agreement (the “Cayman Reinsurance Agreement”) with FSRCI, at the time, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of FGL. Pursuant to the Cayman Reinsurance Agreement, FSRCI reinsured a 10% quota share percentage of certain FGL Insurance annuity liabilities of approximately $1 billion and the funds withheld assets are $1 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, FSRCI paid an initial ceding allowance of $15 which was determined to be fair and reasonable according to an independent third-party actuarial firm. The coinsurance agreement is on a funds withheld basis, meaning that funds are withheld by FGL Insurance from the coinsurance premium owed to FSRCI as collateral for FSRCI’s payment obligations. Accordingly, the collateral assets remain under the ultimate ownership of FGL Insurance. See "Note 13. Reinsurance" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2017, ceded reserves are $1 billion.
Effective September 17, 2014, FGL Insurance entered into a second reinsurance treaty with FSRCI whereby FGL Insurance ceded 30% of any new business of its multi-year guaranteed annuity ("MYGA") block of business on a funds withheld basis. This treaty was subsequently terminated as to new business effective April 30, 2015, but will remain in effect for policies ceded to FSRCI with an effective date between September 17, 2014 and April 30, 2015.
Hannover Reinsurance Transaction
Effective January 1, 2017, the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement with Hannover Re, a third party reinsurer,  to reinsure an inforce block of its FIA and fixed deferred annuity contracts with  Guaranteed Minimum Withdraw Benefit (“GMWB”) and Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (“GMDB”) secondary guarantees.  In accordance with the terms of this agreement, the Company cedes 70% net retention of secondary guarantee payments in excess of account value for GMWB and GMDB guarantees. Effective July 1, 2017, the Company extended this agreement to include new business issued during 2017. 
Reserve Facilities 
Life insurance companies operating in the United States must calculate required reserves for life and annuity policies based on statutory principles. These methodologies are governed by “Regulation XXX” (applicable to term life insurance policies), “Guideline AXXX” (applicable to universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees) and the Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method, known as “CARVM” (applicable to annuities). Under Regulation XXX, Guideline AXXX and CARVM, insurers are required to establish statutory reserves for such policies that exceed economic reserves. The industry has reduced or eliminated redundancies thereby increasing capital using a variety of techniques including reserve facilities.
The CARVM Facility. On October 5, 2012, FGL Insurance entered into a yearly renewable term indemnity reinsurance agreement with Raven Reinsurance Company ("Raven Re"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FGL 
16

Insurance (the “Raven Reinsurance Agreement”), pursuant to which FGL Insurance ceded a 100% quota share of its CARVM liability for annuity benefits where surrender charges are waived. To collateralize its obligations under the Raven Reinsurance Agreement, Raven Re entered into a reimbursement agreement with Nomura Bank International plc (“NBI”), an affiliate of Nomura Securities International, Inc., and FGL (the “Reimbursement Agreement”) whereby a subsidiary of NBI issued trust notes and NBI issued a $295 letter of credit that, in each case, were deposited into a reinsurance trust as collateral for Raven Re’s obligations under the Raven Reinsurance Agreement (the “NBI Facility”). Pursuant to the NBI Facility, FGL Insurance takes full credit on its statutory financial statements for the CARVM reserve ceded to Raven Re. The letter of credit facility automatically reduces each calendar quarter by $6. As of September 30, 2017, there was $115 available under the letter of credit facility. Under the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement, in the event the letter of credit is drawn upon, Raven Re is required to repay the amounts utilized, and FGLH is obligated to repay the amounts utilized if Raven Re fails to make the required reimbursement. FGLH also is required to make capital contributions to Raven Re in the event that Raven Re’s statutory capital and surplus falls below certain defined levels. As of December 31, 2016, Raven Re’s statutory capital and surplus was $24 in excess of the minimum level required under the Reimbursement Agreement. 
Effective April, 1 2017, FGL Insurance and Raven Re amended the reinsurance treaty and related trust and letter of credit agreements to extend the term of the letter of credit which would have matured on September 30, 2017. The amendments added additional in-force business to the reinsurance treaty (fixed indexed annuities without a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider and multi-year guarantee annuities (“MYGA”) issued between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016). No initial ceding commission was paid or received by FGL Insurance or Raven Re in connection with the cession of additional in-force business. No assets were transferred to or from FGL Insurance or Raven Re in connection with the cession of additional in-force business. The amendments extended the letter of credit for an additional five year period and reduced the face amount of the letter of credit at April 1, 2017 from $183 to $115. The facility may terminate earlier in accordance with the Reimbursement Agreement.
See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Credit Risk and Counterparty Risk”. 
Regulation 
Overview 
FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision in their domiciles, Iowa, New York and Vermont, respectively, and in each state in which they do business. FGL Insurance does business throughout the United States, except for New York. FGL NY Insurance only does business in New York. Raven Re is a special purpose captive reinsurance company that only provides reinsurance to FGL Insurance under the CARVM Treaty. Following its redomestication to Iowa, FGL Insurance’s principal insurance regulatory authority is the IID. State insurance departments throughout the United States also monitor FGL Insurance’s insurance operations as a licensed insurer. The New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) regulates the operations of FGL NY Insurance, which is domiciled and licensed in New York. The purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect policyholders and beneficiaries and not general creditors and shareholders of those insurers. Many of the laws and regulations to which FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance are subject are regularly re-examined and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect their operations. 
Generally, insurance products underwritten by and rates used by FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance must be approved by the insurance regulators in each state in which they are sold. Those products are also substantially affected by federal and state tax laws. For example, changes in tax law could reduce or eliminate the tax-deferred accumulation of earnings on the deposits paid by the holders of annuities and life insurance products, which could make such products less attractive to potential purchasers. A shift away from life insurance and annuity products could reduce FGL Insurance’s and FGL NY Insurance’s income from the sale of such products, as well as the assets upon which FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance earn investment income. In addition, insurance products may also be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"). 
State insurance authorities have broad administrative powers over FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including: 

• | licensing to transact business;

17


• | licensing agents;


• | prescribing which assets and liabilities are to be considered in determining statutory surplus;


• | regulating premium rates for certain insurance products;


• | approving policy forms and certain related materials;


• | determining whether a reasonable basis exists as to the suitability of the annuity purchase recommendations producers make;


• | regulating unfair trade and claims practices;


• | establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards;


• | regulating the amount of dividends that may be paid in any year;


• | regulating the availability of reinsurance or other substitute financing solutions, the terms thereof and the ability of an insurer to take credit on its financial statements for insurance ceded to reinsurers or other substitute financing solutions;


•


• | fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values; and


• | regulating the type, amounts, and valuations of investments permitted, transactions with affiliates, and other matters.

Financial Regulation 
State insurance laws and regulations require FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re to file reports, including financial statements, with state insurance departments in each state in which they do business, and their operations and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments. 
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has approved a series of statutory accounting principles and various model regulations that have been adopted, in some cases with certain modifications, by all state insurance departments. These statutory principles are subject to ongoing change and modification. For instance, the NAIC adopted, effective with the annual reporting period ending December 31, 2010, revisions to the Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation (or the Model Audit Rule) related to auditor independence, corporate governance and internal control over financial reporting. These revisions require that insurance companies, such as FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance, file reports with state insurance departments regarding their assessments of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, compliance with any particular regulator’s interpretation of a legal or accounting issue may not result in compliance with another regulator’s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. Any particular regulator’s interpretation of a legal or accounting issue may change over time to FGL Insurance’s or FGL NY Insurance’s detriment, or changes to the overall legal or market environment, even absent any change of interpretation by a particular regulator, may cause FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance to change their views regarding the actions they need to take from a legal risk management perspective, which could necessitate changes to FGL Insurance’s or FGL NY Insurance’s practices that may, in some cases, limit their ability to grow and improve profitability. 
State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy and rate filings, market conduct and business practices of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. State insurance departments also have the authority to conduct examinations of non-domiciliary insurers that are licensed in their states. The Maryland Insurance Administration (“MIA”) completed a routine financial examination of FGL Insurance for the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, and found no material deficiencies and proposed no adjustments to the financial statements as filed. The NYDFS completed a routine financial examination of FGL NY for the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, and found no material deficiencies and proposed no adjustments to the financial statements as filed. The NYDFS is in the process of completing a routine financial examination of FGL NY Insurance for the three-year periods ended December 31, 2012.
18

The Vermont Department of Financial Regulation has completed a routine financial examination of Raven Re for the period from April 7, 2011 (commencement of business) through December 31, 2012. It found no material deficiencies and proposed no adjustments to the financial statements as filed. 
Going forward, FGL Insurance will be subject to financial and market conduct examinations by the IID, the primary regulatory authority for Iowa domestic life insurance companies. 
Dividend and Other Distribution Payment Limitations 
The Iowa insurance law and the New York insurance law regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid in any year by FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance, respectively. Each year, FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance may pay a certain limited amount of ordinary dividends or other distributions without being required to obtain the prior consent of the Iowa Insurance Commissioner (“Iowa Commissioner”) or the NYDFS, respectively. However, to pay any dividends or distributions (including the payment of any dividends or distributions for which prior consent is not required), FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance must provide advance written notice to the Iowa Commissioner or the NYDFS, respectively. 
Pursuant to Iowa insurance law, ordinary dividends are payments, together with all other such payments within the preceding twelve months, that do not exceed the greater of (i) 10% of FGL Insurance’s statutory surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the preceding year; or (ii) the net gain from operations of FGL Insurance (excluding realized capital gains) for the 12-month period ending December 31 of the preceding year. 
Dividends in excess of FGL Insurance’s ordinary dividend capacity are referred to as extraordinary and require prior approval of the Iowa Commissioner. In deciding whether to approve a request to pay an extraordinary dividend, Iowa insurance law requires the Iowa Commissioner to consider the effect of the dividend payment on FGL Insurance’s surplus and financial condition generally and whether the payment of the dividend will cause FGL Insurance to fail to meet its required RBC ratio. Dividends may only be paid out of statutory earned surplus. 
In recent calendar years, FGL Insurance has had the dividend capacity and paid dividends to us as set forth in this table: 

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013
FGL Insurance ordinary dividend capacity | $ | 132 | | | $ | 124 | | $ | 121 | $ | 124 | $ | 106
FGL Insurance ordinary dividends paid | 25 | | | — | | | — | | — | 40 | 

Any payment of dividends by FGL Insurance is subject to the regulatory restrictions described above and the approval of such payment by the board of directors of FGL Insurance, which must consider various factors, including general economic and business conditions, tax considerations, FGL Insurance’s strategic plans, financial results and condition, FGL Insurance’s expansion plans, any contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends and its effect on RBC and such other factors the board of directors of FGL Insurance considers relevant. For example, payments of dividends could reduce FGL Insurance’s RBC and financial condition and lead to a reduction in FGL Insurance’s financial strength rating. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-A financial strength ratings downgrade, potential downgrade, or any other negative action by a rating agency could make our products less attractive and increase our cost of capital, and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations”. 
FGL NY Insurance has historically not paid dividends. In 2012, FGL NY Insurance paid a $4 dividend to FGL Insurance after a determination that, as a result of capital contributions by FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance was overcapitalized. 
 Surplus and Capital 
FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance are subject to the supervision of the regulators in states where they are licensed to transact business. Regulators have discretionary authority in connection with the continuing licensing of these entities to limit or prohibit sales to policyholders if, in their judgment, the regulators determine that such entities have not maintained the minimum surplus or capital or that the further transaction of business will be hazardous to policyholders. 
19

Risk-Based Capital 
In order to enhance the regulation of insurers’ solvency, the NAIC adopted a model law to implement RBC requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance companies. All states have adopted the NAIC’s model law or a substantially similar law. RBC is used to evaluate the adequacy of capital and surplus maintained by an insurance company in relation to risks associated with: (i) asset risk, (ii) insurance risk, (iii) interest rate risk, and (iv) business risk. In general, RBC is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium and reserve items, taking into account the risk characteristics of the insurer. Within a given risk category, these factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with lower underlying risk. The RBC formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. Insurers that have less statutory capital than the RBC calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy. As of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the RBC ratios for FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance each exceeded the minimum RBC requirements. 
It is desirable to maintain an RBC ratio in excess of the minimum requirements in order to maintain or improve our financial strength ratings. Our historical RBC ratios for FGL Insurance are presented in the table below. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-A financial strength ratings downgrade, potential downgrade, or any other negative action by a rating agency could make our product offerings less attractive and increase our cost of capital, and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations”. 

 | RBC Ratio 
As of: | 
December 31, 2016 | 412 | %
December 31, 2015 | 401 | %
December 31, 2014 | 388 | %
December 31, 2013 | 423 | %
December 31, 2012 | 406 | %

Insurance Regulatory Information System Tests 
The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS") to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or action by insurance regulatory authorities. A ratio falling outside the prescribed “usual range” is not considered a failing result. Rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. In many cases, it is not unusual for financially sound companies to have one or more ratios that fall outside the usual range. Insurance companies generally submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data using prescribed financial data ratios, each with defined “usual ranges”. Generally, regulators will begin to investigate or monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. IRIS consists of a statistical phase and an analytical phase whereby financial examiners review insurers’ annual statements and financial ratios. The statistical phase consists of 12 key financial ratios based on year-end data that are generated from the NAIC database annually; each ratio has a “usual range” of results. As of December 31, 2016, FGL Insurance had one ratio outside the usual range.  FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re each had two ratios outside the usual range.  The IRIS ratio for change in reserving for both FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance was outside the usual range.  The IRIS ratio for change in premium for both FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re was outside the usual range.  In addition, Raven Re’s IRIS ratio for adequacy of investment income also fell outside the usual range.
In all instances in prior years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required. FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re are not currently subject to regulatory restrictions based on these ratios. 
Insurance Reserves 
State insurance laws require insurers to analyze the adequacy of reserves. The respective appointed actuaries for FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re must each submit an opinion on an annual basis that their respective reserves, when considered in light of the respective assets FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for the contractual obligations and related expenses 
20

of FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re. FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re have filed all of the required opinions with the insurance departments in the states in which they do business. 
Credit for Reinsurance Regulation 
States regulate the extent to which insurers are permitted to take credit on their financial statements for the financial obligations that the insurers cede to reinsurers. Where an insurer cedes obligations to a reinsurer which is neither licensed nor accredited by the state insurance department, the ceding insurer is not permitted to take such financial statement credit unless the unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurer secures the liabilities it will owe under the reinsurance contract. Under the laws regulating credit for reinsurance issued by such unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurers, the permissible means of securing such liabilities are (i) the establishment of a trust account by the reinsurer to hold certain qualifying assets in a qualified U.S. financial institution, such as a member of the Federal Reserve, with the ceding insurer as the exclusive beneficiary of such trust account with the unconditional right to demand, without notice to the reinsurer, that the trustee pay over to it the assets in the trust account equal to the liabilities owed by the reinsurer; (ii) the posting of an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit by a qualified U.S. financial institution in favor of the ceding company allowing the ceding company to draw upon the letter of credit up to the amount of the unpaid liabilities of the reinsurer and (iii) a “funds withheld” arrangement by which the ceding company withholds transfer to the reinsurer of the reserves which support the liabilities to be owed by the reinsurer, with the ceding insurer retaining title to and exclusive control over such reserves. In addition, on January 1, 2014, the NAIC Model Credit for Reinsurance Act became effective in Iowa, which adds the concept of “certified reinsurer”, whereby a ceding insurer may take financial statement credit for reinsurance provided by an unaccredited and unlicensed reinsurer which has been certified by the Iowa Commissioner. The Iowa Commissioner certifies reinsurers based on several factors, including their financial strength ratings, and imposes collateral requirements based on such factors. FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance are subject to such credit for reinsurance rules in Iowa and New York, respectively, insofar as they enter into any reinsurance contracts with reinsurers which are neither licensed nor accredited in Iowa and New York, respectively. 
Insurance Holding Company Regulation 
As the parent company of FGL Insurance and the indirect parent company of FGL NY Insurance, we and entities affiliated for purposes of insurance regulation are subject to the insurance holding company laws in Iowa and New York. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system. Generally, all transactions between insurers and affiliates within the holding company system are subject to regulation and must be fair and reasonable, and may require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by its domiciliary insurance regulator. 
Most states, including Iowa and New York, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company. Such laws prevent any person from acquiring control, directly or indirectly, of HRG, FGL, FGLH, FGL Insurance or FGL NY Insurance unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval. In addition, investors deemed to have a direct or indirect controlling interest are required to make regulatory filings and respond to regulatory inquiries. Under most states’ statutes, including those of Iowa and New York, acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of our voting securities or that of HRG, FGL, FGLH, FGL Insurance or FGL NY Insurance without the prior approval of the insurance regulators of Iowa and New York will be in violation of those states’ laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the relevant insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of those securities and to other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator. 
Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments 
Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in the state may be assessed by state insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Typically, states assess each member insurer in an amount related to the member insurer’s proportionate share of the business written by all member insurers in the state. Although no prediction can be made as to the amount and timing of any future assessments under these laws, FGL Insurance and FGL NY 
21

Insurance have established reserves that they believe are adequate for assessments relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings. 
Market Conduct Regulation 
State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales and complaint process practices. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. In addition, FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance must file, and in many jurisdictions and for some lines of business obtain regulatory approval for, rates and forms relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which they operate. FGL Insurance is currently the subject of four ongoing market conduct examinations in various states. Market conduct examinations can result in monetary fines or remediation and generally require FGL Insurance to devote significant resources to the management of such examinations. FGL Insurance does not believe that any of the current market conduct examinations it is subject to will result in any fines or remediation orders that will be material to its business. 
Regulation of Investments 
FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed income securities, equity, real estate, other equity investments and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as either non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus or as not qualified as an asset held for reserve purposes and, in some instances, would require divestiture or replacement of such non-qualifying investments. We believe that the investment portfolios of FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance as of September 30, 2017 complied in all material respects with such regulations. 
Privacy Regulation 
Our operations are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations that require financial institutions and other businesses to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of such information. These laws and regulations require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement agencies, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers, and require holders of certain personal information to protect the security of the data. Our operations are also subject to certain federal regulations that require financial institutions and creditors to implement effective programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft. In addition, our ability to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers and our uses of certain personal information, including consumer report information, are regulated. Federal and state governments and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal information. 
FIAs 
In recent years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and state securities regulators have questioned whether FIAs, such as those sold by us, should be treated as securities under the federal and state securities laws rather than as insurance products exempted from such laws. Treatment of these products as securities would require additional registration and licensing of these products and the agents selling them, as well as cause us to seek additional marketing relationships for these products, any of which may impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct operations as currently operated. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, annuities that meet specific requirements, including requirements relating to certain state suitability rules, are specifically exempted from being treated as securities by the SEC. We expect that the types of FIAs FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance sell will meet these requirements and therefore are exempt from being treated as securities by the SEC and state securities regulators. However, there can be no assurance that federal or state securities laws or state insurance laws and regulations will not be amended or interpreted to impose further requirements on FIAs.

The Dodd-Frank Act 
The Dodd-Frank Act makes sweeping changes to the regulation of financial services entities, products and markets. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are or may become applicable to us, our competitors or those entities with which we do business, including, but not limited to: 

• | the establishment of federal regulatory authority over derivatives;


• | the establishment of consolidated federal regulation and resolution authority over systemically important financial services firms;


• | the establishment of the Federal Insurance Office;


• | changes to the regulation of broker dealers and investment advisors;


• | changes to the regulation of reinsurance;


• | changes to regulations affecting the rights of shareholders;


• | the imposition of additional regulation over credit rating agencies;


•


• | the imposition of concentration limits on financial institutions that restrict the amount of credit that may be extended to a single person or entity; and


• | the clearing of derivative contracts.

Numerous provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require the adoption of implementing rules or regulations, some of which have been implemented. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislation or regulation applicable to the insurance industry, us, our competitors or those entities with which we do business. Legislative or regulatory requirements imposed by or promulgated in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act may impact us in many ways, including, but not limited to: 

• | placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competition or other financial services entities;


• | changing the competitive landscape of the financial services sector or the insurance industry;


• | making it more expensive for us to conduct our business;


• | requiring the reallocation of significant company resources to government affairs;


• | increasing our legal and compliance related activities and the costs associated therewith; or


• | otherwise having a material adverse effect on the overall business climate as well as our financial condition and results of operations.

Until various studies are completed and final regulations are promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on investments, investment activities and insurance and annuity products of FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance remains unclear. 
ERISA 
We may offer certain insurance and annuity products to employee benefit plans governed by ERISA and/or the Code, including group annuity contracts designated to fund tax-qualified retirement plans. ERISA and the Code provide (among other requirements) standards of conduct for employee benefit plan fiduciaries, including investment managers and investment advisers with respect to the assets of such plans, and holds fiduciaries liable if they fail to satisfy fiduciary standards of conduct. 
In April 2016, the Department of Labor (“DOL”) issued the “fiduciary” rule which could have a material impact on the Company, its products, distribution, and business model. The rule provides that persons who render investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to an employer plan or individual retirement account ("IRA") are fiduciaries of that plan or IRA. The rule expands the definition of fiduciary under ERISA to apply to insurance agents who advise and sell products to IRA owners. As a result, commissioned insurance agents selling the Company’s IRA products must qualify for a prohibited transaction exemption, either the newly introduced Best Interest Contract Exemption (BICE) or amended PTE 84-24. When fully implemented, BICE would apply to fixed indexed annuities and amended PTE 84-24 would apply to fixed rate annuities. The rule and exemptions have been the subject of much controversy and various actions have been taken by DOL to delay and reconsider aspects of the rule and exemptions. The rule took effect June 2016 and was scheduled to become applicable in April 2017 but the “applicability date" was delayed by DOL for 60 days from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017. DOL also acted to delay many aspects of the prohibited transaction exemption requirements during a transition period from June 
23

9, 2017 to January 1, 2018 provided the agent (and if applicable, financial institution) comply with “impartial conduct standards.” The impartial conduct standards essentially require the sale to be in the “best interest” of the client, misleading statements not be made, and compensation be reasonable. More recently, DOL has proposed extending the transition period to July 1, 2019 which at the present time is still under consideration. Industry continues its efforts to overturn the rule in court actions and Congress continues to consider related legislation but the success or failure of these efforts cannot be predicted. Assuming the rule is not overturned and the requirements of the exemptions were to be implemented fully, the impact on the financial services industry generally and on the Company and its business in particular is difficult to assess. We believe however it could have an adverse effect on sales of annuity products to IRA owners particularly in the independent agent distribution channel. A significant portion of our annuity sales are to IRAs. Compliance with the prohibited transaction exemptions when fully phased in would likely require additional supervision of agents, cause changes to compensation practices and product offerings, and increase litigation risk, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. FGL Insurance will continue to monitor developments closely and believes it is prepared to execute implementation plans as necessary to meet the rule and exemption requirements on the requisite applicability dates.
Employees
As of September 30, 2017, we had 299 employees. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
