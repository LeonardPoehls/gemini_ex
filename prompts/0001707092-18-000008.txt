ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Delphi Technologies PLC (“Delphi Technologies,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is a leader in the development, design and manufacture of vehicle propulsion systems that optimize engine performance, increase vehicle efficiency, reduce emissions, improve driving performance, and support increasing electrification of vehicles. We are a global supplier to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) seeking to manufacture vehicles that meet and exceed increasingly stringent global regulatory requirements and satisfy consumer demands for an enhanced user experience. Additionally, we offer a full spectrum of aftermarket products serving a global customer base.
On December 4, 2017, Delphi Technologies became an independent publicly traded company as a result of the distribution by Delphi Automotive PLC (the “Former Parent”) of 100% of the ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies PLC to Delphi Automotive PLC’s shareholders (the “Separation”). Following the Separation, Delphi Automotive PLC changed its name to Aptiv PLC (“Aptiv”). The Company previously operated substantially as the Former Parent’s Powertrain Systems segment (references hereinafter to “Delphi Technologies,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” include the results of the Former Parent’s Powertrain Systems segment).
Our portfolio includes advanced gas and diesel fuel injection systems (“FIS”), actuators, valvetrain products, sensors, electronic control modules and power electronics technologies. We believe our ability to meet regulatory requirements for reduced emissions and increased fuel economy, as well as to provide additional power to support consumer-driven demand for more in-vehicle electronics, will allow us to realize revenue growth in excess of vehicle production growth.
Our comprehensive portfolio of advanced technologies and solutions for all propulsion systems are sold to global OEMs of both light vehicles (passenger cars, trucks, vans and sport-utility vehicles) and commercial vehicles (light-duty, medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks; commercial vans; buses and off-highway vehicles).

Our Industry
The automotive and commercial vehicle parts industry provides components, systems, subsystems and modules to OEMs for the manufacture of new vehicles, as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts. Overall, we expect long-term growth of global vehicle production in the OEM market. In 2017, global vehicle production (including light and commercial vehicles) increased 3% versus the previous year, including increases of 4% in Europe, 3% in China and 21% in South America. However, after several years of increases, consumer demand for vehicles in North America receded, resulting in a 4% year-over-year decrease in North American production in 2017.
Demand for automotive components in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment and other trends. In the commercial vehicle market, OEM demand for components is also tied to vehicle production and is driven by industrial production, the amount of freight tonnage being transported and the availability of credit and interest rates, among other factors. Although OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production, participants in the automotive and commercial vehicle parts industry also have the opportunity to grow faster by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets, gaining new customers and increasing presence in global markets. Above-market growth can be achieved through product alignment to favorable macro trends such as increasingly stringent regulations and growing consumer demand for electrification. The number of vehicles utilizing electrification is expected to grow to more than 30% of global vehicle production by 2025, as compared to just four percent today. As a global supplier with advanced technology, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities, we are well positioned to benefit from these opportunities.
Heightened Regulatory Environment

OEMs continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets. On a worldwide basis, the relevant authorities in the European Union, the United States (“U.S.”), China, India, Japan, Brazil, South Korea and Argentina have already instituted regulations requiring further reductions in emissions and/or increased fuel economy. In many cases, other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten standards through 2020 and beyond. Based on the current regulatory environment, we believe that OEMs, including those in the U.S. and China, will be required to reduce carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions over the next ten years. These standards will require meaningful innovation as OEMs and suppliers are forced to find ways to improve fuel injection and combustion efficiency, engine management, electrical power consumption, vehicle weight and integration of alternative powertrains (e.g., electric/hybrid propulsion). As a result, suppliers such as Delphi Technologies are continuing to develop innovations that result in improvements in fuel economy, emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine downsizing without loss of performance.
Standardization of Sourcing by OEMs
Many OEMs are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization, reduce per-unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. As a result, OEMs are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations. Suppliers with global scale and strong design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend. OEMs are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs. As a result, suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers have assumed many of the design, engineering, research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers. Suppliers that can provide fully-engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts, such as Delphi Technologies, are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing.
Shorter Product Development Cycles To Benefit Strong Suppliers
As a result of government regulations and customer preferences, development cycles are becoming shorter and OEMs are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations. While these trends are more prevalent in mature markets, emerging markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of more mature markets. Suppliers with strong technologies, global engineering and development capabilities, such as Delphi Technologies, will be best positioned to meet OEM demands for rapid innovation.

Increasing Vehicle Complexity
Vehicles are increasingly complex in their design, features, level of integration of mechanical and electrical components and increasing levels of software necessary to deliver their functionality. This has resulted in growing consumer demand for additional power, given the increasing level of electronic components and systems in vehicles. Electronics integration, which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits, software algorithms, sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle, will allow OEMs to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity. In turn, this results in enhanced fuel economy, improved emissions control and better vehicle performance. We are well positioned to benefit from accelerating industry demand for electronics integration and vehicle electrification. Moreover, our proprietary power electronics solutions allow our OEM customers to improve efficiency, reduce weight and lower costs.
Products
Our organizational structure and management reporting support the management of these core product lines:
Powertrain Systems. This segment offers high quality components and complete engine management systems to help optimize performance, emissions and fuel economy.
Internal Combustion Engine (“ICE”) Products:

• | Our gasoline FIS portfolio includes a full suite of fuel injection technologies that deliver greater efficiency for traditional and hybrid vehicles with gasoline combustion engines. Our Gasoline Direct Injection (“GDi”) technology provides high precision fuel delivery for optimized combustion, which lowers emissions and increases fuel economy.


• | Our diesel FIS portfolio provides enhanced engine performance at an attractive value. Common rail FIS is the core technology for both commercial and light vehicle applications.


• | The ICE products also include an array of highly engineered products for traditional combustion and hybrid electric vehicles, including variable valve timing, variable valve actuation, smart remote actuators, powertrain sensors, ignition products, canisters, and fuel handling products. These products often complement and enhance the efficiency improvements delivered by our FIS technologies and, as a result, drive above market growth.

Electronics & Electrification Products:

• | Our electronics portfolio consists of gasoline and diesel control modules, local control units and power electronics. The control modules are key components that enable the integration and operation of powertrain products throughout the vehicle. As the electrification of mechanical components increases, our proprietary solutions, including supervisory controllers and software, DC/DC converters and inverters provide better efficiency, reduced weight and lower cost for our OEM customers while also making these and other components easier to integrate. These products are expected to experience increased demand as vehicle electrification accelerates.

Delphi Technologies Aftermarket. Through this segment we sell aftermarket products and services to independent aftermarket customers and original equipment service customers. Our aftermarket product portfolio includes a wide range of solutions covering the fuel injection, electronics and engine management, maintenance, and test equipment and vehicle diagnostics categories. Our aftermarket business provides a recurring and stable revenue base as replacement of many of these products is non-discretionary in nature. The growth in the number of vehicles in all regions of the world, along with the increasing average age of vehicles and a greater number of miles driven annually in certain markets collectively represent trends that are expected to lead to growing demand for our aftermarket products.
Competition
The automotive parts industry remains extremely competitive in light of constantly evolving market dynamics. The industry in which we compete has attracted, and may continue to attract, new entrants in areas of evolving vehicle technologies. Although OEMs prefer to maintain relationships with suppliers that have a proven record of performance they rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality, price, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design capability, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, financial viability, application of lean principles, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. In addition, our customers generally require that we demonstrate 
8

improved efficiencies, through cost reductions and/or price improvements, on a year-over-year basis. Our primary competitors include Bosch Group, Continental AG, Denso Corporation, and Hitachi Ltd.
Customers
Our business is diversified across end-markets, regions, customers, vehicle platforms and products. We sell our products and services to the major global automotive and commercial vehicle OEMs in every region of the world. We also sell our products and services to the worldwide aftermarket for replacement parts, including the aftermarket operations of our OEM customers and to other distributors and retailers. Our global customer base includes 23 of the largest light vehicle OEMs, several of the largest commercial vehicle OEMs, and four of the top five largest automotive aftermarket retailers and wholesale distributors. Our ten largest platforms in 2017 were with nine different OEMs. In addition, in 2017 our solutions were found in the majority of the top twenty platforms in each of the regions in which we operate. Furthermore, 21% of our business is focused on the commercial vehicle market, which is typically on a different business cycle than the light vehicle market. Our revenue base is also geographically diverse, and in 2017, 27% of our net sales came from the Asia Pacific region, which we believe will be a key growth market driven by increasing levels of vehicle production and regulatory change. In addition, we had no customers with greater than 10% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Hyundai Motor Company and Daimler AG accounted for 11% and 10% of net sales, respectively.
Supply Relationships with Our Customers
We typically supply products to our OEM customers through purchase orders, which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each OEM. Although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer, they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. These relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle. Prices are negotiated with respect to each business award, which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances, such as commodity or foreign exchange escalation/de-escalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us. The terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied; in most cases, the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the OEM to the end-user of the vehicle. We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products.
Individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or non-performance and, in most cases, upon our insolvency and certain change of control events. In addition, many of our OEM customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs, which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program, potentially reducing our profit margins and increasing the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts. We manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules, normally provided on a weekly basis, which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels.
Although customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of OEM production during such future periods, customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders. Firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials, sub-components and work-in-process inventory for OEM orders and from current on-hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders. The dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved.

For a description of the risks associated with our global operations see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Materials
We procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world. Generally, we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs. As of December 31, 2017, we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules.
Commodity cost volatility, most notably related to various metals, is a challenge for us and our industry. As such, we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our material-related cost exposures using a number of approaches, including combining purchase requirements with customers and/or other suppliers, using alternate suppliers or product designs and negotiating cost reductions and/or commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts. Our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited. 
Research, Development and Intellectual Property
We maintain technical engineering centers in major regions of the world to develop and provide advanced products, processes and manufacturing support for all of our manufacturing sites, and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis. As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 5,000 scientists, engineers and technicians around the world. Our total research and development expenses, including engineering, net of customer reimbursements, were approximately $420 million, $424 million and $443 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We believe that our engineering and technical expertise, together with our emphasis on continuing research and development, allow us to use the latest technologies, materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new, innovative products to market. We believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products. Given our strong financial discipline, we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs, including investment in innovation and technology. We maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies.

We currently hold more than 3,100 active patents and patent applications. While no individual patent or group of patents, taken alone, is considered material to our business, taken in the aggregate, these patents provide meaningful protection for our 
10

products and technical innovations. We are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and non-automotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests. These activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights.
Environmental Compliance
We are subject to the requirements of environmental and safety and health laws and regulations in each country in which we operate. These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge, hazardous materials and waste management. We have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally. Although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations, we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material.
Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances. At this time, we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities. In addition, there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities.
At December 31, 2017, the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately $4 million. We cannot assure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Seasonality
Our business is moderately seasonal, as our primary North American customers historically reduce production during the month of July and halt operations for approximately one week in December. Our European customers generally reduce production during the months of July and August and for one week in December. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. In addition, automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of July, August and September due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models. Accordingly, our results reflect this seasonality.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 18,000 workers: 8,000 salaried employees and 10,000 hourly employees. In addition, we maintain an alternative workforce of 2,000 contract and temporary workers. Our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils, including the European Works Council and local trade unions such as Unite, U.K., CFE-CGC France and C.T.M. in Mexico.
