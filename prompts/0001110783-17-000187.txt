ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Monsanto Company, along with its subsidiaries, is a leading global provider of agricultural products for farmers. Our seeds, biotechnology trait products, herbicides and digital agriculture products provide farmers with solutions that help improve productivity, reduce the costs of farming and produce better foods for consumers and better feed for animals.
We manage our business in two reportable segments: Seeds and Genomics and Agricultural Productivity. We view our Seeds and Genomics segment as the driver for future growth for our company. In our Agricultural Productivity segment, global glyphosate producers have substantial capacity to supply the market, and we expect this global capacity to maintain pressure on margins.
On Sept. 14, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, a German stock corporation (“Bayer”), and KWA Investment Co., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Bayer (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement provides, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the company (the “Merger”), with the company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bayer. The Merger Agreement provides that each share of common stock of the company, par value $0.01 per share (other than certain shares specified in the Merger Agreement), outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be automatically converted into the right to receive $128.00 in cash, without interest. The obligation of the parties to complete the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, (i) the approval of the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company entitled to vote, which was obtained at a special meeting of the company’s shareowners held on Dec. 13, 2016, (ii) the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iii) the adoption of all approvals necessary for the completion of the Merger by the European Commission under Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004, (iv) the receipt of certain other required foreign antitrust approvals, (v) completion of the review process by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), (vi) no approvals related to CFIUS or antitrust laws having been made or obtained with the imposition of conditions that, together with Divestiture Actions (as defined in the Merger Agreement) undertaken, would reasonably be expected to have a Substantial Detriment (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (vii) no law, order or injunction having been enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered after Sept. 14, 2016, by a court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that is in effect that enjoins or otherwise prohibits the completion of the Merger, (viii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to certain qualifications) and (ix) the performance by the parties of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement in all material respects. Additional information about the Merger Agreement is set forth in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on Sept. 20, 2016.
We provide information about our business, including analyses, significant news releases and other supplemental information, on our website: www.monsanto.com. In addition, we make available through our website, free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

(1) | Including stacked-trait products, which are single-seed products in which two or more traits are combined.

Distribution of Products
We have a worldwide distribution and sales and marketing organization for our seeds and traits. We sell our products under Monsanto brands and license technology and genetic material to others for sale under their own brands. Through distributors, independent retailers and dealers, agricultural cooperatives and agents, we market our DEKALB, Asgrow and Deltapine branded germplasm to farmers in every agricultural region of the world. In the United States, we market regional seed brands under our American Seeds, LLC and Channel Bio, LLC businesses to farmers directly, as well as through dealers, agricultural cooperatives and agents. In countries where they are approved for sale, we market and sell our trait technologies with our branded germplasm, pursuant to license agreements with our farmer customers. In Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, we have implemented a point-of-delivery, grain-based payment system. We contract with grain handlers to collect applicable trait fees when farmers deliver grain for which trait fees have not already been paid. In addition to selling our products under our own brands, we license a broad package of germplasm and trait technologies to large and small seed companies in the United States and certain international markets. Those seed companies in turn market our trait technologies in their branded germplasm; they may also market our germplasm under their own brand name. Our vegetable seeds are predominantly marketed under either the Seminis or De Ruiter brand in more than 150 countries either directly to farmers or through distributors, independent retailers and dealers, agricultural cooperatives, plant raisers and agents.
Competition
The global market for the products of our Seeds and Genomics segment is competitive, and the competition has intensified. Both our row crops and our vegetable seed businesses compete with numerous multinational agrichemical and seed marketers globally and with hundreds of smaller companies regionally. Most of our seed competitors in row crops are also licensees of our germplasm or biotechnology traits, and a few of our vegetable seed business competitors have licensed biotech traits for sweet corn or genetic improvements through advanced breeding. In certain countries, we also compete with government-owned seed companies. Our biotechnology traits compete as a system with other practices, including the application of agricultural chemicals, and traits developed by other companies. Genome editing technology, application of emerging data sciences capabilities, and other advancements in breeding technology may enable potentially disruptive improvements in genetic performance by competitors or new market entrants. Our weed- and insect-control systems compete with chemical and seed products produced by other agrichemical and seed marketers. Competition for the discovery of new traits based on biotechnology or genomics is likely to come from major global agrichemical companies, smaller biotechnology research companies and institutions, state-funded programs and academic institutions. Enabling technologies to enhance biotechnology

MONSANTO COMPANY | 2017 FORM 10-K

trait development may also come from academic researchers and biotechnology research companies. Competitors using our technology outside of license terms and farmers who save seed from one year to the next also affect competitive conditions.
Product performance (in particular, crop vigor and yield for our row crops and quality for our vegetable seeds), customer support and service, intellectual property rights and protection, product availability and planning and price are important elements of our market success in seeds. In addition, distributor, retailer and farmer relationships are important in the United States and many other countries. The primary factors underlying the competitive success of traits are performance and commercial viability; timeliness of introduction; value compared with other practices and products; market coverage; service provided to distributors, retailers and farmers; governmental approvals; value capture; public acceptance; and environmental characteristics.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
In the United States and many foreign countries, we hold a broad business portfolio of patents, trademarks and licenses that provide intellectual property protection for our seeds and genomics-related products and processes. Monsanto routinely obtains patents and/or plant variety protection for its breeding technology, commercial varietal seed products and for the parents of its commercial hybrid seed products. We also routinely obtain registrations for commercial seed products in registration countries, as well as Plant Variety Protection Act Certificates in the United States and equivalent plant breeders’ rights in other countries. In soybeans, while our patent coverage on the first generation Roundup Ready trait for soybeans has expired, most Roundup Ready soybeans in the U.S. are protected by utility patents covering specific varieties. In addition, most of our customers and licensees are choosing our second generation Roundup Ready 2 Yield trait for soybeans with patent coverage that extends into the next decade. In Brazil and Argentina, farmers are adopting our next generation Intacta RR2 PRO soybean that also has patent coverage extending into the next decade. Patents on our next-generation herbicide trait which confers dicamba tolerance extend into the next decade. In corn, patent coverage on our first generation YieldGard trait has expired; however, most farmers have already upgraded to next generation branded corn traits with patent coverage extending into the next decade. In cotton, most growers globally are already using our second generation traits with patent coverage extending into the next decade.

We broadly license technology and patents to other parties. For example, we have licensed the Roundup Ready trait in soybean, corn, canola and cotton seeds, the YieldGard traits in corn and the Intacta RR2 PRO and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend traits in soybeans to a wide range of commercial entities and in some cases academic institutions. We also hold licenses from other parties relating to certain products and processes. For example, we have obtained licenses to certain technologies that we use to produce Roundup Ready seeds and SmartStax corn. These licenses generally last for the lifetime of the applicable patents.
We own trademark registrations and file trademark applications for the names and for many of the designs used on branded products around the world. Important company trademarks include Roundup Ready, Bollgard, YieldGard, Roundup Ready 2 Yield, Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, Intacta RR2 PRO, VT Double PRO and SmartStax for traits; Acceleron for seed treatment products; DEKALB, Asgrow and Deltapine for row crop seeds; and Seminis and De Ruiter for vegetable seeds.
Raw Materials and Energy Resources
In growing locations throughout the world, we produce directly or contract with third-party growers for corn seed, soybean seed, vegetable seeds, cotton seed, canola seed and other seeds. The availability of seed and the cost of seed production depend primarily on seed yields, weather conditions, grower contract terms and commodity prices. Where practical, we seek to manage commodity price fluctuations through the use of futures contracts and other hedging instruments. Where practicable, we attempt to minimize weather risks by producing seed at multiple growing locations and under irrigated conditions. Our Seeds and Genomics segment also purchases the energy we need to process our seed; these energy purchases are managed in conjunction with our Agricultural Productivity segment.

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY SEGMENT
Through our Agricultural Productivity segment, we manufacture Roundup brand herbicides and other herbicides and provide lawn-and-garden herbicide products for the residential market. The tabular information about net sales of agricultural productivity products that appears in Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) — Agricultural Productivity Segment — is incorporated by reference herein.

Major Products | Applications | Major Brands 
Herbicides | Nonselective agricultural and residential lawn and garden applications for weed control Selective agricultural applications for weed control | Roundup brandedproducts XtendiMax Herbicide with VaporGrip Technology

Distribution of Products
We have a worldwide distribution and sales and marketing organization for our agricultural productivity products. In some world areas, we use the same distribution and sales and marketing organization for our agricultural productivity products as for our seeds and traits. In other world areas, we have separate distribution and sales and marketing organizations for our agricultural productivity products. We sell our agricultural productivity products through distributors, independent retailers and dealers and agricultural cooperatives. In some cases outside the United States, we sell such products directly to farmers. We also sell certain of the chemical intermediates of our agricultural productivity products to other major agricultural chemical producers, who then market their own branded products to farmers. Certain agricultural productivity products for lawn-and-garden use are marketed through The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (“Scotts”).
Competition
We compete with numerous major global manufacturing companies for sales of agricultural herbicides. Competition from local or regional companies may also be significant. Global glyphosate producers have substantial capacity to supply the market, and we expect this global capacity to affect margins. Launch of dicamba-tolerant crop systems and other multiple mode of action herbicide systems is expected to broaden the competitive landscape with new competitive dynamics. Our lawn-and-garden business has fewer than five significant national competitors and a larger number of regional competitors in the United States. The largest market for our lawn-and-garden herbicides is the United States.
Competitive success in agricultural productivity products depends on price, product performance, the scope of solutions offered to farmers, market coverage, product availability and planning, and the service provided to distributors, retailers and farmers. Our lawn-and-garden herbicides compete on product performance, price and the brand value associated with our trademark Roundup. For additional information on competition for our agricultural herbicides, see Item 7 — MD&A — Outlook — Agricultural Productivity, which is incorporated by reference herein.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
We also rely on patent protection for the Agricultural Productivity segment of our business. Patents covering glyphosate, an active ingredient in Roundup branded herbicides, have expired in the United States and all other countries. However, we have multiple patents on different glyphosate formulations and manufacturing processes in the United States and other countries with varying expiration dates. We have obtained licenses to chemicals used to make Harness herbicides and hold trademark registrations for the brands under which our chemistries are sold. The most significant trademark in this segment is Roundup. We own trademark registrations for numerous variations of Roundup such as for Roundup WeatherMAX.
We hold (directly or by assignment) numerous phosphate mineral leases from the U.S. government, the state of Idaho and private parties. None of these leases are material individually, but are significant in the aggregate because elemental phosphorus is a key raw material for the production of glyphosate-based herbicides. The phosphate mineral leases have varying terms. The leases obtained from the U.S. government are of indefinite duration, subject to the modification of lease terms at 20-year intervals.

Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Some of these laws restrict the amount and type of emissions that our operations can release into the environment. Other laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq. (Superfund), can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any former or current site owners or operators or any parties who sent waste to these sites, without regard to fault or to the lawfulness of the original disposal. These laws and regulations may be amended from time to time; they may become more stringent. We are committed to long-term environmental protection and compliance programs that reduce and monitor emissions of hazardous materials into the environment, and to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns. Although the costs of our compliance with environmental laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, such costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our earnings or competitive position. In addition to compliance obligations associated with our operations, under the terms of our Sept. 1, 2000, Separation Agreement with Pharmacia (the Separation Agreement), we are required to indemnify Pharmacia for certain liabilities it may have for environmental remediation or other environmental responsibilities that are primarily related to Pharmacia’s former chemical and agricultural businesses. For information regarding certain environmental proceedings, see Item 3 — Legal Proceedings. See also information regarding environmental liabilities, appearing in Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 24 — Commitments and Contingencies, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Raw Materials and Energy Resources
We are a significant purchaser of basic and intermediate raw materials. Typically, we purchase major raw materials and energy through long-term contracts with multiple suppliers. Certain important raw materials are supplied by a few major suppliers. We expect the markets for our raw materials to remain balanced, though pricing may be volatile given the current state of the global economy. Energy is available as required, but pricing is subject to market fluctuations. Where practical, we seek to manage commodity price fluctuations through the use of futures contracts and other hedging instruments.
Our proprietary technology is used in various global locations to produce the catalysts used in various intermediate steps in the production of glyphosate. We believe capacity is sufficient for our requirements and adequate safety stock inventory reduces the risks associated with production outages. We manufacture and purchase disodium iminodiacetic acid, a key ingredient in the production of glyphosate, and purchase chlorine from limited major suppliers. We manufacture almost all of our global supply of elemental phosphorus, a key raw material for the production of Roundup herbicides. We have multiple mineral rights which, subject to obtaining and maintaining appropriate mining permits, we believe will provide a long term supply of phosphate ore to meet our needs into the foreseeable future. As part of the ongoing course of operating our phosphorus production, we are required to periodically obtain permits for new mining operations.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Monsanto’s expenses for research and development were $1,607 million in fiscal 2017, $1,512 million in fiscal 2016 and $1,580 million in fiscal 2015.
SEASONALITY AND WORKING CAPITAL; BACKLOG
For information on seasonality and working capital and backlog practices, see information in Item 7 — MD&A — Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources, which is incorporated herein by reference.
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS
As of Aug. 31, 2017, we employed approximately 20,500 regular employees worldwide and approximately 2,800 temporary employees. The number of temporary employees varies greatly during the year because of the seasonal nature of our business. We believe that relations between Monsanto and its employees are satisfactory. For additional information on employee relations, see Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 5 — Restructuring.
CUSTOMERS
In 2017, our four largest U.S. distributors and their affiliates represented, in the aggregate, 24 percent of our worldwide net sales and 43 percent of our U.S. net sales. During 2017, one major U.S. distributor and its affiliates, WinField Solutions, LLC, represented 11 percent of the worldwide net sales for our Seeds and Genomics segment and 19 percent of the U.S. net sales for our Seeds and Genomics segment.
