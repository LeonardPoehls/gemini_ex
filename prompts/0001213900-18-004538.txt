Item 1. Business
 
As used in this Annual Report, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Meridian,” “Company” or “our Company” refers to Meridian Waste Solutions, Inc.
 
Our Company
 
Historically, Meridian has generally operated three lines of business: (1) non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer and disposal services (the “Waste Business”); (2) technologies, centering on creating community-based synergies through healthcare collaborations and software solutions, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mobile Science Technologies, Inc. (the “Technologies Business”); and (3) innovations, striving to create value from recovered resources, through advanced byproduct technologies and assets found in downstream production, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Attis Innovations, LLC (the “Innovations Business”).
 
Late in the Summer of 2017, the Company began to explore the possibility of selling the Waste Business in order to reduce the Company’s leverage, dedicating resources to further growth in the Technologies Business and Innovations Business, where the Company saw robust pipelines for further opportunity. Such sale of the Waste Business was expected to clear the bottleneck caused by the debt encumbering the Waste Business, while, the Company believed, significantly increasing its enterprise value, and thereby paving the way to aggressively pursue acquisitions.
 
On February 20, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale of the Waste Business. Such sale of the Waste Business is expected to close on or about April 17, 2018.
 
We built the Company by providing everyday products and services that contribute to the lives of all people. We will continue to do so moving forward, but in new and, we believe, more profitable ways that capitalize on untapped opportunities and changing market conditions in healthcare and energy to build strategically compatible revenue lines in our Technologies Business and Innovations Business.

History
 
Meridian Waste Solutions, Inc. was incorporated in November 1993 in New York. Prior to October 17, 2014, the Company derived revenue by licensing its trademarks to a third party (the “Legacy Business”).
 
On October 17, 2014, the Company entered into that certain Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) by and among Here to Serve Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation, as seller (“Here to Serve”), the Company, as parent, Brooklyn Cheesecake & Dessert Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as buyer (the “Acquisition Corp.”), the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the “Company Executive”), the majority shareholder of the Company (the “Company Majority Shareholder”) and certain shareholders of Here to Serve (the “Here to Serve Shareholders”), pursuant to which the Acquisition Corp acquired from Here to Serve all of Here to Serve’s right, title and interest in and to (i) 100% of the membership interests of Here to Serve – Missouri Waste Division, LLC d/b/a Meridian Waste, a Missouri limited liability company (“HTS Waste”); (ii) 100% of the membership interests of Here to Serve Technology, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (“HTS Tech”); and (iii) 100% of the membership interests of Here to Serve Georgia Waste Division, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (“HTS Waste Georgia”, and together with HTS Waste and HTS Tech, collectively, the “Membership Interests”). As consideration for the Membership Interests, on October 31, 2014 (the “Closing Date”) (i) the Company issued to Here to Serve 452,707 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “HTS Common Stock”); (ii) the Company issued to the holder of Class A Preferred Stock of Here to Serve (“Here to Serve’s Class A Preferred Stock”) 51 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”); (iii) the Company issued to the holder of Class B Preferred Stock of Here to Serve (“Here to Serve’s Class B Preferred Stock”) an aggregate of 71,120 shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock,” together with the HTS Common Stock and the Series A Preferred Stock, the “Purchase Price Shares”); and (iv) the Company assumed certain liabilities.

As further consideration, on the Closing Date of the transaction contemplated under the Purchase Agreement, (i) in satisfaction of all accounts payable and shareholder loans, Here to Serve paid to the Company Majority Shareholder $70,000 and (ii) Here to Serve purchased from the Company Majority Shareholder 11,500 shares of the Company’s common stock for a purchase price of $230,000. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, to the extent Purchase Price Shares are issued to individual shareholders of Here to Serve at or upon closing of the Purchase Agreement: (i) shares of common stock of Here to Serve held by the individuals listed on Schedule 2.2 of the Purchase Agreement valued at $2,564,374.95 were cancelled in accordance with such Schedule 2.2; (ii) 50,000 shares of Here to Serve’s Class A Preferred Stock valued at $1,000 were cancelled; and (iii) 71,120 shares of Here to Serve’s Class B Preferred Stock valued at $7,121,000 were cancelled.
 
The closing of the Purchase Agreement resulted in a change of control of the Company and the Legacy Business was spun out to a shareholder in connection with the same.
 
On March 27, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation to change the name of the Company from Brooklyn Cheesecake & Desserts Company, Inc. to Meridian Waste Solutions, Inc. (the “Name Change”). 
 
On February 20, 2018, the Company entered into an Equity Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Meridian Waste Operations, Inc., a New York corporation (“Seller”) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Meridian, Meridian Waste Acquisitions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Buyer”) and solely for purposes of Sections 6.4, 6.7 and 11.18 thereof, Jeffrey S. Cosman, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Meridian, providing for, subject to the satisfaction or waiver (if permissible under applicable law) of specified conditions, the purchase of all of the membership interests of each of the direct wholly-owned subsidiaries of Seller (collectively, the “Acquired Parent Entities” and together with their direct and indirect subsidiaries, the “Acquired Entities”), comprising, with the Acquired Parent Entities’ subsidiaries, the Company’s Waste Business and constituting substantially all of the assets of the Company (such acquisition, the “Transaction”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, at the time the Transaction closes (the “Closing”) in consideration of $100,000, the Company will issue to the Buyer a warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase shares of common stock, par value $0.025 (“Common Stock”), of the Company, equal to two percent of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company on a fully-diluted basis as of the time of issuance of the Warrant (subject to adjustment as set forth therein).
 
At the time of the Closing, Buyer will have satisfied $75.8 million of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness under the Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated February 15, 2017 among certain of the Acquired Entities, Meridian, and Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) and assume the Acquired Entities’ obligations under certain equipment leases and other operating indebtedness. Meridian estimates that it will retain approximately $6.6 million of indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or a successor agreement and certain promissory notes payable for an aggregate amount of $1.475 million (the “Legacy Notes”).
 
This will leave the Company to operate its two remaining lines of business, the Technologies Business and the Innovations Business, unencumbered by $75.8 million of debt that was previously outstanding. 
 
Corporate Structure
 

Technologies Division
 
The Technologies Division of the Company, sometimes referred to herein as “Attis Healthcare”, is comprised of two divisions — (i) healthcare and (ii) Bright City, a mobile application. Our healthcare group focuses on improving patient care and providing cost-saving opportunities through innovative, compliant, and comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for patients and healthcare providers. We understand the challenges that come with trying to improve patient outcomes while driving down the cost of care, which is why we offer a broad portfolio of what we believe to be best-in-class solutions, combined with insight and expertise, to give providers tools that lead to healthier patients and communities. Attis Healthcare offers products and services in a variety of areas, including hospital consulting services for both laboratory services and emergency department revenue enhancement, polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) molecular testing, pharmacogenetics (“PGx”) testing, and medication therapy management. 
 
Bright City is an all-in-one citizen engagement mobile application that allows cities and their residents to communicate more directly. This allows to make for safer communities, community leadership to be more proactive, and citizens to be more connected. Bright City provides direct and two-way communication, which means citizens can reply and communicate directly with local law enforcement and town, city or municipal staff. Bright City is specific and targeted, which prevents communications from becoming lost in the clutter of social media and allows for communications from citizens to be routed directly to the appropriate city staff for response and resolution. Bright City includes camera, video, and GPS locator functionality, which provides specific location data and a more accurate description of the reported activity, expediting the flow of information. Bright City acts as the eyes and ears of the city, allowing towns, cities and municipalities to expand security and increase connectivity.

Customers
 
Currently, within our Technologies Division, we have agreements with three (3) hospitals to manage their laboratory services. As part of those agreements, we provide consulting services in the areas of equipment procurement, materials management, staffing, training, billing and laboratory compliance. In addition to the three (3) hospitals we currently work with, we have a plan in place to bring on at least another four (4) hospital laboratories during the remainder of 2018, but cannot guarantee that we will be able to reach agreement with these laboratories. We are also working several large hospital groups regarding emergency services coding, where we provide expertise in connection with billing in the emergency department with an expectation of growing revenue for the hospital through improved billing and coding.
 
In connection with our PCR testing services, we focus on long term care facilities, home healthcare agencies and physician practices. We expect to continue expanding our footprint in this business, both by adding additional physician practices and long term care facilities in the Southeast, as well as expanding across the country to the Midwest, Northeast, and beyond.
 
Our PGx services are designed to assist large employers with reducing the amount of money they spend in pharmacy costs for their workforce. Specifically, Attis Healthcare has engaged multiple health benefits brokers who work with large employers to help drive this technology to these employers. Attis Healthcare is currently analyzing pharmacy data for multiple large employers.
 
Attis Healthcare is also currently working directly with both community pharmacies and large pharmacy corporations to offer PGx and medication therapy management to patient customers of the pharmacies. Attis Healthcare has an agreement with four (4) community pharmacies in the Southeast and is engaged in discussions with corporations about adding this technology to their pharmacy shelves.
 
Bright City is currently in the pilot phase, with delivery to the first municipality, located in the Southeast U.S., scheduled for the early second quarter of 2018. The Company expects to add two (2) additional pilot municipalities in either the second quarter or third quarter of 2018 and will then concentrate on a larger scale sales pipeline across the U.S.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Growth in Existing Markets
 
We currently provide laboratory testing services to a variety of physician offices and long term care facilities and we currently manage hospital laboratories in three (3) hospitals, all largely concentrated in the Southeast U.S. We are focused on increasing our sales in these markets by growing our customer base through increased market penetration and expanding existing customers through use of our other services. We have also begun engaging large employers on the PGx portion of our business and will continue to look to expand the number of employers who utilize our PGx and medication therapy management solution as a means of reducing their pharmacy costs.

Expanding into New Markets
 
In 2018 and beyond, we plan to expand into new markets, specifically targeting the Midwest United States and the Western part of the United States. We have and will continue to engage sales professionals that have strong relationships in all areas of the United States and will utilize those relationships to build our business into previously untapped markets.
Integration
 
Our growth strategy also includes the plan to become more integrated across our business lines by purchasing long term care facilities, nursing homes, and rural hospitals, which will allow us to further integrate our laboratory testing in the markets where the testing is most effective. We also plan to offer billing services and other consulting services, further integrating our various service offerings in the healthcare market.
Acquisition
 
Our revenue model is based on organic growth of operations, the acquisition of established operations in new markets, as well as being able to execute value-adding, tuck-in acquisitions. We hope to direct acquisition efforts towards those markets in which we would be able to provide vertically integrated services. Prior to acquisition, we analyze each prospective target for cost savings through the elimination of inefficiencies and excesses that are typically associated with private companies competing in fragmented industries. We aim to realize synergies from consolidating businesses into our existing operations, which we hope will allow us to reduce capital and expense requirements.
Competition
 
Competition in the lab services industry is dominated by two large national laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp, with multiple regional laboratories providing laboratory services as well. However, because of their size, these laboratories struggle to provide high quality customer service. Our focus in building out hospital laboratories is to improve the customer service available to physician practices and other healthcare facilities, including turnaround time for test results, while bolstering the healthcare services offered in rural America and offering jobs in underserved communities. 
Sales & Marketing
 
We focus our marketing efforts on increasing and extending business with existing customers, as well as increasing our new customer base. We target physician practices, hospitals, long term care facilities, and large employers. With respect to hospitals, we particularly focus on rural hospitals, which are historically underserved. We believe that by improving the healthcare in the rural community, we can help stimulate job growth and improve the quality of life in this historically underserved population. We have a seasoned sales force of both executives and direct line sales employees with a wealth of experience in the healthcare sector. We utilize relationships across the United States to build our sales force, relying on relationships with strong sales professionals.
Government Contracts
 
We currently have one (1) governmental contract with a municipality in connection with Bright City. Bright City is still in the pilot phase; we expect to grow the number of governmental contracts in the second and third quarters of 2018.

Regulation
 
Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and healthcare laws and regulations. Governmental agencies have the authority to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and to obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in cases of violations. We believe that regulation of the healthcare industry will continue to evolve, and we will adapt to future legal and regulatory requirements to ensure compliance. Attis Healthcare strives to operate under the regulations and laws put in place to protect our medical communities and to comply with all regulations and laws that are put in place. Because compliance is important to us, we constantly review and assess our policies, practices and procedures. This compliance is, and may in the future continue to be, costly. In particular, the governing laws regarding medical laboratories are strictly enforced and reviewed frequently. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) inspections take place every two years, and the laboratories we manage or own must be in strict compliance. The section of the federal regulations titled "Standards and Certification: Laboratory Requirements" is issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to enact the CLIA law passed by Congress. In general terms, the CLIA regulations establish quality standards for laboratory testing performed on specimens from humans, such as blood, body fluid and tissue, for the purpose of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease, or assessment of health.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively, “HIPAA”) impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans, health care providers, health care clearinghouses (known as “covered entities”) and their business associates use, disclose and safeguard protected health information (“PHI”). Criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with HIPAA standards. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the “HITECH Act”), enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, amended HIPAA to impose additional restrictions on third-party funded communications using PHI and the receipt of remuneration in exchange for PHI. It also extended HIPAA privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates. In addition to HIPAA, state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is HIPAA.
 
Finally, the Health Insurance Marketplaces (formerly known as the “exchanges”) are required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to PII, and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective of PII as those the Health Insurance Marketplace has implemented for itself or non-Health Insurance Marketplace entities, which include insurers offering plans through the Health Insurance Marketplaces and their designated downstream entities, including PBMs and other business associates. These standards may differ from, and be more stringent than, HIPAA.
 
Attis Healthcare aims to strictly comply with HIPAA regulations. Annual certification for all employees with a reasonable expectation of coming into contact with protected health information is required.  Our customers and prospective customers are “Covered Entities” under HIPAA and its accompanying regulations.  As such, Customer is required to make reasonable efforts to limit as necessary the disclosure of PHI as defined by HIPAA.  To the extent that a Vendor or Customer has access to such PHI while supplying products or services or otherwise performing under the Order or complying with these Terms, Vendor or Customer will treat such PHI in accordance with the applicable Business Associate Addendum between the parties, including but not limited to the use of commercially reasonable safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of PHI except as provided under the Order.
 
The Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) applies, or may apply, to some of the laboratories that Attis Healthcare manages. When JCAHO does have an oversight role, the hospital laboratories that we manage are in compliance with their safety regulations. JCAHO’s focus is on healthcare systems.  Today, most hospitals are accredited by JCAHO.  Laboratories are part of these healthcare systems and are thereby required to comply with the JCAHO safety regulations. JCAHO regulations are extensive and numerous.  They have very specific requirements on many safety matters.  JCAHO also has a “deemed status” acknowledgement by the federal government. 
 
Passed in 2010, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) affects virtually every aspect of health care in the country. In addition to establishing the framework for every individual to have health coverage, ACA enacted a number of significant health care reforms. Many of these reforms affect the coverage and plan designs that are provided by our health plan clients. As a result, these reforms impact a number of our services and business practices. Some significant ACA provisions are still being finalized (e.g., implementation of the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage has been delayed by Congress) and parts of ACA may still face potential Congressional changes, so the full impact of ACA on our Company is still uncertain.

Innovations Division
 
Attis Innovations, LLC
 
Attis Innovations (“Innovations”) focuses on producing sustainable materials and fuels from renewable sources at costs equal to or less than those otherwise produced from fossil fuels. By processing targeted feedstocks, we believe Innovations will be able to produce materials used in the following markets: bioplastics, consumer goods, adhesives, carbon fiber, renewable fuels, and green chemicals, among others.
 
We intend to leverage our expertise in waste streams and our technology development experience to harvest value from biomass. To this end, we have assembled a growing portfolio of technologies that are being designed and developed to refine biomass in a series of process steps that are analogous to petroleum refining, in which crude oil is sequentially processed into a wide range of products. Our patented and patent-pending lignin conversion and refining processes, which fractionate and convert cellulosic biomass into ethanol or butanol and a renewable alternative for petroleum-derived resins, were recently awarded a $3 million grant from the USDA.
 
Our ultimate plan for this business is to finance, build, own and operate facilities based on our technologies to generate shareholder value by producing and selling renewable fuels, plastics, resins and other carbon-neutral offsets from low-value lignin and other cellulosic feedstocks; including pulp and paper by-products, first generation biofuel by-products, and other overlooked carbon-containing residuals. The Company is continuing to evaluate acquisitions and other transactions, some of which include existing production assets that are ideal for co-location of facilities based on our technologies. First generation biofuel plants can be particularly favorable targets inasmuch as our technologies have been proven to have the potential to generate more income by converting and refining existing by-products as compared to the income of current plants using traditional methods.
 
Innovations is comprised of three divisions:
 

● | Attis R&D Services 
--+------------------------------------------------------------
● | Attis Biomaterials 
● | Attis Biofuels 

Attis R&D Services
 
Beginning in January 2018, Attis R&D Services, through American Science and Technology Corporation (AST), holds a ‘for hire’ 15,000 sq. ft. R&D facility (the “AST Facility”) capable of processing almost any form of biomass and converting it into targeted materials for testing and evaluation purposes. This facility is a full-service pilot test facility, available to this industry and dedicated to developing innovative biobased products using its patented AST-Organosolv process to convert lignocellulosic biomass into high-value, bio-based chemicals and products.  The AST Facility, located in Wausau, Wisconsin, operates at various scales from a laboratory level to multi-ton batches and is equipped with a wide range of biomass processing equipment to provide a unique opportunity to accelerate the advancement of the bio-based economy. The AST Facility was built through a series of grants and private funding to generate slightly positive cash flow on annual testing revenues between $0.9 to $1.3 million over the past three years. Innovations is in the process of executing its plan to upgrade the AST Facility to generate improved revenues. 
Attis Biomaterials
 
Attis Biomaterials is intended to provide for the recovery and conversion of practically any form of biomass into targeted bio-based materials. Attis Biomaterials plans to produce and supply high-performance plant-derived materials, chemicals, and molecularly consistent feedstocks to manufacturing industries at costs competitive with those for materials otherwise derived from fossil fuels. Plastic, adhesives, and transportation fuels are typically produced from non-renewable materials such as crude oil and natural gas. Innovations is focusing on providing the same materials directly from biomass, which can be sustainably harvested and replanted. We believe Attis Biomaterials can cost-effectively recover greater amounts of high-quality sources of carbon-based feedstocks from biomass than those previously available, thereby substantially increasing the revenues and profits generated per unit of biomass harvested. 
 
In addition to processing virgin biomass feedstocks, we believe Attis Biomaterials will also be able to recover lignin from byproduct streams from the pulp and paper industry, as well as from the cellulosic ethanol industry. Presently, these pulp and paper producers and biorefineries typically burn their lignin byproduct generating only about $50 per ton for its energy content, whereas Attis Biomaterials is expected to be able to result in the recovery of about 50% of the byproduct stream as a valuable lignin polymer that can instead be sold for $500 to $800 per ton.

The United States produces about 73 million metric tons of paper from about 219 million metric tons of trees. This paper industry does not target the recovery of lignin from its byproduct leaving more than 35 million metric tons of lignin available from this industry alone. Innovations’ technology is capable of recovering up to 30% of this lignin for use in higher valued markets. While the global demand for biomaterials cannot currently consume this volume of material, Innovations is collaborating with various entities to integrate our bio-based materials into traditional product offerings. 
 
As an example, the team working with Innovations on a $3 million USDA grant to develop lignin into residential siding products is comprised of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the University of Tennessee’s Center for Renewable Carbon, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, the Natural Resource Research Institute, Long Trail Sustainability, and Innovations’ research and development unit, American Science and Technology Corporation.
 
Innovations is engaging partners for services agreements for Attis Biomaterials, with revenue-generating operations expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018, following the Company’s acquisition of certain property. Additionally, Innovations has hired Emerging Fuels Technology to develop a method to convert the Innovations lignin into transportation fuels such as diesel and gasoline.
 
In order to meet the EPA’s biofuel production goals, more than 500 new traditional cellulosic ethanol facilities would need to be built by 2022. Because these traditional facilities do not currently recover a valuable form of lignin, they are unable to compete against fossil fuels due to the low revenues generated per unit of biomass consumed. Like pulp and paper producers, these cellulosic biorefineries burn the lignin they produce for an energy value of only about $50 per ton. Attis Biomaterials can allow these facilities to increase revenue and value by adding technology that would enable such facilities to recover the lignin. Further, the availability of this technology could result in the EPA requiring more strict compliance with existing regulations and granting fewer waivers for non-compliance, which in turn would cause a greater demand of Attis Biomaterials’ technology.
 
Attis Biofuels
 
Attis Biofuels is intended to produce biofuels from low-cost feedstocks. These feedstocks include cellulose, hemicellulose lignin, sugars, fats and vegetable oils. 
 
Attis Biofuels plans to purchase sugars from Attis Biomaterials and to convert this sugar into ethanol. This form of ethanol is referred to as cellulosic ethanol and sold at a premium to corn derived ethanol due the additional renewable energy credits it receives.
 
In addition, Attis Biofuels plans to use its capital and energy efficient biodiesel and renewable diesel process technology to convert fats and oils into fuels. Attis Biofuels has designed a hybrid process technology that allows for the production of either biodiesel or renewable diesel depending on the market demand for each.
 
When producing biodiesel, Attis Biofuels’ process does not require the use of a catalyst; as a result, the system is able to produce biodiesel at an advantage of about a 10 to 30 cents per gallon over companies that use such other catalysts. 
 
When producing renewable diesel, Attis Biofuels’ process consumes about 30-50% less hydrogen than those processes currently in production. This is accomplished by stripping glycerin from the triglycerides prior to hydroprocessing. Hydrogen accounts for between 25 and 60 cents of the processing cost associated with producing a single gallon of renewable diesel and the Attis Biofuels technology provides a cost advantage by reducing the amount of hydrogen consumed. Furthermore, the use of less hydrogen, reduces the energy conversion requirement and can increase incentive payments from places like California where Low Carbon Fuel Standards (“LCFS”) are in place to incentives more efficient fuel conversion.
 
Innovations is engaging partners for services agreements for Attis Biofuels, with revenue-generating operations expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018, following the Company’s acquisition of certain property. Attis Biofuels would use the same property and same facility as Attis Biomaterials.
 
Attis IP Holdings 
 
In addition to the three divisions of Innovations, Attis IP Holdings is a company designated to hold and manage Innovations’ patent portfolio. This business unit will charge each of Innovations’ process subsidiaries a royalty fee to be used to account for the cost associated with managing and prosecuting the patents. The objective of this business unit is to be cash flow neutral. 
Customers
 
Presently, Innovations does not have a fully commercialized system in operation; therefore, it currently has a limited customer base that is solely associated with its contract R&D service work out of its Wausau, WI biomass processing facility. Our plan is to target customers that will be feedstock providers for its fully commercialized process technologies once we have a fully commercialized system in operation.

Our Operating Strengths
 
Experienced Leadership
 
Innovations has an experienced management team that has a successful track record in multiple industries including waste and byproduct recovery, renewable fuel production, intellectual property development, plastics, federal and state policy initiatives and process and chemical engineering. Innovations division president is David Winsness who has over 25 years of experience in process engineering and technology development. Over the last 15 years, Mr. Winsness has worked in the corn-based ethanol industry in the US where he and his team developed and commercialized a patented process to extract corn oil from the backend of dry mill ethanol facilities for use as a feedstock in renewable fuel production and animal feed. Today, that technology is deployed at an estimated 92% in the US ethanol industry and is responsible for an estimated $750 million in annual revenue.
 
Innovations draws on the deep experience of its team and relies heavily on years of industry experience across multiple competencies to drive the development of its patented and patent-pending technologies to full commercialization as well as various biobased end product offerings.
 
Vertically Integrated Operations
 
Innovations vertically integrated operations enable us to control the entire biobased supply chain from feedstock to end product, allowing us to maximize revenues by tightly controlling input costs and increasing the gross margin on finished products. This starts with identifying and forming strategic partnerships with biomass suppliers who possess high-quality materials that are not currently being processed due to location or scale.
 
With a steady stream of inexpensive, high-quality biomass feedstock, Innovations is able to capitalize on its AST process technology that cost-effectively and efficiently processes and converts biomass into refined forms of commodities such as sugar and lignin polymers. Providing further flexibility is our technologies’ ability to process at varying scales economically, opening opportunities to process biomass feedstocks previously thought too difficult due to quantity available or location.
 
Innovations can market these materials independently or utilize them in downstream conversion systems that enable end-use product manufacturing of siding and other types of durable, thermoplastic products. This provides tremendous flexibility to sell intermediate biomaterials for further processing or end products, allowing us to maximize revenue throughout the supply chain and gain significant competitive advantages.
 
Technology Assets
 
Through a combination of intellectual property and proprietary know-how, we are well positioned to maintain and grow our competitive advantage in processing and end product offerings.
 
Through recent acquisitions and internal development, Innovations has a strong intellectual property base that comprises both issued patents and pending patent applications that cover a range of process and product applications. Below is a list of our current portfolio of issued patents:
 

● | US Patent #9,365,525 – System and Method for Extraction of Chemicals from Lignocellulosic Materials 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | US Patent #9,382,283 – Oxygen Assisted Organosolv Process, System, and Method for Delignification of Lignocellulosic Materials and Lignin Recovery 
● | US Patent #9,815,985 – High-Performance Lignin-Acrylonitrile Polymer Blend Materials

-

 

In addition to such patents, Innovations has a deep collection of pending patents, all of which are geared towards strengthening our existing issued patents, expanding our capabilities, and protections into other new and emerging applications. Like our issued patents, if granted, these will cover both process and products for various applications that Innovations currently engages in or will evaluate in the future.
 
Acquisition Integration
 
Innovations growth strategy includes the acquisition of assets and technologies that create synergies and diversify risk for its core business. We specifically target acquisitions that are either significantly enhanced by our existing technology or enable accelerated market opportunities and increased revenues for our business. These acquisitions include processing technology from American Science and Technology, advanced resin formulations with Advanced Lignin Biocomposites and a portfolio of biobased fillers from Genarex.
Our Growth Strategy
 
Growth of Existing Markets
 
We believe as oil prices rise, reserves dwindle, and as consumers become increasingly environmentally conscious, demand for fuels and consumer products generated by sustainable feedstocks will increase. Current federal and state initiatives mandate a gradual increase in low carbon fuels that will drive the market in the short-term. We believe our technology platform provides the most cost-competitive options for biobased fuels and products today, which will result in securing market share as demand increases.
Expand into New Markets
 
Innovations is currently marketing our products to customers as a simple way to make traditional products cheaper and ecofriendly. Our low CAPEX, low-value feedstocks, and unique conversion technology allow us to manufacture products with high-value properties at a lower cost. These durable, biobased materials will be able to offer solutions in applications that were previously limited due to cost and performance restrictions. In many cases, Innovations’ materials will be less expensive than even petroleum-based products, allowing for more sustainable, durable plastics to reach even more product spaces.
 
Innovations will continue to expand its renewable diesel technology to include a wider range of feedstocks and further refine its biomass separation byproducts to include various specialty green chemicals.
 
Industry Overview 
 
During the 21st century, developed nations have prioritized research and commercialization of sustainable biofuels and biomaterials produced from renewable feedstocks. In the United States, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set statutory volumes of renewable fuels to be mixed into the domestic fuel supply with volumes increasing each year. The Congressional goal set for 2017 was 24 billion gallons of renewable fuel, however the EPA had to reduce the volume to 19.28 billion gallons mainly due to a lack of advanced biofuel production.
 
A large majority of the existing biofuels and biomaterials market is comprised of materials produced with technology and know-how that has been in use for hundreds of years. Innovation and commercialization efforts have proven to be expensive and insufficient to fuel industrial growth that was predicted at the turn of the 21st century. However, government incentives and increased consumer demand for sustainable materials remain, creating enormous opportunity for those that can develop cost-effective solutions.

Competition
 
Competition in advanced biofuels and biomaterials is expanding due to the growth of the industry, government incentives and the evolution of new technologies. However, in both its biorefinery and renewable biofuels divisions, Innovations technology platform holds an advantage over its competitors due to its low capital requirements.
 
Many of our competitors in the biorefining space generate revenue from only one product stream - cellulose. Innovations’ proprietary technology can create high-value products from all constituents of the feedstock - cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose. Innovations is not aware of a commercialized biorefinery that is capable of producing a melt-flowable lignin; most competitors burn their low-quality lignin for energy purposes that yield only about $50 to $100 per ton consumed, whereas Innovations’ melt-flowing lignin is valued at more than $500 per ton in multiple applications. Innovations’ melt-flowable lignin not only has a quality advantage over its competitors, but it is also safer to store and compound, as existing lignin recovery operations are subject to explosion under pneumatic transfer due to the small particle, dust-like properties of the dried lignin.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Innovations is interested in markets that look to increase profits either by extracting the full potential of their byproduct streams or by reducing the costs of their inputs, and we believe Innovations’ technology platform is the solution. Out of our facility in Wausau, WI, contract R&D services are marketed to large agricultural and biomass processors that have underutilized biomass streams in their operations. These customers use our biomass separation and classification services to determine potential high-value applications for their residual byproducts. In many cases, these services are also used to find and evaluate feedstocks for new Innovations biorefineries.
 
Innovations’ biomaterial business markets plant-based products to companies looking to reduce cost while using sustainable materials. Target industries include large scale producers of durable plastics such as compounders and converters. Our customers are able to replace the more expensive petroleum resins with our plant-based resins and biofillers while retaining physical properties.
 
Government Controls
 
The Company is a party to a $3 million USDA grant to further develop the Innovations biorefinery process and end applications for our unique lignin product. The USDA is active in its monetary and political support for the biorefining industry, and the awarded grant demonstrates the agency’s support of Innovations’ technology platform and its ability to offer cost-effective solutions to the bioeconomy.
Regulation
 
Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the production of renewable fuels and materials, the protection of the environment, and the safety of our employees. The Clean Air Act and analogous state laws and regulations impose obligations related to emissions of air pollutants, including greenhouse gases. The Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws and regulations govern discharges into waters. The Occupational Safety and Health Act and analogous state laws and regulations govern the protection of the health and safety of employees.
 
In addition, some state and federal laws and regulations support the industries in which we operate. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates the increased use of renewable fuels in the US fuel supply which is expected to reach 36 billion gallons in 2022. Compliance with the law is overseen by the EPA and executed through a program called the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) where Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) are used to show compliance. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded on the open market. The market price of detached RINs props up the price of eligible renewable fuels.

In California, the state’s Air Resources Board oversees the Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program which was first enacted by executive order in 2007 and since amended by the state legislature. The program requires a 7.5% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels from 2010 to 2020. Eligible fuels, such as renewable diesel, receive a premium when sold into the California market based on their carbon reductions and the daily price of tradable carbon credits.
 
Seasonality
 
A potential risk in processing biomass is the degree to which the feedstock varies seasonally and is often harvested over a short period of time. Crops that are harvested once annually pose an additional complication of storage and proper maintenance creating a need for additional infrastructure and handling. We plan to hedge this risk by targeting feedstock streams that are less seasonal and that are consistently available over the course of the year to minimize storage infrastructure and potential feedstock degradation.
WASTE DIVISION
 
Upon the closing of the Purchase Agreement, which is expected to occur on or about April 17, 2018, the Company will have completely divested the Waste Business and the business described under this section “WASTE DIVISION” will cease to be a part of the Company.

Collection Services
 
Meridian, through its subsidiaries, provides solid waste collection services to approximately 65,000 industrial, commercial and residential customers in the Metropolitan St. Louis, Missouri area, and, recently, approximately 33,000 in Virginia. 
 
In our commercial collection operations, we supply our customers with waste containers of various types and sizes. These containers are designed so that they can be lifted mechanically and emptied into a collection truck to be transported to a disposal facility. By using these containers, we can service most of our commercial customers with trucks operated by a single employee. Commercial collection services are generally performed under service agreements with a duration of one to five years with possible renewal options. Fees are generally determined by such considerations as individual market factors, collection frequency, the type of equipment we furnish, the type and volume or weight of the waste to be collected, the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal.
 
Residential solid waste collection services often are performed under contracts with municipalities, which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in these municipalities. These contracts usually range in duration from one to five years with possible renewal options. Generally, the renewal options are automatic upon the mutual agreement of the municipality and the provider; however, some agreements provide for mandatory re-bidding. Alternatively, residential solid waste collection services may be performed on a subscription basis, in which individual households or homeowners’ or similar associations contract directly with us. In either case, the fees received for residential collection are based primarily on market factors, frequency and type of service, the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal.
 
Additionally, we rent waste containers and provide collection services to construction, demolition, and industrial sites and some larger commercial locations. We load the containers onto our vehicles and transport them with the waste to a landfill, a transfer station, or a recycling facility for disposal. We refer to this as “roll-off” collection. Roll-off collection services are generally performed on a contractual basis. Contract terms tend to be shorter in length, in some cases having terms of only six months, and may vary according to the customers’ underlying projects.
 
Transfer and Disposal Services
 
Landfills are the main depository for solid waste in the United States. Solid waste landfills are built, operated, and tied to a state permit under stringent federal, state and local regulations. Currently, solid waste landfills in the United States must be designed, permitted, operated, closed and maintained after closure in compliance with federal, state and local regulations pursuant to Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended. We do not operate any hazardous waste landfills, which may be subject to even greater regulations. Operating a solid waste landfill includes excavating, constructing liners, continually spreading and compacting waste and covering waste with earth or other inert material as required, final capping, closure and post-closure monitoring. The objectives of these operations are to maintain sanitary conditions, to ensure the best possible use of the airspace and to prepare the site so that it can ultimately be used for other end use purposes.
 
Our transfer stations allow us to consolidate waste for subsequent transfer in larger loads, thereby making disposal in our otherwise remote landfills economically feasible. A transfer station is a facility located near residential and commercial collection routes where collection trucks take the solid waste that has been collected. The waste is unloaded from the collection trucks and reloaded onto larger transfer trucks for transportation to a landfill for final disposal. As an alternative to operating a transfer station directly, we could negotiate the use of a transfer station owned by a private party or operated by a competitor, which may not be as profitable as operating our own transfer station. In addition to increasing our ability to internalize the waste that our collection operations collect, using transfer stations reduces the costs associated with transporting waste to final disposal sites because the trucks we use for transfer have a larger capacity than collection trucks, thus allowing more waste to be transported to the disposal facility on each trip.

Our Operating Strengths
 
Vertically Integrated Operations
 
The vertical integration of our operations allows us to manage the waste stream from the point of collection through disposal, which we hope will enable us to maximize profit by controlling costs and gaining competitive advantages, while still providing high-quality service to our customers. In the St. Louis market, because we have integrated our network of collection, transfer and disposal assets, primarily using our own resources, we generate a steady, predictable stream of waste volume and capture an incremental disposal margin. We charge tipping fees to third-party collection service providers for the use of our transfer stations or landfills, providing a source of recurring revenue. We believe the internalization of waste provides us with a significant cost advantage over our competitors, positioning us well to win additional profitable business through new customer acquisition and municipal contract awards. We also believe this vertically integrated structure enables us to quickly and efficiently integrate future acquisitions of transfer stations, collection operations or landfills into our current operations.
Landfill Assets
 
We now have three active and strategically located landfills at the core of our integrated operations which we believe provides us a significant competitive advantage, in that we do not need to use our competitors’ landfills. Our landfills have substantial remaining airspace.
 
The valuation of our landfill assets was based on approximately 4 million cubic yards (cy) total in remaining airspace and approximately 32.7 million cy total in expansion airspace. These landfill assets are comprised of the Eagle Ridge Landfill, the Tri-City Landfill and the Lunenberg Landfill. The Company acquired the Tri-City Landfill and the Lunenberg Landfill on February 15, 2017. There have not been any significant changes.
 
The Eagle Ridge Landfill has approximately 1.3 million cy of remaining airspace and approximately 30 million cy of expansion airspace, with an estimated life through approximately June 2021. Expenses were recorded based on a blended average rate of $20.71 per ton, and there have been no recent significant changes to such rates.
 
The Tri-City Landfill has approximately 1.3 million cy of remaining airspace and approximately 700,000 cy of expansion airspace, with an estimated life through approximately September 2021. The Company is also pursuing opportunities to acquire additional expansion airspace. Expenses were recorded based on a blended average rate of $18.74 per ton, and there have been no recent significant changes to such rates.
 
The Lunenberg Landfill, which has approximately 1.3 million cy of remaining airspace and approximately 4.6 million cy of expansion airspace, with an estimated life through approximately October 2024. The Company is also pursuing opportunities to acquire additional expansion airspace. Expenses were recorded based on a blended average rate of $10.93 per ton, and there have been no recent significant changes to such rates.

The value of our landfills may be further enhanced by synergies associated with our vertically integrated operations, including our transfer stations, which enable us to cover a greater geographic area surrounding the landfills, and provide competitive advantages in that we would not need to use our competitors’ landfills. In our experience there has generally been a shift towards fewer, larger landfills, which has resulted in landfills that are generally located farther from population centers, with waste being transported longer distances between collection and disposal, typically after consolidation at a transfer station. With landfills, transfer stations and collection services in place, we aim to provide vertically integrated operations that cover the substantial geographic area surrounding the landfill.
 
Long-Term Contracts
 
In Missouri, we serve approximately 65,000 residential, commercial, and construction and industrial customers, with no single customer representing more than 11% of revenue in 2016. Our municipal customer relationships are generally supported by contracts ranging from three to seven years in initial duration most with subsequent renewal periods, and we have a historical renewal rate of 100% with such customers. Our standard service agreement is a five-year renewable agreement. We believe our customer relationships, long-term contracts and exceptional retention rate provide us with a high degree of stability as we continue to grow.
 
Customer Service
 
We maintain a central focus on customer service and we pride ourselves on trying to consistently exceed our customers’ expectations. We believe investing in our customers’ satisfaction will ultimately maximize customer loyalty price stability.
Commitment to Safety
 
The safety of our employees and customers is extremely important to us and we have a strong track record of safety and environmental compliance. We constantly review and assess our policies, practices and procedures in order to create a safer work environment for our employees and to reduce the frequency of workplace injuries.
Our Strategy
 
Sale of Waste Assets
 
Following the approvals of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Meridian Board, on February 20, 2018, Seller Parties (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), Meridian Waste Acquisitions, LLC (“Buyer”), a Delaware limited liability company formed by Warren Equity Partners Fund II and Jeffrey S. Cosman, an officer, director and majority shareholder of Meridian (“Cosman”), entered into an Equity Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Buyer will purchase from Seller (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) all of the membership interests in each of the direct wholly-owned subsidiaries of Seller (the “Acquired Parent Entities” and together with each direct and indirect subsidiary of the Acquired Parent Entities, the “Acquired Entities”), which constitute the Waste Business, and each such Acquired Parent Entity will continue as wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer (the “Transaction”).
 
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the closing of the Transaction (the “Closing”), Buyer will pay Seller Parties $3.0 million in cash; satisfy $75.8 million of outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement; and assume the Acquired Entities’ obligations under certain equipment leases and other operating indebtedness. Following the Closing, the Seller Parties expect they would retain approximately $6.6 million of outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement and all other assets and obligations of Meridian, the Technologies Business and the Innovations Business. At the Closing, Meridian will issue to Buyer a warrant to purchase shares of common stock, par value $0.025, of Meridian, equal to two percent of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Meridian on a fully-diluted basis as of Closing (subject to adjustment as set forth therein and as more fully described in the Purchase Agreement) on such terms to be determined by Meridian and Buyer. The Purchase Agreement also provides for Meridian shareholders who properly exercise dissenters’ rights under New York law to seek appraisal in accordance with the New York Business Corporation Law, as amended.

The consummation of the Transaction is subject to customary and other closing conditions, including (i) receiving the approval of holders of at least two-thirds majority of the voting power of the outstanding Company common stock pursuant to the New York Business Corporation Law (the “Meridian Shareholder Approval”), (ii) the Buyer receiving the proceeds of its debt financing, and (iii) the absence of legal restraints preventing the consummation of the Transaction.
 
The Purchase Agreement contains certain customary covenants, including covenants providing (i) for each of the parties to use reasonable best efforts to cause the transaction to be consummated and (ii) for the Seller Parties to cause the Acquired Entities to conduct their business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice during the interim period between the execution of the Purchase Agreement and completion of the Transaction. The Purchase Agreement also provides that during the period before the Meridian Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Board of Directors of Meridian can consider an unsolicited alternative proposal that it concludes in good faith is more favorable from a financial point of view to the shareholders of Meridian than the Transaction.
 
The Purchase Agreement contains certain customary termination rights of Seller Parties and Buyer.
 
In addition, Buyer may terminate the Purchase Agreement if (A) the shareholders representing the requisite majority for the Meridian Shareholder Approval and the written consent of Seller’s sole shareholder shall not have been delivered to the Buyer and the Seller Parties by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the third business day immediately following the date of the Purchase Agreement and (B) at any time prior to the 21st day from the date of the Purchase Agreement, if the Buyer shall have discovered any matter, condition, or circumstance with respect to the Acquired Entities or the business of the Acquired Entities during its due diligence investigation that has a material effect, in the Buyer’s sole discretion, on the Buyer’s willingness to proceed with the transactions contemplated herein and in the other transaction documents under the terms and conditions set forth therein. The Purchase Agreement contains specified termination rights for the parties and provides that, in connection with the termination of the Purchase Agreement under specified circumstances, Seller Parties will be required to pay to Buyer a “termination fee” up to $3.5 million plus certain fees and expenses of Buyer.
 
On February 23, 2018, certain shareholders of the Company holding in aggregate approximately 66.78% of the outstanding voting shares of the Company as of the record date, February 19, 2018, executed an irrevocable written consent approving the following actions: (the “Written Consent”):
 

1. | the sale of the membership interests of each of the direct wholly-owned subsidiaries of Seller (collectively, the “Acquired Parent Entities”), comprising, with the Acquired Parent Entities’ subsidiaries (collectively, with the Acquired Parent Entities, the “Acquired Entities”), the Company’s Solid Waste Business and constituting substantially all of the assets of the Company, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement and the consummation of the transactions described therein; and
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | the amendment of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, upon the closing of the Transaction to change the Company’s corporate name from Meridian Waste Solutions, Inc. to Attis Industries Inc.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the event that the sale of the Waste Business is not consummated, the Company intends to continue operation of the Waste Business as it evaluates further strategic alternatives, including pursuing the sale of the Waste Business to other purchasers.
 
Waste Industry Overview
 
The non-hazardous solid waste industry can be divided into the following three categories: collection, transfer and disposal services. In our management’s experience, companies engaging in collection and/or transfer operations of solid waste typically have lower margins than those additionally performing disposal service operations. By vertically integrating collection, transfer and disposal operations, operators seek to capture significant waste volumes and improve operating margins.
 
During the past four decades, our industry has experienced periods of substantial consolidation activity; however, we believe significant fragmentation remains. We believe that there are two primary factors that lead to consolidation:
 

● | stringent industry regulations have caused operating and capital costs to rise, with many local industry participants finding these costs difficult to bear and deciding to either close their operations or sell them to larger operators; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | larger operators are increasingly pursuing economies of scale by vertically integrating their operations or by utilizing their facility, asset and management infrastructure over larger volumes and, accordingly, larger solid waste collection and disposal companies aim to become more cost-effective and competitive by controlling a larger waste stream and by gaining access to significant financial resources to make acquisitions. 


16
--

Competition
 
The solid waste collection and disposal industry is highly competitive and, following consolidation, remains fragmented, and requires substantial labor and capital resources. The industry presently includes large, publicly-held, national waste companies such as Republic Services, Inc, Waste Connections, Inc., Advanced Disposal, Inc. and Waste Management, Inc., as well as numerous other public and privately-held waste companies. Our existing market and certain of the markets in which we will likely compete are served by one or more of these companies, as well as by numerous privately-held regional and local solid waste companies of varying sizes and resources, some of which have accumulated substantial goodwill in their markets. We also compete with operators of alternative disposal facilities and with counties, municipalities and solid waste districts that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations. Public sector operations may have financial advantages over us because of potential access to user fees and similar charges, tax revenues and tax-exempt financing.
 
We compete for collection based primarily on geographic location and the price and quality of our services. From time to time, our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand their market share or service areas or to win competitively bid municipal contracts. These practices may cause us to reduce the price of our services or, if we elect not to do so, to lose business.
 
Our management has observed significant consolidation in the solid waste collection and disposal industry, and, as a result of this perceived consolidation, we encounter competition in our efforts to acquire landfills, transfer stations and collection operations. Competition exists not only for collection, transfer and disposal volume but also for acquisition candidates. We generally compete for acquisition candidates with large, publicly-held waste management companies, private equity backed firms as well as numerous privately-held regional and local solid waste companies of varying sizes and resources. Competition in the disposal industry may also be affected by the increasing national emphasis on recycling and other waste reduction programs, which may reduce the volume of waste deposited in landfills. Accordingly, it may become uneconomical for us to make further acquisitions or we may be unable to locate or acquire suitable acquisition candidates at price levels and on terms and conditions that we consider appropriate, particularly in markets we do not already serve.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We focus our marketing efforts on increasing and extending business with existing customers, as well as increasing our new customer base. Our sales and marketing strategy is to provide prompt, high quality, comprehensive solid waste collection to our customers at competitive prices. We target potential customers of all sizes, from small quantity generators to large companies and municipalities. Because the waste collection and disposal business is a highly localized business, most of our marketing activity is local in nature.
Government Contracts
 
We are party to contracts with municipalities and other associations and agencies. Many of these contracts are or will be subject to competitive bidding. We may not be the successful bidder, or we may have to substantially lower prices in order to be the successful bidder. In addition, some of our customers may have the right to terminate their contracts with us before the end of the contract term.
 
Municipalities may annex unincorporated areas within counties where we provide collection services, and as a result, our customers in annexed areas may be required to obtain service from competitors who have been franchised or contracted by the annexing municipalities to provide those services. Some of the local jurisdictions in which we currently operate grant exclusive franchises to collection and disposal companies, others may do so in the future, and we may enter markets where franchises are granted by certain municipalities, thereby reducing the potential market opportunity for us.

Regulation
 
Our business is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and various other federal, state and local environmental, zoning, air, water, transportation, land use, health and safety agencies. Many of these agencies regularly inspect our operations to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations. Governmental agencies have the authority to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and to obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties in cases of violations. We believe that regulation of the waste industry will continue to evolve, and we will adapt to future legal and regulatory requirements to ensure compliance.
 
The permit for our landfill requires us to post a closure bond, which currently stands at approximately $7.4 million, with premiums in the approximate amount of $250,000.
 
Our operations are subject to extensive regulation, principally under the federal statutes described below.
 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, or RCRA. RCRA regulates the handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and delegates authority to states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid wastes. On October 9, 1991, the EPA promulgated Solid Waste Disposal Facility Criteria for non-hazardous solid waste landfills under Subtitle D of RCRA. Subtitle D includes location standards, facility design and operating criteria, closure and post-closure requirements, financial assurance standards and groundwater monitoring, as well as corrective action standards, many of which had not commonly been in place or enforced at landfills. Subtitle D applies to all solid waste landfill cells that received waste after October 9, 1991, and, with limited exceptions, required all landfills to meet these requirements by October 9, 1993. All states in which we operate have EPA-approved programs which implemented at least the minimum requirements of Subtitle D and in some states even more stringent requirements.
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or “CERCLA.” CERCLA, which is also known as Superfund, addresses problems created by the release or threatened release of hazardous substances (as defined in CERCLA) into the environment. CERCLA’s primary mechanism for achieving remediation of such problems is to impose strict joint and several liability for cleanup of disposal sites on current owners and operators of the site, former site owners and operators at the time of disposal and parties who arranged for disposal at the facility (i.e., generators of the waste and transporters who select the disposal site). The costs of a CERCLA cleanup can be substantial. In addition to ordering remediation work to be undertaken, federal or state agencies can perform remediation work themselves and seek reimbursement of their costs from potentially liable parties, and may record liens to enforce their cost recovery claims. Beyond cleanup costs, federal and state agencies may also assert claims for damages to natural resources, like groundwater aquifers, surface water bodies and ecosystems. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the existence or intentional disposal of “hazardous wastes” (as defined under RCRA), but can also be based upon the release or threatened release, even as a result of lawful, unintentional and non-negligent action, of any one of the more than 700 “hazardous substances” listed by the EPA, even in minute amounts.
 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, or the Clean Water Act. This act establishes rules regulating the discharge of pollutants into streams and other waters of the United States (as defined in the Clean Water Act) from a variety of sources, including solid waste disposal sites. If wastewater or stormwater from our transfer stations may be discharged into surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and obtain discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional rules under the Clean Water Act, which establish standards for management of storm water runoff from landfills and which require landfills that receive, or in the past received, industrial waste to obtain storm water discharge permits. In addition, if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly-owned treatment works, the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by the treatment works. Also, if development of a landfill may alter or affect “wetlands,” the owner may have to obtain a permit and undertake certain mitigation measures before development may begin. This requirement is likely to affect the construction or expansion of many solid waste disposal sites.

The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended, or the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act provides for increased federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air pollutants. The EPA has applied the Clean Air Act to solid waste landfills and vehicles with heavy duty engines, such as waste collection vehicles. Additionally, in March 1996, the EPA adopted New Source Performance Standards and Emission Guidelines (the “Emission Guidelines”) for municipal solid waste landfills to control emissions of landfill gases. These regulations impose limits on air emissions from solid waste landfills. The Emission Guidelines impose two sets of emissions standards, one of which is applicable to all solid waste landfills for which construction, reconstruction or modification was commenced before May 30, 1991. The other applies to all municipal solid waste landfills for which construction, reconstruction or modification was commenced on or after May 30, 1991. These guidelines, combined with the new permitting programs established under the Clean Air Act, could subject solid waste landfills to significant permitting requirements and, in some instances, require installation of gas recovery systems to reduce emissions to allowable limits. The EPA also regulates the emission of hazardous air pollutants from municipal landfills and has promulgated regulations that require measures to monitor and reduce such emissions.
 
Climate Change. A variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements have been introduced that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases known as greenhouse gases. Congress has considered legislation directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There has been support in various regions of the country for legislation that requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and some states have already adopted legislation addressing greenhouse gas emissions from various sources. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA that greenhouse gases are an “air pollutant” under the federal Clean Air Act and, thus, subject to future regulation. In a move toward regulating greenhouse gases, on December 15, 2009, the EPA published its findings that emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment because greenhouse gases are, according to EPA, contributing to climate change. On October 30, 2009, the EPA published the greenhouse gas reporting final rule, effective December 29, 2009, which establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring certain specified industries as well as operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases to inventory and report their greenhouse gas emissions annually. Municipal solid waste landfills are subject to the rule. In 2009, the EPA also proposed regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles. According to the EPA, the final motor vehicle greenhouse gas standards will trigger construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources that exceed potential-to-emit (PTE) thresholds for regulated pollutants. As a result, the EPA has proposed to tailor these programs such that only large stationary sources, such as electric generating units, cement production facilities, and petroleum refineries will be required to have air permits that authorize greenhouse gas emissions.
 
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, or OSHA. OSHA establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and various record keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations.
 
Flow Control/Interstate Waste Restrictions. Certain permits and approvals, as well as certain state and local regulations, may limit a landfill or transfer station to accepting waste that originates from specified geographic areas, restrict the importation of out-of-state waste or wastes originating outside the local jurisdiction or otherwise discriminate against non-local waste. From time to time, federal legislation is proposed that would allow some local flow control restrictions. Although no such federal legislation has been enacted to date, if such federal legislation should be enacted in the future, states in which we use landfills could limit or prohibit the importation of out-of-state waste or direct that wastes be handled at specified facilities. These restrictions could also result in higher disposal costs for our collection operations. If we were unable to pass such higher costs through to our customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.
 
State and Local Regulation. Each state in which we now operate or may operate in the future has laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, treatment, handling, transportation and disposal of solid waste, occupational safety and health, water and air pollution and, in most cases, the siting, design, operation, maintenance, closure and post-closure maintenance of landfills and transfer stations. State and local permits and approval for these operations may be required and may be subject to periodic renewal, modification or revocation by the issuing agencies. In addition, many states have adopted statutes comparable to, and in some cases more stringent than, CERCLA. These statutes impose requirements for investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites and liability for costs and damages associated with such sites, and some provide for the imposition of liens on property owned by responsible parties. Furthermore, many municipalities also have ordinances, local laws and regulations affecting our operations. These include zoning and health measures that limit solid waste management activities to specified sites or activities, flow control provisions that direct or restrict the delivery of solid wastes to specific facilities, laws that grant the right to establish franchises for collection services and then put such franchises out for bid and bans or other restrictions on the movement of solid wastes into a municipality.

Certain state and local jurisdictions may also seek to enforce flow control restrictions through local legislation or contractually. In certain cases, we may elect not to challenge such restrictions. These restrictions could reduce the volume of waste going to landfills in certain areas, which may adversely affect our ability to operate our landfills at their full capacity and/or reduce the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal services. These restrictions may also result in higher disposal costs for our collection operations. If we were unable to pass such higher costs through to our customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.
 
Permits or other land use approvals with respect to a landfill, as well as state or local laws and regulations, may specify the quantity of waste that may be accepted at the landfill during a given time period and/or specify the types of waste that may be accepted at the landfill. Once an operating permit for a landfill is obtained, it must generally be renewed periodically.
 
There has been an increasing trend at the state and local level to mandate and encourage waste reduction and recycling and to prohibit or restrict the disposal in landfills of certain types of solid wastes, such as construction and demolition debris, yard wastes, food waste, beverage containers, unshredded tires, lead-acid batteries, paper, cardboard and household appliances. 
 
Many states and local jurisdictions have enacted “bad boy” laws that allow the agencies that have jurisdiction over waste services contracts or permits to deny or revoke these contracts or permits based on the applicant’s or permit holder’s compliance history. Some states and local jurisdictions go further and consider the compliance history of the parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, in addition to that of the applicant or permit holder. These laws authorize the agencies to make determinations of an applicant’s or permit holder’s fitness to be awarded a contract to operate and to deny or revoke a contract or permit because of unfitness unless there is a showing that the applicant or permit holder has been rehabilitated through the adoption of various operating policies and procedures put in place to assure future compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 
Some state and local authorities enforce certain federal laws in addition to state and local laws and regulations. For example, in some states, RCRA, OSHA, parts of the Clean Air Act and parts of the Clean Water Act are enforced by local or state authorities instead of the EPA, and in some states those laws are enforced jointly by state or local and federal authorities.
 
Public Utility Regulation. In many states, public authorities regulate the rates that landfill operators may charge.
 
Seasonality
 
Based on our industry and our historic trends, we expect our operations to vary seasonally. Typically, revenue will be highest in the second and third calendar quarters and lowest in the first and fourth calendar quarters. These seasonal variations result in fluctuations in waste volumes due to weather conditions and general economic activity. We also expect that our operating expenses may be higher during the winter months due to periodic adverse weather conditions that can slow the collection of waste, resulting in higher labor and operational costs.

WelNess Benefits and IntegrityLab Solutions Purchase Agreement
 
On November 17, 2017, (the “Closing Date”), Mobile Science Technologies, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company entered into that certain Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) by and among four individuals, as sellers (together, the “Sellers”), the Company, and Mobile Science Technologies, Inc., as buyer (“Buyer”), pursuant to which Buyer acquired from Sellers all of Sellers’ right, title and interest in and to 100% of the membership interests (the “Membership Interests”) of WelNess Benefits, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company, and Integrity Lab Solutions, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company, that together own and operate laboratory marketing, management, and testing businesses.

On the sixtieth (60th) day after the third full anniversary of the Closing, the Buyer shall pay a cash bonus (the “Third Year Cash Bonus”) to Sellers equal twenty five percent (25%) of the combined earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, excluding Accounts Receivables which are more than 120 days old and capital expenditures, of the Operating Companies (the “Last Year CA EBITDA”) for immediately preceding 12-month period ending on October 31 of such year.
 
As an additional earn-out opportunity, the Company shall issue to Sellers shares of the Company’s restricted common stock (the “Tranche III Shares”) as follows: (i) on the ninetieth (90th) day after first anniversary of the Closing (“First Anniversary Earnout Payment Date”), Tranche III Shares in the amount equal to 500% of the CA EBITDA for the immediately preceding 12-month period ending on October 31 of such year, less the amount of the cash bonus paid on the First Bonus Payment Date, if any; and (ii) on the ninetieth (90th) day after the second, third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the Closing (each an “Anniversary Earnout Payment Date”), Tranche III Shares in the amount equal to the product of the Applicable Year Multiplier (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the difference between the CA EBITDA for the immediately preceding 12-month period ending on October 31 of such year, less the amount of the applicable cash bonus, if any, paid on the immediately preceding Bonus Payment Date, (the “Adjusted CA EBITDA”) and less (x) the previous year’s Adjusted CA EBITDA on the second and third Anniversary Earnout Payment Date, or (y) the previous year’s CA EBITDA on the fourth and fifth Anniversary Earnout Payment Date. The “Applicable Year Multiplier” to be used in calculating the Tranche III Share Values shall be 4 for the second Anniversary Earnout Payment Date, 3 for the third Anniversary Earnout Payment Date, 2 for the fourth Anniversary Earnout Payment Date, and 1 for the fifth Anniversary Earnout Payment Date. The number of Tranche III Shares to be issued on any Anniversary Earnout Payment Date shall be calculated by dividing the Tranche III Share Value for the applicable Anniversary Earnout Payment Date by (a) the VWAP of the Company’s restricted common stock as of the last Trading Day prior to the applicable Anniversary Earnout Payment Date, or (b) $1.09, whichever is greater.
 
As additional consideration, the Company issued to Sellers, on the Closing Date, an aggregate of 1,000,000 five year warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share, exercisable beginning six months after the date of issuance thereof (the “Seller Warrants”).

Series F Preferred Stock
 
On February 22, 2018, the Company submitted for filing with the Secretary of State of the State of New York the Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, in the form attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereof, (the “Amendment to Certificate”), which amended the designations, rights and preferences of the Series F Preferred Stock, as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion, in accordance with the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws.
 
The shares of Series F Preferred Stock have a stated value of $1,000.00 per share are convertible into Common Stock at a price of $0.94 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Conversion Price”) and earn dividends at the rate of 8% per annum. In addition, on each Trigger Date, the Conversion Price shall be reduced, and only reduced, to the lesser of (x) the then Conversion Price, as adjusted and taking into consideration any prior resets, or (y) the greater of (A) the Floor Price and (B) 90% of the quotient of (I) the sum of the VWAP of the Common Stock for each of the five (5) Trading Days with the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock during the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Day period ending and including the Trading Day immediately preceding such Trigger Date, divided by (II) five (5) (the “Reset Conversion Price”, which shall thereafter be the new Conversion Price, subject to further adjustment hereunder, and such 20 Trading Day period shall be referred to herein as a “Measurement Period”). Any adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to the occurrence of a Trigger Date shall be effective retroactively to the date of original issuance of the Series F Preferred. “Floor Price” means $0.20 or such lower price as mutually agreed to by the Company and the purchasers of a majority in interest of the securities issued pursuant to the Offering and then outstanding (subject to the prior consent of the Nasdaq Stock Market before the effective date of any such voluntary reduction). “Trigger Date” shall mean each of the following dates: (i) the later of (x) the thirtieth day immediately following the date of the effectiveness of the initial Registration Statement covering any portion of the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Amendment to Certificate) and (y) the thirtieth day immediately following the date that Shareholder Approval is obtained and deemed effective, (ii) the thirtieth day following the date of the effectiveness of any other Registration Statement covering any portion of the Registrable Securities, (iii) the thirtieth day following the six month anniversary of the Closing Date, in the event that all of the Registrable Securities are not then registered on an effective Registration Statement, (iv) the tenth (10th) Trading Day immediately following the public announcement of the Asset Sale (or, if earlier, the date of the initial filing with the Commission disclosing the occurrence of the consummation of the Asset Sale) and (v) thirtieth day immediately following the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, in the event that the Company fails for any reason to satisfy the current public information requirement under Rule 144(c) at any time during the period commencing on the six month anniversary of the Closing Date through the 12 month anniversary of the Closing Date and all of the Registrable Securities are not then registered on an effective Registration Statement. “Asset Sale” means a sale by the Company of all or substantially all of the assets related to the Company’s waste business occurring prior to April 30, 2018.
 
Provided that no events requiring adjustment pursuant to the designations for the Series F Preferred or the Warrants occur, the Offering would result in a maximum of 2,659,571 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock and 5,319,143 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, resulting in a maximum of 7,978,715 shares, assuming compliance with the respective limitations on conversion or exercise contained within the designations for the Series F Preferred and Warrants. In the event that adjustments are required due to the Company’s stock price falling, or otherwise, based on the floor price of $0.20 for the Series F Preferred, and assuming such price applies for the Warrants as well, then the Offering would result in a maximum of 12,499,987 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock and 25,265,932 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, resulting in a maximum of 37,765,919 shares, assuming compliance with the respective limitations on conversion or exercise contained within the designations for the Series F Preferred and Warrants. In the event that an adjustment to the Conversion Price of Series F Preferred occurs, to the extent that shares of Series F Preferred have been converted to shares of Common Stock, such shareholders will receive additional shares of Common Stock such that they will have received the total number of shares of Common Stock into which the total numbers of shares of Series F Preferred are convertible, regardless of whether such shares of Series F Preferred have actually been converted.

Beginning on February 23, 2019, the holders of the Series F Preferred shall be entitled to receive dividends at the rate of 8% per annum, payable in cash or, at the option of the Company, in shares of Common Stock, subject to certain equity conditions.
 
The shares of Series F Preferred Stock rank senior to the Common Stock and do not have voting rights.
