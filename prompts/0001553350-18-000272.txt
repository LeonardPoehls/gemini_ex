ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
History
 
MediXall Group, Inc. (formerly Continental Rail Corp.) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on December 21, 1998 under the name IP Gate, Inc. 

On December 31, 2002, IP Gate, Inc. entered into a share exchange agreement and merged with Action Stocks, Inc., a Nevada corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, the original shareholders of IP Gate retained ownership of their shares and Action Stocks shareholders received 14.25 shares of the surviving corporation for each share they owned prior to the merger. The management of the former Action Stocks became the officers and directors of the surviving corporation, which then changed its name to Action Stocks, Inc. 

On June 3, 2003, Action Stocks merged with Classic Health Systems. Classic Health Systems was in the Durable Medical Goods industry delivering equipment for home care such as oxygen, ventilators, beds, and CPAPs. 

On June 23, 2003 Action Stocks changed its name to Specialized Home Medical Services, Inc. as a result of the acquisition of Classic Health Systems Inc. which continued as a wholly owned subsidiary. On January 3, 2006, the officers and directors resigned in favor of a new board and the incoming President and CEO purchased a block of treasury stock, and became the majority shareholder. Immediately following this change of control, the new management added another wholly owned subsidiary, South East Stamp Sales, LLC in order to expand the companys operations. This new subsidiary provided cataloging and valuation services for auction companies. In December 2007, the durable medical equipment business and inventory was sold for cash to a similar business operating in the same market, due to declining sales. 

Specialized Home Medical Services changed its name to IGSM Group, Inc. in April 2007 to reflect its diverse operations and the removal of the medical related business. The South East Stamp Sales, LLC subsidiary continued operations until December 2009, when it lost the majority of its business due to an economic downturn in its primary customer. The company attempted to engage in an internet technology business through a licensing or acquisition strategy, but it was unsuccessful. 

Late December 2012, the Company contracted the services of TBG Holdings Corporation (TBG) who assisted with restructuring the Company into a short-line and regional freight railroad holding company. On June 23, 2013, IGSM Group entered into a share exchange agreement with Transportation Management Services, Inc. under which IGSM acquired all of the outstanding stock of TMS in exchange for the issuance of 1,500,000 shares of preferred IGSM stock. TMS was in the business of providing consulting services to railroad companies. IGSM Group changed its name to Continental Rail Corp effective July 10, 2013. 

On June 19, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Continental Rail, LLC (LLC), a Florida limited liability company, and the Series A Preferred Shareholders of the Company. The Company was actively seeking to secure financing for the purchase of the Delta Southern Railroad (Delta), a Class III short-line railroad headquartered in Tallulah, Louisiana. Delta was subsequently purchased by Golden Gate Capital (Golden Gate), a private equity firm in San Francisco, California. Golden Gate decided that it was in its best interest to utilize the railroad operations management skills of certain Preferred Shareholders of the Company to manage the daily operations of Delta (the Manager). By the terms of the Agreement, however the Delta Manager cannot be owned (more than 10%) or controlled by a public company. Consequently, the LLC was organized by the Preferred Shareholders as the vehicle to manage Delta and satisfy the conditions set forth in the agreement. In conjunction with this transaction the Company received a 10% interest in the LLC and the preferred shareholders returned their preferred shares to the Company for cancelation. 

On June 24, 2016, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with TBG where the Company exchanged 100% of its membership interest in the LLC in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of the Company held by TBG. The exchange of the LLC interest was facilitated for the purpose of the Companys pursuit of future acquisitions and/or mergers with other public and/or private entities that would expand its opportunities to create value for the Companys shareholders. The 1,000,000 shares were cancelled.

On November 22, 2016, Continental Rail Corp. filed a Certificate of Amendment pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) sections 78.385 and 78.390 and a Certificate of Change pursuant to NRS 78.0295 with the Nevada Secretary of State. The Certificate of Amendment provided for a change in the Companys name from Continental Rail Corp. to MediXall Group, Inc. to reflect a change in our business model to a Healthcare Incubator of development-stage healthcare technology companies. The Certificate of Change provided for a 1 for 15 reverse stock split of the Companys issued and outstanding common stock, reducing the number of common shares outstanding from 38,921,911 to 2,595,379 of which approximately 85% was controlled by related parties. No preferred shares were outstanding at the time of the Merger discussed below.

On December 13, 2016 the Company, completed a Share Exchange Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Merger) with IHL of Florida, Inc., a Florida corporation (IHL) established in April, 2016 and under common control with the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, IHL shareholders transferred to the Company all their issued and outstanding shares of capital stock. In exchange, the Company agreed to issue 41,131,000 shares of common stock to IHL shareholders, including 18,599,750 shares issued to common control parties and 264,894 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, all issued to common control parties, and convertible into 24,900,000 shares of common stock. The share issuances represent approximately 94.1% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company post-closing. As a result, the Company (i) became the 100% parent of IHL; (ii) assumed the operations of IHL; and (iii) changed its name from Continental Rail Corp. to MediXall Group, Inc. 

Due to the common control of IHL and the Company, pursuant to ASC 805-50-25, Transactions Between Entities Under Common Control and other SEC guidance including for lack of economic substance, the Merger was accounted for as a transfer of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities under the predecessor value method of accounting. Financial statement presentation under the predecessor values method of accounting as a result of a business combination between entities under common control requires the receiving entity (i.e., the Company) to report the results of operations as if both entities had always been combined. The consolidated financial statements include both entities full results since the inception of IHL in April, 2016.

Prior to the merger, on July 8, 2016, IHL entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with MediXall, Inc., a Florida corporation founded in November 2015. MediXall, Inc is a technology and innovative-driven organization purposefully designed and structured to bring effective change to the healthcare industry by improving healthcare and reducing costs. The Company currently has the rights to use 13 patents and 18 pending patents related to healthcare technologies licensed by The Quantum Group, Inc., (a privately-held Florida corporation), an incubator of companies that design, develop and deploy innovative solutions, technology, products, and services to the healthcare industry. MediXall, Inc. had no material operations prior to the Share Exchange which resulted in the acquisition of $2,200 of debt and no assets or revenue generating activities.

Business Overview
 
MediXall Group, Inc. (hereinafter MediXall) is a technology and innovation- driven organization purposefully designed and structured to bring effective change to the U.S. Healthcare Industry. We believe that our revolutionary approach will help drive much of the change we envision is needed in our healthcare system.

Our mission is to build out the MediXaid Provider Network and deliver products and services to that network that are focused on improving communication; providing better technology and support services; enabling more efficient, cost-effective healthcare for the consumer.

MediXall Group, Inc. currently has three operating divisions.

1.
 MediXall Healthcare Marketplace (MediXall Platform)
 2.
 MediXall Finance Group
 3.
 MediXall Investment Group

The Healthcare EcoSystem 

MediXalls mission for its Healthcare EcoSystem is to create a dynamic distribution platform that attracts and supports new generations of healthcare technologies and services, delivering innovative solutions that help our Provider Network clients optimize their financial and operational performance. Management has developed three strategic initiatives for its Healthcare EcoSystem - the Network, the Marketplace, and the Strategic Partner Ecosystem - to identify opportunities in the market and seamlessly integrate innovative solutions that will benefit MediXall, our clients, and the healthcare industry as a whole. 


2


Strategic Initiative 1: Build a Robust Healthcare Provider Network

Since inception, MediXalls first strategic initiative was centered around building a robust MediXaid Provider Network of Healthcare Providers, which include licensed and certified diagnostic centers, medical service providers, medical product providers and physician practices. The MediXaid Provider Network continues to gain significant traction in South Florida, and the Companys network growth has accelerated over the past few months, now surpassing 5,500 healthcare providers registered in its Early Adopter Program.

Management believes that building the MediXaid Provider Network is key to expanding MediXalls reach, as it creates access to a growing network of credentialed service providers, fully vetted suppliers, medical facilities and diagnostic centers.

This affords MediXalls portfolio of products and services the opportunity to become the preferred resource of ancillary services to healthcare providers that participate in its provider network, as well as to other healthcare providers, physician groups, testing facilities, nursing homes and hospitals. Furthermore, MediXalls integrated network of providers will offer leverage to substantially accelerate distribution for future products and services that MediXall brings to market. In order to have a strong launch of the MediXall Platform and good momentum during the early quarters, MediXall has established a strong marketing and sales team that will grow with the company, continue to facilitate the rapid development of a strong healthcare provider network in South Florida and further serve as a foundation for expanding the Companys reach throughout the State, and nationwide.

Strategic Initiative 2: Develop a Central Platform Connecting Providers, Patients, and Stakeholders with Just-in-time Service Model

The second strategic initiative was to develop the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace, which would act as the central portal for the MediXaid Provider Network, consumer/patients, and many of the products and services we have under the MediXall Umbrella. Because of the complexity and fragmentations of the industry, online marketplaces such as WebMD have seen remarkable success within the U.S. digital healthcare market. Generally accepted as a forum with potential to reduce inefficiencies and increase transparency, the online marketplace is a free-market environment, utilizing the power of competition to empower the consumer as it reduces inefficiencies and increases transparencies. In this era of rapidly increasing deductibles and healthcare costs, the MediXall cloud-based platform is designed to be transformational and disruptive to traditional methods of medical care and provisioning of medical services to the consumer.

Our vision for the MediXall Platforms prominence in the healthcare marketplace is to create a unified online environment that connects physicians and caregivers to patients, and payers to the caregivers, across all healthcare settings. Starting with pricing transparency and leveraging the just-in-time service delivery model, we intend to expand our service offerings to enable smarter care and empower the customer/patient at virtually every point of the healthcare continuum; whether organically, through acquisitions, or through integration with our strategic partners solutions. As we expand the Healthcare EcoSystem, the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace will facilitate such transformation in the future of healthcare by offering community connectivity, interoperability, data analytics, and consumer engagement features and functionality.

Strategic Initiative 3: Create Partnerships and JVs to Offer Needed Products and Services to Both Healthcare Providers and Their Customer/Patients

The third strategic initiative was to create an integrated healthcare partner ecosystem that would enhance the operations of the healthcare providers, offering patients the tools and services that would allow them to take control of their own health-care. It is Managements prime directive to provide high-quality integrated services, encompassing a broad range of functionality and information, acting as a liason between providers, patients and payers. An outstanding ecosystem of strategic partners who extend the value of our platform in powerful ways is taking shape. These developers and partners have built healthcare apps, devices, and technology enabled services aimed at improving the quality of healthcare, empowering the patient, and lowering the cost of health delivery. In response to the enthusiastic welcome for healthcare pricing transparency from the 5,500-plus healthcare providers that have become Early Adopters of the MediXaid Provider Network so far, our team began to ask what more we could do to support our practitioners in building their practices. Many expressed a need for better access to patient information, better ways to increase attendance to appointments, and financial services to support both patient procedures and practice growth and operations. As part of our MediXall business model, we are selecting the highest quality and most effective products and services to add to our Healthcare EcoSystem that will address these needs, while at the same time help MediXaid Provider Network members increase their net margins and keep more of their revenue, as well as assist in reducing their business operations burden.


3


After launch of the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace in March 2018, we plan to integrate with our technology partners, enabled by our application programming interface, or API, through which we will grant access to approved developers and partners. We believe that the opportunities and technology provided by our partners enhance the power of our marketplace and contribute to the attractiveness and critical position of the MediXall Platform within the Healthcare EcoSystem.

Furthermore, the strategic partnerships that MediXall is engaging will ultimately help to accelerate the Companys mergers and acquisitions pipeline and increase the value of the proposition for potential acquisition targets.

How the MediXall Healthcare EcoSystem Works 

Our MediXall Healthcare Marketplace, along with our strategic partners and their respective products and services should create powerful network effects that benefit our entire Healthcare EcoSystem. As more local healthcare businesses adopt our platform, more provider listings appear on the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace and third-party partner sites available through the MediXaid Provider Network. As awareness of these businesses increases through these marketing channels, they will attract more consumers to our platform. Those consumers then attract even more healthcare businesses to our platform. As those businesses and consumers engage in more transactions on our platform, this increases bookings and partner revenue, and enables additional revenue streams from demand generation. Finally, as we add more healthcare providers and consumers to our Healthcare EcoSystem, we attract more technology developers and strategic partners who can leverage our Provider Network and use our API to develop additional apps and services that extend the capabilities of our MediXall Healthcare Marketplace.
 
Milestones

Since inception, MediXall Group has achieved the following:

·
 The MediXall Healthcare Marketplace has soft-launched in the testing phase - on track for a 1st quarter 2018 controlled launch.

o
 Quantum Innovations Inc.  a developer of state-of-the-art business models with approved and pending patented technology, and leading industry re-search initiatives, Quantum Innovations provides unique value, solutions and insight towards the transformation of the healthcare industry.
Division 1: MediXall Healthcare Marketplace Overview 

MediXall Healthcare Marketplace, a wholly owned subsidiary of MediXall Group, is currently launching a new generation Healthcare Platform to address the growing need of self-pay and high deductible consumers for greater transparency and price competition in their healthcare costs. Our integrated cloud-based platform for the healthcare industry helps providers simplify the way they run their businesses, attract and engage more patients, boost their revenues and focus more on providing high quality care to their patients. Moreover, the platform helps patient/clients find price transparency and gives them the ability to make informed choices based on price, location and schedule for requested medical products and services. In this era of rapidly increasing deductibles and healthcare costs, the cloud-based Healthcare Marketplace is designed to be transformational and disruptive to traditional methods of medical care and provisioning of medical services to the consumer.

The MediXall Healthcare Marketplace is an electronic healthcare platform where patients/ clients can shop for their own medical services; diagnostic procedures and services; and medical equipment and devices. The platform will offer consumers and corporations, such as self-insured companies operating under ERISA (Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974) and private insurance companies, the ability to cost compare, price and sort for medical services and products by price, first available appointment and nearest location. We believe the platform will be disruptive to the traditional method of provisioning medical care and services; and, strike at the heart of runaway costs, in a climate of soaring personal deductibles and increasing healthcare insurance costs to individuals and corporations.

The cloud-based platform is designed to work in both a mobile and desktop environment. MediXall operates in a form of reverse auction where the consumer will choose from a list of the products and or services required. Qualified and vetted suppliers will compete based on a combination of quality score, location, best price and convenience. We firmly believe that MediXall will lower costs to the patient-consumer/ buyer and healthcare industry at large.

MediXall is bringing a consumer-centric marketing model that has been successful in the retail industry to the healthcare market. This new online, easily accessible and understood auction of medical care will offer patient/consumers the opportunity to review the services offered and costs of service for desired procedures, and ultimately a large number of practitioners will participate in order to compete. One has only to look at the success of Amazon, that brought a disruptive retail platform to the retail industry; and Uber for the taxi industry, that has been valued at $68 billion to see the huge potential for growth in shareholder value. MediXalls patent-protected technology secures a strong leadership position in this market innovation.

We believe millions of healthcare providers around the world are looking for a simple, efficient and reliable way to manage their operations, specifically their patient discovery & acquisition operation. Management tasks are generally time consuming, preventing providers from focusing on delivering their core services. This results in a loss of revenue-generating opportunities, lower client satisfaction and lower client retention. We developed the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace to enable these providers to focus on delivering high-quality care to patients and be able to outsource functions that are not their core concentration. Through our integrated cloud-based platform, we enable providers to easily maximize staff efficiency, in-crease patient volume, increase their revenue, and publicize their practice  all in a cost-effective manner. We also plan to offer advanced marketing and client re-tention capabilities to help practices acquire and retain their clients, and analytics capabilities to help them improve their practice and plan for the future. At the same time, we offer consumers a single platform to discover, evaluate and book health-care services. We provide convenient one-stop-shop access to our providers medical services and products, which include the following general categories, but not limited to:

·
 Physician services including cosmetic services and surgery;
 ·
 Dental services including orthodontics, endodontics, and oral surgery, and other dental services;
 ·
 Diagnostic services including MRI, MRA, CT Scan, Stress Tests, sonograms and ultrasounds;
 ·
 Laboratory services; 
 ·
 Pharmacies, pharmaceuticals and formularies; 
 ·
 Medical supplies, medical equipment; and,
 ·
 Home healthcare services.

In addition, provider reviews on our platform can only be written by consumers who have actually used a service by a MediXaid Network Provider Member through the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace. As a result, consumers are able to access credible reviews that provide a basis for informed decisions. The net effect of the vendor- competitive model of the platform is it empowers consumers to control their healthcare based on a combination of quality score, location, price and convenience.

Division 2: MediXall Finance Group Overview

As mentioned under Milestones, prompted by the success of the joint venture between Crossroads Capital Finance Group and the MediXaid Provider Network, the company has entered into an agreement to purchase the Health Care division of Crossroads Capital Finance, and, accordingly, is setting up a MediXall Group division called MediXall Finance Group. This is the second revenue center currently generating revenue. MediXalls growing lineup of institutional and private lenders has custom-designed financing products to serve four critical needs in the healthcare sector:

1)
 Medical Procedure Loans for Healthcare Practitioners to offer their patients the option to receive care when they need it, and to make payments over time
 2)
 Cosmetic and Elective Procedure Loans through Practitioners
 
5


3)
 Commercial Loans for business expansion, equipment purchases and leases
 4)
 Medical Accounts Receivable loans to help practices bridge the gap between the time when service is rendered, and payment is received.

MediXall Finance Groups products are designed to assist practitioners and their patient/clients through each phase of their evolution, from setting up and equip-ping a state-of-the-art practice, helping patients get the care they need right now, whether medically imperative or elective, and helping practices smooth out the process of maintaining cash flow.
Division 3: MediXall Investment Group

The foundation concepts for the MediXall Platform and the Healthcare EcoSystem were developed in cooperation with the MediXall Group Chairman, Noel Guillama, MD, and strategic partner company Quantum Group, Inc. MediXall Investment Group has developed a new model for a healthcare Ecosystem hub to address the challenges and opportunities associated with the current state of Healthcare: enabling consumers to find a best match for their healthcare-related needs and associated products. The MediXall Investment Group will seek to acquire, or partner with owners of superior healthcare inventions to create mutually beneficial agreements that generate revenue through the use of patented intellectual property.

Approaching the Healthcare EcoSystem as a whole, MediXall creates, partners with, and invests in companies that embody our mission statement. Before we engage in binding agreements with a company, it must address three or more of these five objectives:

1.
 Reduce cost
 2.
 Promote better care and improves overall consumer wellness
 3.
 Create efficiencies and reduces waste and/or redundancies
 4.
 Follow the master trend in healthcare and demographics
 5.
 Remain consistent with U.S. Policies in the industry

Market Analysis: Rising Healthcare Costs 

Healthcare spending, overall, is very high in the United States, and growing. From 2005 to 2016, health care spending in the United States tripled. In 2016, it reached nearly $3.4 trillion, up 4.8 percent from 2015. That makes healthcare one of the countrys largest industries, equaling approximately17.8 percent of gross domestic product. In comparison, health care costs were $27.2 billion in 1960, just 5 percent of GDP. That translates to an annual health care cost of $10,348 per person in 2016 versus just $146 per person in 1960. Health care costs have risen faster than annual income. According to The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), U.S. health care spending is projected to reach nearly $5.5 trillion by 2025, a full 20 percent of GDP. 

Furthermore, the average insurance premium for consumers has risen 19% over the past five years, to $7,000 for single coverage in 2017, and to nearly $19,000 for family coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, only 80% of health insurance premiums go towards paying for service, while the other 20% is lost in administrative overhead. Oftentimes healthcare providers go unpaid for months, or longer  causing ever increasing costs.

Despite employers paying about three quarters of their workers premiums, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, individual workers health costs have gone up as well. In addition to premium increases, their out-of-pocket costs, which include what they spend for deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance, have risen too. Between 2005 and 2015 average out-of-pocket costs grew 66%, or more than twice the growth rate in wages during that period, according to Kaiser.

The Patients Perspective

Patients struggle to bear the high costs of health care in the United States by paying increasingly expensive insurance premiums, which can only serve as a cap on a family’s exposure to ﬁnancial ruin. Because of high annual deductibles, most patients’ day to day care is still paid out of pocket.

Since costs such as a doctor visits and many other routine visits are paid out of pocket, price comparison is increasingly important. Currently, consumers suffer from a lack of transparency, trust, and a general inability to systematically access the best health care at the most affordable price.

While the internet has increased the amount of information available to health care consumers, many self-pay consumer purchases are a result of chance, haphazard decision making, procrastination, and poor information. Moreover, many Healthcare Providers have not thought about what they would charge a cash-pay patient who pays up-front at the time of service. As a result, the self-pay consumer pays the health care provider at the providers Usual and Customary Rate, which on average is 40% more than what insurance companies pay for their insured members. This discount represents one of the largest advantages of the insurance model.

Prices for a given procedure vary widely, however, within a town, state, countrywithout necessarily any real difference in the quality of outcomes as well. Researchers for a Health Care Cost Institute study found the national average price for 242 common serviceseverything from lab tests and X-rays to more extensive procedures like hip replacements and angioplastiesvaried extensively across states as well as within metropolitan areas. For example, in Cleve-land, the average price paid for a pregnancy ultrasound was $522. But just 60 miles away in Canton, Ohio, the average price was $183, according to the study.

An Amino Study of MRI prices found that the price of an MRI can be thousands of dollars more if you go to a hospital than if you go to an imaging center, depending on your state. Although many qualify for subsidized insurance premiums, they are still required to pay their deductible up front. In 2015, the Affordable Care Act capped this at $6,500 for an individual and $13,200 for a family-potentially ruinous costs for many low to middle income Americans.

As a result, increasing numbers of patients go without insurance entirely, thinking their healthcare needs would not justify the expense of an insurance premium. Oliver Wyman found that enrollment in the healthcare exchanges decreased by 22 percent in 2016 and 2017. This population, often young and too well off to qualify for government-funded welfare programs like Medicaid, therefore neglect going to the doctor for routine visits. This represents a loss both for patients and providers.

The Providers Perspective

For health care providers, offering services to insured patients is complicated, costly and fraught with delays. As indicated above, providers customarily discount their services by an average of 40% as a result of the insurance companies bargaining positioning. Moreover, providers often must wait for months before a claim is reviewed and approved by insurance companies and they receive payment. Finally, providers must write off a large percentage of their billings due to unpaid co-pays, deductible, co-insurance, disputed billing, and other situations.

According to many providers, the wait time for payment from an insurance provider is 27-90 days on average from the time of service. The administrative burdens and payment delays often increase when government programs like Medicare and Medicaid are involved. Illinois, for example, has more than $5 billion dollars in unpaid state health insurance and $2 billion dollars in unpaid Medicaid bills to healthcare providers who in many cases have waited years to be reimbursed. The situation is so bad that many providers opt not to deal with Medicaid, turning away those most in need because they cannot afford to provide services for free. Approximately 50 percent of providers make this tough decision.

These administrative costs overburden providers as well as insurance companies. Approximately 80 percent of a healthcare insurance premium goes directly to medical services, on average. The remaining 20 percent goes to administrative costs of the insurance company.

These difficulties have led to a sharp increase of providers abandoning insurance companies in favor of cash only, concierge medicine, and other alternative business models. Many providers, however, cannot afford to completely replace their business model, which is what is often necessary to make the transition proﬁtable.

MediXall Healthcare Ecosystem: Finding the Right Solution for Patients and Providers


By delivering a solution that better connect consumers with high-quality healthcare providers and wellness services, MediXall enables our Provider Network members to engage consumers with the level of price transparency and digital convenience that they have come to expect in every other aspect of their lives.

Strategic Focus
 
Onboarding and Quality Assurance

MediXall is committed to promoting the highest level of quality care for its users. In support of this commitment, practitioners who join the MediXaid Provider Network must undergo a rigorous process called credentialing in order to be able to provide services through the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace. 

Once a health provider has requested to join our marketplace, we conduct a full credentialing process that 
evaluates the qualifications and practice history of a health provider. Credentialing involves many steps, which ensure that providers meet our stringent standards and are capable of providing MediXall users with the quality of care they have come to expect. Once a provider’s participation application is received, we verify the qualifications and practice history of a health provider. This information includes, but not limited to:

·
 All medical and postgraduate training
 ·
 Board certification in the provider’s area of specialty
 ·
 Current licensure
 ·
 Any sanctions against the provider's license
 ·
 Malpractice coverage
 ·
 Malpractice history, work history, medical history

If the provider passes all of these checks, the application is then forwarded to the MediXall Credentialing Committee for review. This committee includes healthcare providers from our provider network, along with providers from within the community. Providers who are approved by this committee become MediXall preferred providers and can begin providing services through our Healthcare Marketplace Platform.

Credentialing is a lengthy, but necessary, process to ensure that our users have access to quality healthcare providers. We expect to be capable of providing ownership disclosure on nearly all Providers. Meanwhile, the consumer on the buying side of the transaction will be protected by their aforementioned rolling encryption, uniquely coded profile and member identification for each user. 

Sales and Marketing

We deploy a direct sales approach driven by an inside sales team based in Ft Lauderdale, Florida, and Orlando, Florida. Our sales team qualifies and manages prospective and current MediXaid Network Providers, aiming to initiate, retain, and expand their use of our platform over time. Our sales team partners with the technology team to provide consultation and product demonstration to prospects to accelerate the onboarding of new subscribers. As we begin the roll out of the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace to employers, we intend to develop and expand a field sales team responsible for discovery, qualification, and account management for larger organizations.

Our marketing efforts are focused on generating awareness of our platform, creating sales leads, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of successful and vocal healthcare providers and consumers. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including search engine and email marketing, online display and print advertising, participation in trade shows, events and conferences, permission marketing, social media and media outreach, and strategic partnerships and endorsements.

Revenue Model 
 
Our revenue model is comprised of four primary components: 

Technology Fees. Revenue we receive from providers for the use of the technology, once a patient requests the appointment from that specific provider. All providers pay outstanding fees on a monthly basis to MediXall. 
Subscription and Services. With the Company soft-launching the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace in South Florida, early-adopter providers can join the platform for one year at no cost. During this time, the provider is only subject to technology fees as they accrue. We are leveraging this Provider user base and associated data to refine the app, identify what works and what does not work and offer enhancements and upgrades for Subscription fees. As we begin the broader-based market rollout of the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace, we expect subscription and services revenue will be generated primarily from sales of subscriptions and additional features for the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace. We expect most of subscription fees to be prepaid by subscribers on a monthly basis via a credit card and, to a lesser extent, billed to subscribers on an annual or quarterly basis. 
Financing Revenue. We earn financing revenue from revenue share arrangements with third-party payment processors and lenders on transactions between MediXaid Provider Network members who utilize our financing solutions and their consumers. Financing solutions offered to the MediXaid Provider Network in-clude: 1) Patient financing for healthcare practitioners to offer their patients the option to receive care when they need it, and to make payments over time, 2) Cosmetic and elective procedure financing through practitioners, 3) Commercial financing for practice expansion, equipment purchases and leases, and 4) Medical accounts receivable financing. We expect our financing revenue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue as we add new providers who utilize our financing solutions, as existing providers and consumers increase the volume of transactions that they process through our financing solutions, and as our aggregate volume of financing transactions reduces our related costs and increases margins. 
Partner Product and Services. MediXaid Provider Network members can choose to enter into a separate contract with MediXall technology partners to purchase additional features and functionalities, as well as other products and services. We receive a revenue share from these arrangements from our technology partners, which is recorded when earned. Additionally, we intend to develop the MediXall Healthcare Marketplace API, which will create a revenue stream from API platform partners for subscriber site access, data query, and consumer bookings.
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017 we employed 19 full-time employees.
