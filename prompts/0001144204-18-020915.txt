Corporate History
 
We were incorporated as Forever Zen Ltd. on March 20, 2010 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On December 13, 2013, we changed our name to NowNews Digital Media Technology Co., Ltd. and planned to enter into the business of internet media and news content. Prior to the Share Exchange described below, we were a development stage company and had not yet realized any revenues from our planned operations.
 
On November 14, 2014, we entered into and closed a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), with Worldwide Media Investments Corp., an Anguilla corporation (“Worldwide”), the shareholders of Worldwide, and NOWnews Network Co., Ltd., a Taiwan corporation (“NOWnews Network”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, (i) the Company issued an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of common stock to the shareholders of Worldwide in exchange for all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Worldwide. Worldwide, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sky Media Investments Co., Ltd. (“Sky Media”), owns 66% of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of NOWnews Network(the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Worldwide and Sky Media become our wholly owned subsidiary and NOWnews Network is now our majority owned subsidiary in which we indirectly holds 66% of the equity interest.

Principal Services
 
We generate our revenues primarily from online advertising and marketing services and news content licensing.
 
Advertising and Marketing
 
Our advertising product offerings consist of banner, button, text-link and video advertisements that appear on pages within our website, and advertising campaign design and management services. Our primary advertising and sponsorship client base for advertising and sponsorships includes international and local companies. We offer brand advertising services in display formats on our website as well as performance-based online marketing solutions, such as promoted feeds on mobile or tablet. Display advertising comprises the text, images and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including content specially formatted to be displayed on smartphones, tablets and other mobile personal digital devices.
 
We also provide advertising campaign design and management services for a fee. Our services include design and implementation of marketing and advertising projects consisting of content advertising through publishing topic news and experience articles, pop-up or embedded advertisements on our website or applications, creation of visual/mobile/audio advertisement, etc. Through these services, we help our clients establish their corporate image and brand and market their products.
 
News Content Licensing
 
We have our own team comprising journalists and editors who produce approximately 350 - 500 news articles/reports on a daily basis, covering real-time diversified news including politics, finance, life, technology, sport, entertainment, travel and others. Besides, NOWnews Network also licenses its self-created news content to major portals and corporate partners with more extensive news network, such as Yahoo Hong Kong, Yahoo Taiwan, MSN Taiwan, Yam, Sina Taiwan, Taiwan Mobile, Chunghwa Telecom, Far EasTone Telecommunications Co. Ltd., Vibo Telecom, etc.
 
Historically, we provided editing services to customers including selecting, sorting, editing news for other website operators such as Yahoo Taiwan. We ceased this service in December 2013 because this service was not profitable. In addition, we used to provide film/video editing services and licensed copyrights to a related party, Chunghwa Wideband Best Network Co., Ltd., and stopped in later 2013.
 
Seasonality
 
We have experienced seasonality in our online advertising business. Historically, the periods from May through August and from November to January have seen increase of more than 20% in advertising revenues due to the summer break and the winter holiday season. February has historically been the worst month for our advertising business as it is after the Lunar New Year holidays when advertising revenues are generally down nationwide. Past performance may not be indicative of future trends, as the mix of advertising industry sectors, which may have different seasonality factors, may shift from quarter to quarter. There is no seasonality in its licensing business.

Pursuant to the Provisions on Broadcasting and Television Program Supply, to obtain the permit to engage in broadcasting and TV program supply business, we are required to meet two criteria: (i) minimum registered capital of NT$1,200,000 and (ii) minimum office area of approximately 377square feet.

Under the Foreign Exchange Ordinance, foreign exchange refers to foreign currency, bills and marketable securities. The authority managing the administration of foreign exchange is Ministry of Finance of Republic of China, while the authority managing the practical operation of foreign exchange business is Central Bank of Republic of China. The Foreign Exchange Ordinance also specifies the allocated power of Ministry of Finance and Central Bank, respectively. To the extent that any foreign exchange receipts, payments or transactions reach the threshold of NT$500,000 ($16,869) or equivalent in foreign currency, it must be reported to the Central Bank or its designated authorities. Upon incurrence of any of the following events, the State Council of Republic of China may determine and announce that for a period of time, to close the foreign exchange market, suspend or restrict all or partial foreign exchange payment, order a mandatory sale or deposit of all or partial foreign exchange into a designed bank, or dispose in any other manner as it deems necessary:
 
the disorder in domestic or international economy to the detriment of the stability of Taiwan’s economy; or Taiwan suffers serious trade deficit.
 
Tax
 
The current principal regulations governing tax in Taiwan include the following:
 
Income Tax Law, latest amended on February 7, 2018;
 The Implementation Rules of Income Tax Law, latest amended on September 30, 2014;
 Value-Added and Non-Value-Added Business Tax Law, latest amended on June 14, 2017; and
 The Implementation Rules of Value-Added and Non-Value-Added Business Tax Law, latest amended on May 1, 2017.
 
Under the Income Tax Law, there are two kinds of income tax, comprehensive income tax for individuals and income tax for enterprises operating for profit, respectively.
 
Individuals who have income with a source within Taiwan must pay comprehensive income tax on their income sourced within Taiwan; while non-resident individuals having income with a source within Taiwan, except otherwise provided in the Income Tax Law, shall pay tax based on the amount attributable to the sources of their income.
 
The enterprise with head office located in Taiwan shall pay profit-seeking income tax on its global income both within and outside Taiwan; while the enterprises with head office outside Taiwan shall only pay profit-seeking income tax on its business income sourced from within Taiwan.

The individual comprehensive income tax exemption threshold is NT$60,000 ($2,024) per person per year. Any income beyond such exemption threshold is subject to a progressive tax rate ranging from 5% to 40%.
 
With respect to enterprises operating for profit, the exemption threshold is NT$120,000 ($4,048). Any income beyond such exemption threshold is subject to 20% tax rate on its taxable income.

Enforceability of Judgments in Taiwan
 
All of our directors and executive officers named in this report are residents of Taiwan and substantially all of our assets and the assets of those persons are located in Taiwan. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon us or those persons outside of Taiwan, or to enforce against them judgments obtained in courts outside of Taiwan. Any final judgment obtained against us in any court other than the courts of the Republic of China in connection with any legal suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to our securities will be enforced by the courts of the Republic of China without further review of the merits only if the court of the Republic of China in which enforcement is sought is satisfied that:
 

9
-

 

the court rendering the judgment has jurisdiction over the subject matter according to the laws of the Republic of China;
 
the judgment and the court procedure resulting in the judgment are not contrary to the public order or good morals of the Republic of China;
 
if the judgment was rendered by default by the court rendering the judgment, we, or our officers and directors, were duly served within a reasonable period of time in accordance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction of the court or process was served on us with judicial assistance of the Republic of China; and
 
judgments at the courts of the Republic of China are recognized and enforceable in the court rendering the judgment on a reciprocal basis.
 
A party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in the Republic of China would be required to obtain foreign exchange approval from the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) for the payment out of Taiwan of any amounts recovered in connection with the judgment denominated in a currency other than NT dollars if a conversion from NT dollars to a foreign currency is involved.
 
Market Opportunities
 
Our current primary focus is on the Taiwan market. The success of our business is tied to the size and vitality of Taiwan’s economy. According to the International Monetary Fund, Taiwan’s gross domestic product in 2017 grew 2.84% year over year to $519.15 billion.
 
Taiwan has one of the most advanced telecommunications networks in Asia. With excellent telecommunications infrastructure in place and the innovative use of breakthrough information technologies, Taiwan continues to be well placed to drive both mobile and data communications services.
 
Competition
 
The market for Web sites offering online content and services targeting the global Chinese community is competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future. Many of the companies attempting to address this market offer portal, content and e-commerce services. The following table lists the Chinese-language Web sites that we believe are currently our primary competitors in Taiwan:
 
udn.com
 appledaily.com.tw
 Chinatimes.com
 ltn.com.tw
 ettoday.net
 
As internet usage in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (collectively, the “Greater China”) increases and the Greater China market becomes more attractive to advertisers and for conducting fee-based services, large global competitors, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, Twitter, Line, Kakao and WhatsApp, may increasingly focus their resources on the Greater China market. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in competing against the established and emerging competitors in the market. The increased competition could result in reduced traffic, loss of market share and revenues, and lower profit margins.
 
Our ability to compete successfully depends on many factors, including the quality of our content, the breadth, depth and ease of use of our services, our sales and marketing efforts and the performance of our technology.

Competitive Strength
 
We provide online content and services for the global Chinese community with a focus on Taiwan, including but not limited to informational features, social media and social networking services as well as other fee-based services. This industry can be characterized as highly competitive and rapidly changing due to the fast growing market demand. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and current and new competitors can launch new websites or services at a relatively low cost. Many companies offer various content and services targeting this community that compete with us. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources, a longer history of providing online services, a larger and more active user base, more established brand names and currently offer a greater breadth of products that may be more popular than our online offerings. However, we believe that we possess the following competitive strengths that enable us to compete effectively:
 
We have an outstanding editorial team which produces hundreds of news on a daily basis, covering real-time diversified news including politics, finance, life, technology, sport, entertainment, travel and others. Besides, we license our self-created news content to major portals and corporate partners with a stable and extensive news network. We believe this is very critical to attract readers and increase traffic volume of our website.
 
We have been focusing on new media operations and interaction with its members and fans. We believe we are the first news media which opened official accounts on LINE and WeChat, two very popular mobile messengers in Asia and created NOWnews Network fan group on Facebook.
 
With the growing popularity of mobile devices, we are the first to develop applications on mobile devices offering users real-time news anywhere at any time. The current daily traffic on our website exceeds 14 million and is mobile website has a daily traffic volume of approximately 4 million. 
 
We have won many awards and is highly recognized and rated among our peers. Recognition and awards include:
 

· | 10th among the top 100 websites in Taiwan in the survey conducted by comScore
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 18th on the “Top 100 Hottest Websites in Taiwan” and first among the original news websites by Digital Times in 2014

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The 13th Cross-Strait News Reporting Award – Citizen News

--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have a very large member base, which includes approximately 430,000 Facebook fans and 840,000 LINE subscribers and 100,000 WeChat subscribers. We believe this member base will keep increasing and we will leverage this membership base to expand our business. PRC implements strict control over the media. However, we are the only Taiwan internet media to which the PRC residents have full access – this, we believe, provides us with access to a very large potential reader base and tremendous business opportunities. Currently, approximately 9% of our traffic is from the PRC. Through our platform, we can build a cross-strait service system where we can promote Taiwan’s services or products to readers in the PRC. However, PRC regulatory authorities may find the contents on our website/mobile applications objectionable and block users in China from accessing our website and/or mobile applications.
 
Technology Infrastructure
 
Our operating infrastructure is designed to serve and deliver hundreds of millions of page views a day to our users. This scalable infrastructure allows our users to access our products and services quickly and efficiently, regardless of their geographical location. Our infrastructure is also designed to provide high-speed access by forwarding queries to our Web hosting sites with greater resources or lower loads. Our Web pages are generated, served and cached by servers hosted at various co-location Web hosting sites in Taiwan and the United States.

--

 

Our servers run on our own web-based platforms. These servers are maintained at Amazon in the United States and our offices in Taiwan. We believe that our hosting partners provide significant operating advantages, including an enhanced ability to protect our systems from power loss, break-ins and other potential external causes of service interruption. They provide continuous customer service, multiple connections to the Internet and a continuous power supply to our systems. In addition, we conduct online monitoring of all our systems for accessibility, load, system resources, network- server intrusion and timeliness of content.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We enhance our brand images and visibility through participating in various public events, exchanging resources with other companies, and establishing partnership with other media companies. In addition, we focus on keyword marketing and search engine optimizing to increase the search ranking of our news content.
Research and Development
 
Currently, we focus on (i) developing the Drupal platform to host our website and (ii) using Drupal to build daily news from personal blogs and company applications. Drupal is an open source content management platform powering millions of websites and applications. It’s built, used, and supported by an active and diverse community of people around the world and has thousands of add-on modules and designs available for us to build and improve our website. 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. From time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.
 
In addition, third parties may initiate litigation against us alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. In the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. In addition, even if we are able to license the infringed or similar technology, license fees could be substantial and may adversely affect our results of operations.

We have the following patents as of the date of this report:

NOTE 2: GOING CONCERN
 
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred significant losses and has not demonstrated the ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy its liabilities and sustain operations. The Company had accumulated deficits of $11,869,788 and $7,932,295, and stockholders’ deficits of $2,115,848 and $1,380,173 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The net losses attributable to common stockholders of $3,937,493 and $3,532,106 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, current liabilities exceed current assets by $1,837,035 and $858,428 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing significant working capital deficits. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.  If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Management’s Plan to Continue as a Going Concern
 
In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to obtain such resources for the Company include (1) obtaining capital from the sale of its equity securities, (2) sales of the Company’s services, (3) short-term and long-term borrowings from banks, and (4) short-term borrowings from stockholders or other related party(ies) when needed. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.
 
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually to secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations.
 
NOTE 3: BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of presentation:
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The Company and Worldwide have recast prior period financial statements to reflect the conveyance of NOWnews Network to Sky Media as if the restructuring transaction had occurred as of January 1, 2014. All significant intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated. The nature of and effects on earnings per share (EPS) of nonrecurring intra-entity transactions involving long-term assets and liabilities is not required to be eliminated and EPS amounts have been recast to include the earnings (or losses) of the transferred net assets.
 
The functional currency of NOWnews Network and NOWnews International is the New Taiwan dollars, however the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated and presented in United States Dollars ($). In the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes, “$”, “US$” and “U.S. dollars” mean United States dollars, and “NT$” and “NT dollars” mean New Taiwan dollars.
 
Use of estimates and assumptions:
 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those results. The most significant estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements include depreciation, useful lives of property and equipment, deferred income taxes, useful life of intangible assets and contingencies. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary.
 
Cash and cash equivalents:
 
The Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit and other highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has uninsured deposits in banks of $41,540 and $122,508, respectively.

Accounts receivable:
 
The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company assessed the allowance for doubtful accounts of $10,345 and $9,464, respectively.
 
Property and equipment:
 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Gains or losses on disposals are reflected as gain or loss in the year of disposal. The cost of improvements that extends the life of property and equipment are capitalized. These capitalized costs may include structural improvements, equipment, and fixtures. All ordinary repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
 
Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or lease term as follows:
 

Electronic Equipment | 3 to 5 years 
-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------
Computer Equipment | 5 years 
Office Equipment and Furniture | 5 years 
Leasehold Improvement | Lesser of term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets

 
Long-lived assets:
 
The Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 360 (ASC 360), “Property, Plant, and Equipment” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 360, at least on an annual basis. ASC 360 requires the impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for the cost of disposal.
 
Intangible assets:
 
Intangible assets consist of software, trademark, and copyrights (see Note 6). At least annually, the Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Estimating future cash flows related to an intangible asset involves significant estimates and assumptions. If the Company’s assumptions are not correct, there could be an impairment loss or, in the case of a change in the estimated useful life of the asset, a change in amortization expense. There was no impairment of intangible assets as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Leases:
 
Lease agreements are evaluated to determine if they are capital leases meeting any of the following criteria at inception: (a) Transfer of ownership; (b) Bargain purchase option; (c) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property; (d) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at lease inception over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor.
 
If at its inception a lease meets any of the four lease criteria above, the lease is classified by the lessee as a capital lease; and if none of the four criteria are met, the lease is classified by the lessee as an operating lease.
 
Fair Value Measurements:
 
FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements” defines fair value for certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It requires that an entity measure its financial instruments to base fair value on exit price, maximize the use of observable units and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to determine the exit price. It establishes a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. This hierarchy increases the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and related disclosures by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows:

· | Level 1 – Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Valuation of these instruments does not require a high degree of judgment as the valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly available. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
· | Level 3 – Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and not corroborated by market data. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

 
The carrying values of certain assets and liabilities of the Company, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, due from related parties, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, due to shareholders, and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities.
 
Revenue recognition:
 
Product and service revenue is recognized when the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or the service has been performed, (iii) the Company’s price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured.  Payments received before satisfaction of all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue. The Company recognizes revenue for product sales upon transfer of title to the customer.  The Company recognizes revenue for services upon performance of the service.  Customer purchase orders and/or contracts will generally be used to determine the existence of an arrangement.  Shipping documents and the completion of any customer acceptance requirements, when applicable, will be used to verify product delivery or that services have been rendered.  The Company will assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. The Company will record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded.  These estimates will be based on industry-based historical data, historical sales returns, if any, analysis of credit memo data, and other factors known at the time.

Post-retirement and post-employment benefits:
 
NOWnews Network adopted the government mandated defined contribution plan pursuant to the Labor Pension Act (the “Act”) in Taiwan. Such labor regulations require that the rate of contribution made by an employer to the Labor Pension Fund per month shall not be less than 6% of the worker's monthly salaries. Pursuant to the Act, NOWnews Network makes monthly contribution equal to 6% of employees’ salaries to the employees’ pension fund. NOWnews Network has no legal obligation for the benefits beyond the contributions made. The total amounts for such employee benefits, which were expensed as incurred, were $118,375 and $78,327 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Other than the above, the Company does not provide any other post-retirement or post-employment benefits.
 
Stock-based Compensation:
 
The Company measures expense associated with all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and recognizes such expense in the consolidated financial statements on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period in accordance with ASC Topic 718 “Compensation-Stock Compensation”. Total employee stock-based compensation expenses were $$1,444,250 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
The Company accounted for stock-based compensation to non-employees in accordance with ASC Topic 505-50 “Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees” which requires that the cost of services received from non-employees is measured at fair value at the earlier of the performance commitment date or the date service is completed and recognized over the period the service is provided. Total non-employee stock-based compensation expenses were $795,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Foreign currency translation:
 
The Company uses the United States dollar ("U.S. dollars") for financial reporting purposes. The Company maintains the books and records in its functional currency, being the primary currency of the economic environment in which its operations are conducted. For reporting purpose, the Company translates the assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates, and the statements of income are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting periods. Gain or loss on foreign currency transactions are reflected on the income statement. Gain or loss on financial statement translation from foreign currency are recorded as a separate component in the equity section of the balance sheet and is included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income. The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries in Taiwan is New Taiwan Dollars.
 
Statement of cash flows:
 
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 230, “Statement of Cash Flows,” cash flows from the Company’s operations are calculated based upon the local currencies, and translated to the reporting currency using an average foreign exchange rate for the reporting period. As a result, amounts related to changes in assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheets.
 
Income taxes:
 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The deferred income tax assets were $0 as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
The Company applied the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, “Accounting For Uncertainty In Income Taxes”, which provides clarification related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the Company’s liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material to the Company’s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations for the given period. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, management considered that the Company had no uncertain tax positions, and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future.
 
The Company is subject to the tax authority in Taiwan for years since incorporated.
 
Earnings (Losses) per share (EPS):
 
Earnings (losses) per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260. Basic earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (losses) per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock instruments were converted or exercised. Options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period if the average stock price for the period is greater than the exercise price of the warrants and options. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, no options or warrants were issued or outstanding.

Discontinued operations
 
Results of the Company’s discontinued entity have been presented in discontinued operations in the financial statements. See Note 1 and Note 12 for additional information.
 
Reclassifications:
 
Certain classifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassification had no impact on previously reported net loss or accumulated deficit.
 
Recent accounting pronouncements:
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases.” The core principle of the ASU is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from its leases other than those that meet the definition of a short-term lease. The ASU requires extensive qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including with respect to significant judgments made by management. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-13, in September 2017 and ASU No. 2018-01, in January 2018, which amends and clarifies ASU 2016-02. The ASU will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019, including interim periods in the fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and disclosures.
 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) . In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing . In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting . In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In September 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Leases (Topic 840), and Leases (Topic 842). These amendments provide additional clarification and implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The amendments in ASU 2016-08 clarify how an entity should identify the specified good or service for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. ASU 2016-10 clarifies the following two aspects of ASU 2014-09: identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance. ASU 2016-11 rescinds several SEC Staff Announcements that are codified in Topic 605, including, among other items, guidance relating to accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer, as well as accounting for shipping and handling fees and freight services. ASU 2016-12 provides clarification to Topic 606 on how to assess collectability, present sales tax, treat noncash consideration, and account for completed and modified contracts at the time of transition. ASU 2016-12 clarifies that an entity retrospectively applying the guidance in Topic 606 is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change in the period of adoption. Additionally, ASU 2016-20 clarifies certain narrow aspects within Topic 606 including its scope, contract cost accounting, and disclosures. The new guidance requires enhanced disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and significant judgments in measurement and recognition. The effective date and transition requirements for these amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09, which is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the overall impact that ASU 2014-09 and its related amendments will have on the Company’s financial statements.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB 118”), which provides guidance on accounting for tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provision of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act. While the Company is able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of the reduction in corporate rate and the deemed repatriation transition tax, the final impact of the Tax Act may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in our interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by the I.R.S., and actions we may take. The Company is continuing to gather additional information to determine the final impact.
 
In February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-02 (ASU 2018-02), Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). The guidance in ASU 2018-02 allows an entity to elect to reclassify the stranded tax effects related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) of 2017 from accumulated other comprehensive income into retained earnings. ASU 2018-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 8: INCOME TAX
 
United States
 
The Company is incorporated in the United States of America and is subject to United States federal taxation. No provisions for income taxes have been made as the Company has no taxable income for the period. The applicable income tax rate for the Company was 35% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. No tax benefit has been realized since a 100 % valuation allowance has offset deferred tax asset resulting from the net operating losses.
 
On December 22, 2017 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. Among the significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Tax Act lowers the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate (“Federal Tax Rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The 21% Federal Tax Rate will apply to earnings reported for the full 2018 fiscal year. In addition, the Company must re-measure its net deferred tax assets and liabilities using the Federal Tax Rate that will apply when these amounts are expected to reverse. As of December 31, 2017, the Company can determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of tax reform and is recording that estimate as a provisional amount. The provisional remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and allowance valuation of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 resulted in a net effect of $0 discrete tax expenses (benefit) which lowered the effective tax rate by 13% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The provisional remeasurement amount is anticipated to change as data becomes available allowing more accurate scheduling of the deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily related to net operating loss carryover.
 
Anguilla
 
Worldwide Media Investments Corp. and Sky Media are incorporated in Anguilla, which does not tax income.
 
Seychelles
 
Dawnrain Media Co., Ltd., New Taoyard Cultural Transmission Co., Ltd., and Asia Well Ltd. are incorporated in Seychelles, which does not tax income.
 
Taiwan
 
NOWnews Network and NOWnews International are incorporated in Taiwan. The Taiwan Income Tax Law imposes a unified enterprise income tax rate of 20% on all enterprises with taxable income greater than approximately $4,048 (NT$120,000). No income tax liabilities existed as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 due to the Company’s continuing operating losses.
 
Provision for income tax consists of the following:

Significant components of the Company’s deferred taxes as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
 

 | December 31, | | | December 31, | 
---------------------------------+--------------+------------+---+--------------+--
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
Deferred tax assets: | | | | | | |

Less: Valuation allowance | | (4,564,623 | ) | | | (3,170,956 | )
Deferred tax assets, net | $ | - | | | $ | - | 

 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating losses and temporary differences become deductible. Management considered projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company accrued 100% valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets based on the assessment of the probability of future realization.
 
NOTE 9: STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company was authorized to issue a total of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share.
 
On June 4, 2013, Worldwide issued 17,000,000 common shares to Mr. Alan Chen as founder’s shares for no consideration exchanged. As a result, a discount on capital of $17,000,000 was recorded.
