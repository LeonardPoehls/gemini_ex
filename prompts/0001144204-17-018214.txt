ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Inventergy Global, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an intellectual property (“IP”) investment and licensing company that helps technology-leading corporations attain greater value from their IP assets in support of their business objectives and corporate brands.  Our original monetization and licensing business was enhanced in April 2016, when the Company formed Inventergy Innovations, LLC (“Inventergy Innovations”) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
The Company has two distinct business execution approaches to achieve monetization of IP:
 

· | Inventergy Innovations: Commercialization of a broad range of intellectual assets and innovations to which Inventergy Innovations obtains exclusive rights through agreements with external partners, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Patent Residual Interest Program (“PRIP”) (defined below): Monetization through enforcement of the Company’s approximately 740 telecommunications patents which will be part of the PRIP, as more fully explained below. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inventergy Innovations
 
Inventergy Innovations was formed to commercialize a broad range of intellectual assets and innovations through partnerships with third parties who have developed or obtained IP they wish to monetize. To date, Inventergy Innovations has entered into agreements with seven companies, who each owns unique technology and intellectual property which we believe has potentially significant market opportunities. In each of these engagements, Inventergy Innovations has obtained rights to the commercialization of some or all of the technology and intellectual property owned by these firms and will share the proceeds of the commercialization efforts with these companies. Each engagement is unique with some involving transfer of ownership of the assets to Inventergy Innovations and/or modest initial or ongoing progress payments by Inventergy Innovations. The objective of the Inventergy Innovations technology commercialization model is to obtain initial revenue within a 12- to 18-month period as measured from the commencement of each engagement. We believe this initiative expands the Company’s revenue opportunity and is a business model with lower up-front capital outlays and lower operating costs relative to each revenue opportunity.
Patent Residual Interest Program
 
In December 2016, we entered into a restructuring agreement (the “Restructuring Agreement”) with DBD Credit Funding, LLC (“DBD”) and CF DB EZ LLC (the "Managing Member"), which relates to the 740 telecommunications patents (“the Patents”) we acquired from Panasonic Corp. (“Panasonic”), Nokia Corporation (“Nokia”) and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd (“Huawei”). Pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement, following our receipt of stockholder approval at a special meeting of stockholders on March 8, 2017, the Company will be contributing the Patents to INVT SPE LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“INVT SPE”). This entity is controlled by the Managing Member, who as managing member of INVT SPE has sole discretion to make any and all decisions relating to the Patents and related monetization activities (excluding future acquired patents related to Inventergy Innovations, and related monetization activities), including the right to license, sell or sue unauthorized users of the Patents (the “Monetization Activities”).
 
The Restructuring Agreement also modified the revenue share provided for in the Revenue Sharing and Note Purchase Agreement, as amended, such that all proceeds from the Monetization Activities will be applied as follows: (i) first, to pay for certain third party expenses incurred by the Company, the Managing Member or third party brokers in relation to the Monetization Activities, (ii) second, to pay up to $2.2 million of the Company’s outstanding principal debt to Nokia Corporation (“Nokia”) in the event any Monetization Activity is directly attributable to the Company’s Nokia patent portfolio, (iii) third, if a Monetization Activity triggers a payment with respect to a retained interest owed to a prior owner under agreements with Panasonic Corporation or Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., payment will be made to such prior owner, as required, (iv) fourth, to the Managing Member until the Managing Member has received (x) reimbursement of any amounts advanced by the Managing Member pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement plus 20% annual interest on such advances plus (y) $30.5 million less any amounts paid to the Managing Member for the Note Obligations under the Revenue Sharing and Note Purchase Agreement after December 22, 2016, and (v) fifth, after all of the foregoing payment obligations are satisfied, 70% to the Managing Member and 30% to the Company. Once the Patents have been assigned to INVT SPE (which is expected to occur by the end of April 2017), the Company’s note obligations to the Managing Member will be extinguished and the Company will be relieved of any scheduled amortization payments (instead, payments to the Managing Member will only be required out of the Monetization Revenues), the prior liquidity covenant will no longer apply, and the Company will be relieved from any further responsibility to maintain the Patents retroactive to December 22, 2016. We believe the effects of the Restructuring Agreement will enable us to decrease expenses by approximately $1.3 million per quarter. The ongoing maintenance of INVT SPE and the monetization of the Patents thereunder, in which Inventergy may share subsequent net revenues as outlined above, is hereafter referred to as the Patent Residual Interest Program (“PRIP”).

Description of the Patents Which Will Be Part of the PRIP


Industry Overview
 
According to data from Ocean Tomo, an intellectual property merchant bank, 87% of the value of companies in the S&P 500 in 2015 was based in intangible assets. In many cases, product and service revenue based on patent assets can leave substantial amounts of untapped value in a company’s IP, either because the IP is in areas that are no longer as strategically important to the IP holder or it is too time-consuming for the asset holders to pursue. As a result, companies may not realize appropriate value from the results of their investments in research and development (“R&D”). In addition, many companies cannot capture the full value of the IP assets themselves as they do not possess the necessary resources and personnel or because the pursuit of additional value involves a higher degree of risk than may be acceptable to the IP holder.
Industry Focus
 
The Patents cover technology in the telecommunications industry in the following segments: (a) core network infrastructure (IP Multimedia Subsystems -IMS and Voice over IP -VOIP) and (b) mobile broadband communications (3G & 4G protocols -WCDMA/HSPA/LTE). An overview of the telecommunications industry and the Patents are described in more detail below.

General Perspectives on the Telecommunication Industry
 
The telecommunications industry is global in nature and the technologies deployed are largely defined and developed by cooperative standard-setting “working groups” established between the various market participants. One such body is “3GPP”, or 3rd Generation Partnership Project, which is a collaboration among groups of telecom associations which cover radio, core network and service architecture technologies.
 
A number of other voluntary standard setting bodies exist, with the overall objective to ensure interoperability between networks and devices. According to the Global mobile Suppliers Association (“GSA”) organization (a 3GPP industry organization), in the first quarter of 2016 there were 7.42 billion subscriptions globally using 3GPP systems (covering 2G -GSM, 3G-WCDMA & HSPA, and 4G-LTE protocols). This included 2.02 billion 3G and 1.29 billion 4G subscribers.
 
From an intellectual property commercialization perspective, the Company believes that the continued development and deployment of standards-compliant telecommunications equipment and systems, creates large, global addressable markets wherein market participants must comply with both declared and de facto industry standards in order to remain competitive. In many cases, these providers may not have developed the standards themselves nor do they own or have licensed key patents that relate to these standards. In addition, in this highly competitive industry, the Company believes market participants will also race to adopt key improvements above and in addition to standards-based technology.
 
The Company believes that the continued and accelerated deployment, as well as the continuous upgrading of technologies that can deliver richer content to mobile devices, faster and more reliable connections, quicker data speeds and more services delivered over networks, both fixed and mobile, present significant opportunities for the Company. These trends accelerate the need for IMS and 3G & 4G technologies and protocols – areas which are covered by the Patents.
 
The IMS and VOIP Segment – The primary focus of the Huawei and Nokia portfolios
 
IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is an architectural framework for delivering IP multimedia services and voice applications from wireless and wireline devices. It was originally designed by 3GPP. IMS is intended to aid the access of multimedia and voice applications from wireless and wire line terminals, to help establish fixed-mobile convergence.
 
IMS technology is already deployed by more than 100 service providers around the world as well as through cable companies to offer services such as the popular “bundles” of voice, TV and Internet. A driving force behind the deployment of LTE (Long-Term Evolution) among service providers is the ability to offer Voice over LTE (VoLTE). The Company estimates based on data from Infonetics (published in their first quarter 2016 report) and internal analysis that the overall size of this market related to the service provider segment, which could benefit from the Company’s patented technologies, is $25-$30 billion cumulative over the next five years (2017 – 2021).
 
VOIP solutions are also extensively deployed in the corporate sector as companies are addressing the needs of an increasingly mobile workforce through so-called “unified communications” offerings that packet data networks help enable.
 
The Mobile Broadband Infrastructure Segment – The primary focus of the Panasonic portfolio
 
Mobile broadband is a term that encompasses 2G, 3G and 4G cellular technologies based on standards that are developed and managed by the 3GPP organization and covers the radio, core network and service architectures that enable broadband communication between base stations and devices (such as cell phones and tablets, wireless enabled computers).

In the “Ericsson Mobility Report” from November 2016, Ericsson estimates the 3G and 4G mobile broadband subscription market will grow 5% annually from 2016-2022 for 3G and 20% for 4G (LTE). By the end of 2022, Ericsson estimates there will be a total of 8.9 billion mobile subscriptions, including 4.6 billion LTE and 2.8 billion 3G subscriptions. 
 
In North America, the 3G/LTE share of mobile subscriptions is approximately 90% per the Ericsson November 2016 mobility report. In Western Europe the share is currently approximately 85%, and is expected to grow to 98% by 2022 according to Ericsson. In the Asia Pacific region, the 3G/LTE share is currently approximately 50% and is expected to grow to 85% by 2022, according to the same report. Recent GSA data shows that 7,037 user devices have been launched from 517 suppliers as of January 2017, an increase of over 2,600 devices since February 2015. According to the same report, 91% of all LTE devices also support 3G technology. 
 
Asset Portfolios 
 
Three distinct patent portfolios were previously acquired by the Company and will be transferred to INVT SPE under the PRIP. They are the IMS, VOIP and Mobile Broadband portfolios and are further described below.


IMS and VOIP portfolios
 
Two of the portfolios, the IMS and VOIP portfolios, are complementary and were originally acquired from telecommunication industry leaders Huawei and Nokia. These two portfolios currently total approximately 297 patents including approximately 118 patents considered relevant to standards.
 
The portfolios cover the core network of the so-called “Next Generation Networks” enabling such functionality as Mobile Video delivery and Mobile High Definition Audio as well as enabling services like “triple play” (phone, television and data) offered by fixed line/cable operators and enterprise VOIP solutions.
 
The IMS and VOIP portions of the Patents cover a broad range of functional aspects, including advanced call features, network security, interoperability, system performance and network reliability.
 
The Company believes the portfolios are particularly relevant as mobile network operators, cable operators and equipment manufacturers roll out new features and content rich services for both mobile and fixed networks. The Company has identified over 125 companies within four primary licensee market segments, namely, IMS systems, enterprise networking equipment (VOIP), legacy mobile systems and telecommunications service providers that may be approached to monetize the IMS Patents. Currently there are more than 100 mobile network operators worldwide offering services based on the IMS standard and most cable companies that already offer “triple play bundles” do this on the IMS standard, so use of IMS is reasonably expected to increase substantially. The Company also estimates that there are already about 30 equipment manufacturers offering solutions relevant to this patent portfolio, and the Company previously closed a license with a mid-tier equipment manufacturer.
 
Mobile Broadband, (3G, 4G/LTE Portfolio)
 
Panasonic is among the most prolific patent filers and patent owners in the world. According to a report from the World Intellectual Property Organization, Panasonic was the number one filer of patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) in the world in 2013. In that same year, Panasonic was issued the 6th most patents in the United States according to IFI Claims. Panasonic has since moved out of several business areas and divested many businesses and patents over the past few years.
 
One such technology area is 3G (WCDMA & HSPA) and 4G (LTE) mobile infrastructure, where Panasonic, through its relationship with NTT Docomo (a leading Japanese mobile operator), was an early innovator and pioneer. The Company worked with Panasonic to select a comprehensive portfolio of patent assets currently totaling 443 in the 3G and 4G technology domains. Under the terms of the Company’s Patent Purchase Agreement with Panasonic, as amended (the “Panasonic Agreement”), the Company acquired full ownership of the portfolio including the right to past damages and has the sole right to determine the best strategy to derive value from the portfolio. This portfolio, along with the right to determine best value creation strategies, will be transferred to INVT SPE under the PRIP in April 2017.

The portfolio consists of approximately 341 3G patent assets and 246 4G patent assets. Approximately 181 of the patent assets are potentially standards relevant, which means that such patents may be infringed upon by companies, end-users or others that adhere to the optional or mandatory features of one or more operating standards adopted by industry, governmental or other organizations operating in the telecommunications industry. The main technical focus of the portfolio concerns base station equipment communication with mobile devices, specifically the radio aspects of such communications. The 3G/4G standards are widely adopted by telecom operators, infrastructure manufacturers and mobile device manufacturers around the world as the enabling standard for mobile broadband. According to data from GSA as of August 2016, there were 3.32 billion mobile broadband (3G/4G) subscriptions worldwide, including 1.3 billion LTE subscriptions. In the November 2016 Mobility Report, Ericsson forecasts that by 2022 there will be 4.6 billion LTE mobile subscriptions and 2.8 billion 3G mobile subscriptions for a total of 7.4 billion mobile subscriptions with relevance to the Panasonic portfolio.
 
The Company views the Panasonic portfolio as complementary to the Huawei and Nokia IMS portfolios where, even though a few of the target licensee companies may be the same, the relevant revenue streams are different. The Company believes that such complementary coverage may offer operational and marketing efficiencies.
 
Overview of the Patents


The Company originally acquired an aggregate of approximately 740 currently active patents and patent applications from Huawei, Nokia, and Panasonic outright, including the general right to recover damages for past infringement. In June 2015, the Company sold 26 patents in a commercial transaction. Approximately 25 patents and patent applications (including seven US and 18 non-US patents) have expired and no patent applications have been denied. The 740 active patents have an average remaining life of 6.3 years. Approximately 299 of the active patents are potentially standards relevant and the overall portfolio is subject to limited prior license encumbrances.

RE: Recently Expired
 
Portfolio Prosecution
 
To date, the Company has spent significant resources enhancing portfolio value through patent prosecution. This is the process of responding to USPTO actions which challenge or request information regarding pending patents to allow the patents to be granted and the process of broadening a portfolio through patent continuations, divisionals and reissues. Through the prosecution process, the patent portfolio can be fine-tuned for relevancy and clarity. Portfolio enhancement through patent prosecution requires substantial technical and legal expertise. Subsequent to the establishment of INVT SPE under the PRIP, these activities will be directed and enforced by the Managing Member through INVT SPE.

eOn Communications Systems, Inc.
 
eOn Communications Systems, Inc. (“ECS”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company which provides sales, marketing and technical support services to partners in the security products and services industry. The Company acquired ECS as part of a merger in June 2014.
Competition
 
The Company faces significant competition from others seeking to acquire and monetize intellectual property assets, including competitors seeking to acquire the same or similar patents and technologies that we may try to acquire. Other companies may develop competing technologies that offer better or less expensive alternatives to patented technologies that the Company may acquire and/or license. In addition, many potential competitors may have significantly greater resources than the resources the Company possesses. Technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors could render obsolete and/or uneconomical certain of the technologies owned or controlled by us.
 
Entities such as Intellectual Ventures Management, LLC, Acacia Research Corporation, InterDigital, Inc., Rambus, Inc., Marathon Patent Group, Spherix, Inc., Tessera Technologies, Inc., Vringo, Inc., VirnetX Holding Corporation, Wi-LAN Inc. and others presently market themselves as being in the business of creating, acquiring, licensing or leveraging the value of intellectual property assets. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial resources than we do.
 
Employees
 
As of March 27, 2017, the Company had three full-time employees. None of the Company’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and the Company believes its employee relations to be good.
 
The Company uses the services of various consultants and contractors to manage its business, technical, accounting and legal operations. The Company believes selective use of such consultants allows it to achieve its business objectives in a flexible, cost-effective manner.
