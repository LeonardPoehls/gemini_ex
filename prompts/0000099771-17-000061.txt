Los Alamos National Bank
 
General. The Bank is a national banking association founded in 1963 by local investors to provide convenient, full-service banking to the unique scientific community that developed around the Los Alamos National Laboratory (the "Laboratory").  The Laboratory is a pre-eminent research facility for scientific and technological development in numerous scientific fields.  As of December 31, 2016, the Laboratory employed (directly and indirectly) approximately 10,500 people, making it the largest employer in Los Alamos County.  The Laboratory is the cornerstone of the community and has attracted numerous other scientific business to the area.
 
The Bank is a full-service commercial banking institution with seven bank offices in Los Alamos, White Rock, Santa Fe, and Albuquerque, New Mexico and is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC").
 
The Bank is the sole member of Triscensions ABQ, LLC, a New Mexico limited liability company, and the sole member of FNM Investment Fund IV, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company ("FNM Investment Fund IV").  The Bank is also a member of Cottonwood Technology Group, LLC ("Cottonwood"), a management consulting and counseling company for technology startup companies, which is also designed to manage venture capital funds. FNM Investment Fund IV is a member of Finance New Mexico—Investor Series IV, LLC, a New Mexico Limited Liability Company ("FNM CDE IV"), an entity created by the Bank to fund loans and investments in a New Market Tax Credit project.  The Bank is also the sole stockholder of TCC Advisors Corporation ("TCC Advisors").  Substantially all of the assets of TCC Advisors were sold in January 2015. Trinity is in the process of dissolving this entity.
 
In February 2006, TCC Funds, a Delaware statutory trust was created with Trinity as its sponsor, to allow for the creation of a mutual fund. TCC Funds was dissolved in January 2017. In August 2008, the Bank invested in Cottonwood. Cottonwood assists in the management of, and counsels, startup companies involved in technology transfer from research institutions in New Mexico, as well as establishing and managing venture funds. Additionally, the Bank is participating in a venture capital fund managed by Cottonwood.  In 2009, the Bank created FNM Investment Fund IV to acquire a 99.99% interest in FNM CDE IV. Both of these entities were created for the sole purpose of funding loans to, and investments in, a New Market Tax Credit project located in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Bank initially formed LANB Investment Advisors in October 2012 to house a Registered Investment Advisor as part of its Trust and Investment Department operations. This entity was dissolved in November 2016.
 
Products and Services. The Bank provides a full range of financial services for deposit customers and lends money to creditworthy borrowers at competitive interest rates.  The Bank's products include certificates of deposit, checking and saving accounts, on-line banking, Individual Retirement Accounts, loans, mortgage loan servicing, trust and investment services, international services and safe deposit boxes.  These business activities make up the Bank's three key processes: investment of funds, generation of funds and service-for-fee income.  The profitability of operations depends primarily on the Bank's net interest income, which is the difference between total interest earned on interest-earning assets and total interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and its ability to maintain efficient operations.  In addition to the Bank's net interest income, it produces income through mortgage servicing operations and noninterest income processes, such as trust and investment services.
Lending Activities.
 
General. The Bank provides a broad range of commercial and retail lending services to corporations, partnerships, individuals and government agencies primarily within the Bank's existing market areas.  The Bank actively markets its services to qualified borrowers.  Lending officers build relationships with new borrowers entering the Bank's market areas as well as long-standing members of the local business community.  The Bank has established lending policies that include a number of underwriting factors to be considered in making a loan, including location, loan-to-value ratio, cash flow and the credit history of the borrower.  As of December 31, 2016, the Bank's maximum legal lending limit to one borrower was $22.0 million; however, the Bank may impose additional limitations on the amount it is willing to lend to one borrower as part of its credit risk management policies.  The Bank's loan portfolio is comprised primarily of loans in the areas of commercial real estate, residential real estate, construction, general commercial and consumer lending.  In addition, Trinity has one construction loan.  As of December 31, 2016, commercial real estate loans comprised approximately 51.6% of the total loan portfolio; residential real estate mortgages made up approximately 27.1%; construction real estate loans comprised 9.7%; general commercial loans comprised 9.0%; and consumer lending comprised 2.6%.
Commercial Real Estate Loans. The Bank's commercial real estate lending concentrates on loans to building contractors and developers, as well as owner occupied properties. The Bank collateralizes these loans and, in most cases, obtains personal guarantees to help ensure repayment.  The Bank's commercial real estate loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying real estate collateral.  Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the real estate and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any exists. The primary repayment risk for a commercial real estate loan is the potential loss of revenue of the business which could impact the cash flows, and fair value of the property.
Residential Real Estate Loans. The majority of the residential real estate loans originated and retained by the Bank are in the form of 15- and 30-year variable rate loans.  The Bank also originates 15- to 30-year fixed rate residential mortgages and sells most of these loans to outside investors.  In 2016, the Bank made a strategic change to an outsourced solution whereby the Bank generates residential mortgage applications for non-affiliated residential mortgage companies on a fee basis.  In 2016, the Bank originated approximately $55.8 million in residential real estate loans sold to third parties. As of December 31, 2016, the total sold residential mortgage loan portfolio serviced by the Bank on behalf of third parties was $780.3 million.  The Bank does not engage in financing sub-prime loans nor does it participate in any sub-prime lending programs.  The Bank participates in the current U.S. Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury") programs, including the Home Affordable Modification Program, to work with borrowers who are in danger of, or who have defaulted on residential mortgage loans.
Construction Loans. The Bank is active in financing the construction of residential and commercial properties in New Mexico, primarily in Northern New Mexico.  Management continues to de-emphasize this type of lending in favor of other types of loans.  The Bank manages the risks of construction lending through the use of underwriting and construction loan guidelines and requires work be conducted by reputable contractors.  Construction loans are structured either to convert to permanent loans at the end of the construction phase or to be paid off upon receiving financing from another financial institution.  The amount financed on construction loans is based on the appraised value of the property, as determined by an independent appraiser, and an analysis of the potential marketability and profitability of the project and the costs of construction.  Approximately 20% of all construction loans have terms that do not exceed 24 months.  Loan proceeds are typically disbursed on a percentage of completion basis, as determined by inspections, with all construction required to be completed prior to the final disbursement of funds.
 
Construction loans afford the Bank an opportunity to receive yields higher than those obtainable on adjustable rate mortgage loans secured by existing residential properties.  However, these higher yields correspond to the higher risks associated with construction lending.
 
Commercial Loans. The Bank is an active commercial lender.  The Bank's focus in commercial lending concentrates on loans to business services companies and retailers.  The Bank provides various credit products to commercial customers, including lines of credit for working capital and operational purposes and term loans for the acquisition of equipment and other purposes.  Collateral on commercial loans typically includes accounts receivable, furniture, fixtures, inventory and equipment.  In addition, most commercial loans have personal guarantees to ensure repayment.  The terms of approximately 60% of commercial loans range from one to eight years.  A significant portion of the Bank's commercial business loans reprice within one year or have floating interest rates.
Consumer Loans. The Bank also provides all types of consumer loans, including motor vehicle, home improvement, credit cards, signature loans and small personal credit lines.  Consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields compared to the Bank's other loans, but generally carry higher risks of default.  Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances.
 
Additional information on the risks associated with banking activities and products and concentrations can be found under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K.
 
Competition. There is strong competition, both in originating loans and in attracting deposits, in the Bank's market areas.  Competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from large regional banks, other commercial banks, credit unions, savings institutions and mortgage bankers making loans secured by real estate located in the Bank's market areas. Commercial banks, credit unions and finance companies, including finance company affiliates of automobile manufacturers, provide vigorous competition in consumer lending.  The Bank competes for real estate and other loans principally on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees charged, the types of loans originated and the quality and speed of services provided to borrowers. Insurance companies and internet-based financial institutions present growing areas of competition both for loans and deposits.
 
There is substantial competition in attracting deposits from other commercial banks, savings institutions, money market and mutual funds, credit unions and other investment vehicles.  The Bank's ability to attract and retain deposits depends on its ability to provide investment opportunities that satisfy the requirements of investors as to rate of return, liquidity, risk and other factors.  The financial services industry has become more competitive as technological advances enable companies to provide financial services to customers outside their traditional geographic markets and provide alternative methods for financial transactions.  These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.
 
Employees. As of December 31, 2016, we had 277 full time-equivalent employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
 
Recent Developments
 
Private Placement to Certain Institutional and Accredited Investors
 
On December 19, 2016, the Company closed its previously announced $52 million private placement with Castle Creek Capital Partners VI, L.P. ("Castle Creek"), Patriot Financial Partners II, L.P., Patriot Financial Partners Parallel II, L.P. (collectively, "Patriot") and Strategic Value Bank Partners, L.P., through its fund Strategic Value Investors LP, pursuant to which the Company issued 2,661,239 shares of its common stock, no par value per share, at $4.75 per share, and 82,862 shares of a new series of convertible perpetual non-voting preferred stock, Series C, no par value per share, at $475.00 per share ("Series C Preferred Stock"). The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the private placement to repurchase its outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (as defined below) and Series B Preferred Stock (as defined below), which it completed on January 25, 2017, and use the remaining net proceeds to pay the deferred interest on its trust preferred securities, and for general corporate purposes. 
 
In connection with the private placement and in accordance with the terms of a stock purchase agreement, dated September 9, 2016 (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with each of Castle Creek and Patriot. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to file a resale registration statement for the purpose of registering the resale of the shares of the Common Stock and Series C Preferred Stock issued in the private placement and the underlying shares of Common Stock or non-voting Common Stock into which the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are convertible, as appropriate. The Company is obligated to file the registration statement no later than the third anniversary after the closing of the private placement.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Castle Creek and Patriot entered into side letter agreements with us.  Under the terms of the side letter agreements, each of Castle Creek and Patriot is entitled to have one representative appointed to our Board of Directors for so long as such investor, together with its respective affiliates, owns, in the aggregate, 5% or more of all of our outstanding shares of common stock (including shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock or non-voting common stock).
 
Redemption of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock
 
On March 27, 2009, Trinity participated in the TARP Capital Purchase Program by issuing 35,539 shares of Trinity's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the "Series A Preferred Stock") to the Treasury for a purchase price of $35.5 million in cash and issued warrants that were immediately exercised by the Treasury for 1,777 shares of Trinity's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the "Series B Preferred Stock").  Using part of the proceeds from the private placement described above, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock effective January 25, 2017.
Payment of Deferred Interest on Trust Preferred Securities
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding $37.1 million of trust preferred securities with a total of $9.8 million of accrued and unpaid interest.  During the first quarter of 2017, the Company used part of the proceeds from the private placement, plus a portion of a $15 million dividend from the Bank, to pay all of the accrued and unpaid interest on the junior subordinated debentures.
Conversion of Series C Preferred Stock to Non-Voting Common Stock
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding 82,862 shares of Series C Preferred Stock that were issued in connection with the private placement.  Following shareholder approval of an amendment to the Company's articles of incorporation to authorize a class of non-voting common stock, and the subsequent filing of such amendment with the New Mexico Secretary of State, all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock were automatically converted into 8,286,200 shares of non-voting common stock.
Supervision and Regulation
 
General. Financial institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law.  As a result, the growth and earnings performance of Trinity may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "FRB"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB").  Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") and securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities have an impact on the business of Trinity. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to the operations and results of Trinity and the Bank. The nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty.
 
This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other factors, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies.
 
The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to Trinity and the Bank.  It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described.  The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.
 
Financial Regulatory Reform. On July 21, 2010, former President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") into law.  The Dodd-Frank Act represents a sweeping reform of the U.S. supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions and capital markets in the wake of the global financial crisis, certain aspects of which are described below in more detail. In particular, and among other factors, the Dodd-Frank Act: created a Financial Stability Oversight Council as part of a regulatory structure for identifying emerging systemic risks and improving interagency cooperation; created the CFPB, which is authorized to regulate providers of consumer credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services; narrowed the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws enjoyed by national banks and federal savings associations and expanded the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation; imposed more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies and subjected certain activities, including interstate mergers and acquisitions, to heightened capital conditions; with respect to mortgage lending, (i) significantly expanded  requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property, (ii) imposed strict rules on mortgage servicing, and (iii) required the originator of a securitized loan, or the sponsor of a securitization, to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of securitized exposures unless the underlying exposures are qualified residential mortgages or meet certain underwriting standards; repealed the prohibition on the payment of interest on business checking accounts; restricted the interchange fees payable on debit card transactions for issuers with $10 billion in assets or greater; in the so-called "Volcker Rule," subject to numerous exceptions, prohibited depository institutions and affiliates from certain investments in, and sponsorship of, hedge funds and private equity funds and from engaging in proprietary trading; provided for enhanced regulation of advisers to private funds and of the derivatives markets; enhanced oversight of credit rating agencies; and prohibited banking agency requirements tied to credit ratings. These statutory changes shifted the regulatory framework for financial institutions, impacted the way in which they do business and have the potential to constrain revenues.
 
Numerous provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are required to be implemented through rulemaking by the appropriate federal regulatory agencies.  Although the majority of the Dodd-Frank Act's rulemaking requirements have been met with finalized rules, approximately one-fourth of the rulemaking requirements are either still in the proposal stage or have not yet been proposed.  In addition, on February 3, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order calling for the administration to review various U.S. financial laws and regulations.  The full scope of President Trump's short-term legislative agenda is not yet fully known, but it may include certain deregulatory measures for the banking industry, including the structure and powers of the CFPB and other areas under the Dodd-Frank Act.  Accordingly, it is difficult to anticipate the continued impact this expansive legislation will have on Trinity, the Bank, its customers and the financial industry generally.  Management of Trinity and the Bank will continue to evaluate the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act changes; however no current assurance may be given that the Dodd-Frank Act, or any other new legislative changes, will not have a negative impact on the results of operations and financial condition of Trinity and the Bank.
 
Trinity and Bank Required Capital Levels. Due to the risks to their business, depository institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects earnings capabilities. While capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role has become fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress.  Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, discussed below, establish strengthened capital standards for banks and bank holding companies, require more capital to be held in the form of common stock and disallow certain funds from being included in capital determinations. Once fully implemented, these standards will represent regulatory capital requirements that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place historically.
 
The OCC and FRB guidelines also provide that banks and bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the guidelines indicate that the agencies will continue to consider a "tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio" (deducting all intangibles) in evaluating proposals for expansion or to engage in new activities.
 
Higher capital levels may also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the FRB's capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other factors, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (i.e., Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Bank exceeded its minimum regulatory capital requirements under OCC capital adequacy guidelines.  However, as discussed under " The Bank – Enforcement Action," the Bank has agreed with the OCC to maintain certain heightened regulatory capital ratios.  As of December 31, 2016, the Bank exceeded the heightened regulatory capital ratios to which it had agreed.  As of December 31, 2016, Trinity had regulatory capital in excess of the FRB, Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III requirements.
 
Basel III. In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the "Basel III Rule").  The Basel III Rule became effective on January 1, 2015 and is applicable to all U.S. banks that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies other than "small bank holding companies" (generally bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1 billion).
 
The Basel III Rule not only increases most of the required minimum capital ratios, but it introduces the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ("CET1"), which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), retained earnings, and CET1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments.  The Basel III Rule also expanded the definition of capital as in effect prior to January 1, 2015 by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (Tier 1 Capital in addition to Common Equity) and Tier 2 Capital.  A number of instruments that qualified as Tier 1 Capital prior to the Basel III Rule implementation no longer qualify as such, or their qualifications have changed. For example, cumulative preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, including trust preferred securities, no longer qualify as Tier 1 Capital of any kind, with the exception, subject to certain restrictions, of such instruments issued before May 10, 2010, by bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009. For those institutions, trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying capital instruments currently included in consolidated Tier 1 Capital are permanently grandfathered under the Basel III Rule, subject to certain restrictions.   Noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, which now qualifies as simple Tier 1 Capital, will not qualify as CET1, but will qualify as Additional Tier 1 Capital. The Basel III Rule also constrains the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and requires deductions from CET1 in the event such assets exceed a certain percentage of a bank's CET1.
 
The Basel III Rule requires:
 
 
● | A new required ratio of minimum CET1 equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An increase in the minimum required amount of Tier 1 Capital from 4% of total assets to 6% of risk-weighted assets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A continuation of the minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-weighted assets; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total assets equal to 4% in all circumstances.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Basel III Rule also implements a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banks maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress.  The capital conservation buffer began to be phased in in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019.  An institution would be subject to limitations on certain activities, including discretionary bonuses to executive officers, if its capital level is below the buffered ratio. Factoring in the fully phased-in conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios described above to 7.0% for CET1, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital.
 
The Basel III Rule maintains the general structure of the current prompt corrective action framework, but increases the capital level requirements. The prompt corrective action guidelines were also revised to add the CET1 Capital ratio.  In order to be a "well-capitalized" depository institution under the new regime, a bank must maintain a CET1 Capital ratio of 6.5% or more; a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 8.0% or more; a Total Capital ratio of 10.0% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or more.  However, these "well capitalized" capital requirements are less than the fully buffered risk-based capital ratios described above.  Accordingly, it is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized yet still be out of compliance with the fully phased in buffered ratios discussed above.
 
The Basel III Rule also revises a number of the risk weightings (or their methodologies) for bank assets that are used to determine the capital ratios.
 
Furthermore, Basel III requires unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities to flow through to regulatory capital as opposed to the current treatment, which neutralizes such effects.  The Basel III Rule provided for a one-time election for smaller institutions like Trinity and the Bank to opt out of including most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") in regulatory capital.  This opt-out, which was required to be made in the first quarter of 2015, excluded from regulatory capital both unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities and accumulated net gains and losses on cash-flow hedges and amounts attributable to defined benefit post-retirement plans. Trinity made the opt-out election in the first quarter of 2015.
 
Prompt Corrective Action.  A banking organization's capital plays an important role in connection with regulatory enforcement as well.  Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions.  The extent of the regulators' powers depends on whether the institution in question is "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" or "critically undercapitalized," in each case as defined by regulation.  Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators' corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution's asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to be acquired; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution.  Bank regulatory agencies are uniformly encouraging banks and bank holding companies to be "well-capitalized" and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is "well-capitalized" may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept brokered deposits.
Trinity
 
General.  Trinity, as the sole stockholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company.  As a bank holding company, Trinity is registered with, and is subject to regulation and examination by, the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act ("BHCA").  Trinity is required to file with the FRB periodic reports of Trinity's operations and such additional information regarding Trinity and its subsidiaries as the FRB may require.
Enforcement Action.  On September 26, 2013, the FRB entered into a Written Agreement with Trinity (the "Written Agreement").  The Written Agreement requires Trinity to serve as a source of strength to the Bank and restricts Trinity's ability to issue dividends and other capital distributions and to repurchase or redeem any Trinity stock without the prior written approval of the FRB.  The Written Agreement further requires that Trinity implement a capital plan, subject to approval by the FRB, and submit cash flow projections to the FRB.  Finally, the Written Agreement requires Trinity to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to provide quarterly progress reports to the FRB.
 
Because Trinity is deemed to be in "troubled condition" by virtue of the Written Agreement, it also is required to: (i) obtain the prior approval of the FRB for the appointment of new directors and the hiring or promotion of senior executive officers; and (ii) comply with restrictions on severance payments and indemnification payments to institution-affiliated parties.
 
Acquisitions, Change in Control, and Activities.  The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks.  Under the BHCA, Trinity must obtain prior approval of the FRB or, acting under delegated authority, the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank before (1) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any class of voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after the acquisition, Trinity would directly or indirectly own or control 5% or more of the class; (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.
 
Under the BHCA, any company must obtain approval of the FRB or, acting under delegated authority, the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank, prior to acquiring control of Trinity or the Bank.  For purposes of the BHCA, "control" is defined as ownership of 25% or more of any class of voting securities of Trinity or the Bank, the ability to control the election of a majority of the directors, or exercise of a controlling influence over management or policies of Trinity or the Bank.
 
The Change in Bank Control Act, as amended (the "CIBC"), and the related regulations of the FRB require any person or groups of persons acting in concert (except for companies required to make application under the BHCA), to file a written notice with the FRB or, acting under delegated authority, the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank, before the person or group acquires control of Trinity. The CIBC defines "control" as the direct or indirect power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities or to direct the management or policies of a bank holding company or an insured bank. A rebuttable presumption of control arises under the CIBC where a person or group controls 10% or more, but less than 25%, of a class of the voting stock of a company or insured bank which is a reporting company under the Exchange Act, such as Trinity, or such ownership interest is greater than the ownership interest held by any other person or group.
 
In addition, the CIBC prohibits any entity from acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of a bank holding company's or bank's voting securities, or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over a bank holding company or bank without the approval of the FRB. On September 22, 2008, the FRB issued a policy statement on equity investments in bank holding companies and banks, which allows the FRB to generally be able to conclude that an entity's investment is not "controlling" if the investment in the form of voting and nonvoting shares represents in the aggregate (i) less than one-third of the total equity of the banking organization (and less than one-third of any class of voting securities, assuming conversion of all convertible nonvoting securities held by the entity) and (ii) less than 15% of any class of voting securities of the banking organization.
 
The BHCA generally prohibits Trinity from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries.  This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the FRB prior to November 11, 1999 to be "so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto."  This authority would permit Trinity to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage. The BHCA generally does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.
 
Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the FRB determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally.  Trinity does not currently operate as a financial holding company.
 
Dividend Payments.  In addition to applicable restrictions in the Written Agreement, Trinity's ability to pay dividends to its stockholders also may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and policies of the FRB applicable to bank holding companies. New Mexico law prohibits Trinity from paying dividends if, after giving effect to the dividend: (i) Trinity would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of its business; or (ii) Trinity's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities and (unless Trinity's articles of incorporation otherwise permit) the maximum amount that then would be payable, in any liquidation, in respect of all outstanding shares having preferential rights in liquidation.
 
As a general matter, the FRB has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to stockholders if:  (i) the company's net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company's capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. 
 
Source of Strength.  Under the FRB's "source-of-strength" doctrine, a bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to any of its subsidiary banks. The holding company is expected to commit resources to support a subsidiary bank, including at times when the holding company may not be in a financial position to provide such support. A bank holding company's failure to meet its source-of-strength obligations may constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or a violation of the FRB's regulations, or both. The source-of-strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies in situations where the bank holding company's subsidiary bank fails to maintain adequate capital levels. This doctrine was codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, but the FRB has not yet adopted regulations to implement this requirement.
Federal Securities Regulation.  Trinity's common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act. Consequently, Trinity is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.
Incentive Compensation
 
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization's ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors.
 
The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not "large, complex banking organizations."  The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
 
In addition, Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act required certain regulators (including the FDIC, SEC and Federal Reserve) to adopt requirements or guidelines prohibiting excessive compensation. In May 2016, the federal banking regulators, joined by the SEC, proposed such a rule that is tailored based on the asset size of the institution.  All covered financial institutions would be subject to a prohibition on paying compensation, fees, and benefits that are "unreasonable" or "disproportionate" to the value of the services performed by a person covered by the proposed rule (generally, senior executive officers and employees who are significant risk-takers).  Moreover, the proposed rule includes a new requirement which provides that an incentive-based compensation arrangement must (i) include financial and non-financial measures of performance, (ii) be designed to allow non-financial measures of performance to override financial measures of performance, when appropriate (so called safety and soundness factors), and (iii) be subject to adjustment to reflect actual losses, inappropriate risk taking, compliance deficiencies, or other measures or aspects of financial and non-financial performance.
 

The Bank
 
General.  The Bank is a national bank, chartered by the OCC under the National Bank Act.  The deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (the "DIF") to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations, and the Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System.  As a national bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the OCC. The FDIC, as administrator of the DIF, also has regulatory authority over the Bank.  The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions.
Enforcement Actions.  On November 30, 2012, the Bank entered into a Formal Agreement with the OCC (the "Formal Agreement"). On December 17, 2013, the Bank entered into a Consent Order with the OCC (the "Consent Order").  The focus of the Consent Order, which terminated the Bank's Formal Agreement, is on improving the Bank's credit administration, credit underwriting, internal controls, compliance and management supervision.  Additionally, the Consent Order requires that the Bank maintain certain capital ratios and receive approval of the OCC prior to declaring dividends.  The Consent Order requires the Bank to maintain the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 8%; and (ii) a Total risk-based capital ratio of at least 11%.  Being subject to the Consent Order means that the Bank may not be deemed to be "well capitalized" under the prompt corrective action rules.
 
Because the Bank is deemed to be in "troubled condition" by virtue of the Consent Order, it also is required to: (i) obtain the prior approval of the OCC for the appointment of new directors and the hiring or promotion of senior executive officers; and (ii) comply with restrictions on severance payments and indemnification payments to institution-affiliated parties.
 
Deposit Insurance.  The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for bank, savings institutions, and credit unions to $250,000 per insured depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009.  As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.  The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured depository institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification.  An institution's risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators.
 
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act an institution's assessment base is calculated based on its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. This may shift the burden of deposit insurance premiums toward those large depository institutions that rely on funding sources other than U.S. deposits.  Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act makes changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, requires large institutions to bear the burden of raising the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.  The FDIC has until September 3, 2020 to meet the 1.35% reserve ratio target. The reserve ratio reached 1.15% effective June 30, 2016.  Lower rates, surcharges, and new pricing became effective July 1, 2016 and those appeared on the December 30, 2016 invoice.
 
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ("FICO"), an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. These assessments, which are included in Deposit Insurance Premiums on the Consolidated Statements of Income, will continue until the FICO bonds mature between 2017 and 2019.
 
Supervisory Assessments.  National banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the OCC to fund the operations of the OCC.  The amount of the assessment is calculated using a formula that takes into account the bank's size and its supervisory condition.  During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Bank paid supervisory assessments to the OCC totaling $720 thousand and $648 thousand, respectively.
 
Dividend Payments.  The primary source of funds for Trinity is dividends from the Bank.  Under the National Bank Act, a national bank may pay dividends out of its undivided profits in such amounts and at such times as the bank's board of directors deems prudent.  Without prior OCC approval, however, a national bank may not pay dividends in any calendar year that, in the aggregate, exceed the bank's year-to-date net income plus the bank's retained net income for the two preceding years.
 
The payment of dividends by any financial institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and a financial institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized.
 
The Bank may not pay any dividend unless it complies with certain provisions of the Consent Order and receives a prior written determination of no supervisory objection from the OCC.
 
Insider Transactions.  The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on "covered transactions" between the Bank and its "affiliates." Trinity is an affiliate of the Bank for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to Trinity, investments in the stock or other securities of Trinity and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of Trinity as collateral for loans made by the Bank.  The Dodd-Frank Act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates as of July 21, 2011, including an expansion of the definition of "covered transactions" and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
 
Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of Trinity and its subsidiaries, to principal stockholders of Trinity and to "related interests" of such directors, officers and principal stockholders.  In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who is a director or officer of Trinity or the Bank, or a principal stockholder of Trinity, may obtain credit from banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship.
 
Safety and Soundness Standards/ Risk Management.  The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions.  The guidelines set forth standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.
 
In general, the safety and soundness guidelines prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals.  If an institution fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in the guidelines, the institution's primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator's order is cured, the regulator may restrict the institution's rate of growth, require the institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Noncompliance with the standards established by the safety and soundness guidelines may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal banking regulators, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments.
 
During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the institutions they supervise.  Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets.  The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, and reputational risk. In particular, recent regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk, which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. The Bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures, and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring, and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls.
 
Branching Authority.  National banks headquartered in New Mexico, such as the Bank, have the same branching rights in New Mexico as banks chartered under New Mexico law, subject to OCC approval.  New Mexico law grants New Mexico-chartered banks the authority to establish branches anywhere in the State of New Mexico, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals.
 
Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger.  The establishment of new interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) has historically been permitted only in those states in which the laws expressly authorize such expansion. However, the Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new branches across state lines without these impediments.
 
Transaction Account Reserves. FRB regulations require depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily negotiable order of withdrawal and regular checking accounts).  For 2016, the first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempt from the reserve requirements; for transaction accounts aggregating more than $15.2 million to $110.2 million, the reserve requirement is 3% of total transaction accounts; and for net transaction accounts in excess of $110.2 million, the reserve requirement is $2.85 million plus 10% of the aggregate amount of total transaction accounts in excess of $110.2 million.  These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the FRB.  The Bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements.
Federal Home Loan Bank System.  The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (the "FHLB"), which serves as a central credit facility for its members. The FHLB is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to member banks in the form of FHLB advances. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully collateralized as determined by the FHLB.
Community Reinvestment Act Requirements.  The Community Reinvestment Act requires the Bank to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  Federal regulators regularly assess the Bank's record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for additional acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of the Bank's effectiveness in meeting its Community Reinvestment Act obligations.
 
Anti-Money Laundering and Know-Your-Customer.  The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the "Patriot Act") is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act mandates financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address any or all of the following matters: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between financial institutions and law enforcement authorities.  In addition, on May 10, 2016, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a final rule regarding customer due diligence requirements for covered financial institutions in connection with their Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering policies.  The final rule has a requirement to understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships and identify the "beneficial owner" of legal entity customers.  The formal implementation date is May 11, 2018.
 
Bank Secrecy Act.  Trinity and the Bank are also subject to the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives the federal government powers to address money laundering and terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, and mandatory transaction reporting obligations. The Bank Secrecy Act imposes an affirmative obligation on the Bank to report currency transactions that exceed certain thresholds and to report other transactions determined to be suspicious. The Bank Secrecy Act requires that all banking institutions develop and provide for the continued administration of a program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements regarding both domestic and international currency transactions. These programs must, at a minimum, provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance, provide for independent testing of such systems and compliance, designate individuals responsible for such compliance and provide appropriate personnel training.
UDAP and UDAAP.  Banking regulatory agencies use a general consumer protection statute to address "unethical" or otherwise "bad" business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law.  The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, referred to as the FTC Act, which is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, referred to as UDAP, and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. "Unjustified consumer injury" is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with UDAP laws and regulations. However, UDAP laws and regulations have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to "unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices," referred to as UDAAP, which have been delegated to the CFPB for rule-making. The federal banking agencies have the authority to enforce such rules and regulations.
Commercial Real Estate Guidance.  The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance ("CRE Guidance") provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks' levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. Based on the Bank's current loan portfolio, the Bank does not exceed these guidelines. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a "Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending" reminding banks of the need to engage in risk management practices for commercial real estate lending.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Act to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking, supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and thrifts, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth-in Lending Act ("TILA"), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ("RESPA"), Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. Banking institutions with total assets of $10 billion or less, such as the Bank, remain subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws and such additional regulations as may be adopted by the CFPB.
 
Effective January 10, 2013, the CFPB released its final "Ability-to-Repay/Qualified Mortgage" rules, which amended TILA's implementing regulation, Regulation Z. The final rule implements sections 1411 and 1412 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally require creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer's ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open-end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage, or temporary loan) and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for "qualified mortgages." The final rule also implements section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which limits prepayment penalties. Finally, the final rule requires creditors to retain evidence of compliance with the rule for three years after a covered loan is consummated. This rule became effective January 10, 2014. The CFPB allowed for a small creditor exemption for banks with assets under $2 billion and that originate less than 500 mortgage loans in 2015. As of January 1, 2016, the small creditor exemption was extended to banks with assets under $2 billion and that originate less than 2,000 mortgage loans.
 
On November 20, 2013, pursuant to section 1032(f) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued the Know Before You Owe TILA/RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule ("TRID"), which combined the disclosures required under TILA and sections 4 and 5 of RESPA, into a single, integrated disclosure for mortgage loan transactions covered by those laws. TRID, which requires the use of a Loan Estimate that must be delivered or placed in the mail no later than the third business day after receiving the consumer's application and a Closing Disclosure that must be provided to the consumer at least three business days prior to consummation, became effective for applications received on or after October 3, 2015 for applicable closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. Creditors must only use the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure forms for mortgage loan transactions subject to TRID. All other mortgage loan transactions continue to use the Good Faith Estimate and the Initial Truth-in-Lending Disclosure at application and the HUD-1 Settlement Statement and the Final Truth-in-Lending Disclosure at closing. TRID also has new tolerance requirements and record retention requirements. Of note, the creditor must retain evidence of compliance with the Loan Estimate requirements, including providing the Loan Estimate, and the Closing Disclosure requirements for three years after the later of the date of consummation, the date disclosures are required to be made or the date the action is required to be taken. Additionally, the creditor must retain copies of the Closing Disclosure, including all documents related to the Closing Disclosure, for five years after consummation.
 
Although it is difficult to predict at this time the extent to which the CFPB's final rules impact the operations and financial condition of the Bank, such rules may have a material impact on the Bank's compliance costs, compliance risk and fee income.
 
Foreclosure and Loan Modifications. Federal and state laws further impact foreclosures and loan modifications, with many of such laws having the effect of delaying or impeding the foreclosure process on real estate secured loans in default. Mortgages on commercial property can be modified, such as by reducing the principal amount of the loan or the interest rate, or by extending the term of the loan, through plans confirmed under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In recent years, legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress that would amend the Bankruptcy Code to permit courts to modify mortgages secured by residences, although at this time the enactment of such legislation is not presently proposed. The scope, duration and terms of potential future legislation with similar effect continue to be discussed. Trinity cannot predict whether any such legislation will be passed or the impact, if any, it would have on Trinity's business.
Servicing.  Effective January 10, 2014, servicing rules require servicers to meet certain benchmarks for loan servicing and customer service in general.  Servicers must provide periodic billing statements and certain required notices and acknowledgments, promptly credit borrowers' accounts for payments received and promptly investigate complaints by borrowers and are required to take additional steps before purchasing insurance to protect the lender's interest in the property.  The servicing rules also call for additional notice, review and timing requirements with respect to delinquent borrowers, including early intervention, ongoing access to servicer personnel and specific loss mitigation and foreclosure procedures.  The rules provide for an exemption from most of these requirements for "small servicers." A small servicer is defined as a loan servicer that services 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans and services only mortgage loans that they or an affiliate originated or own.
Additional Constraints on Trinity and Bank.
 
Monetary Policy. The monetary policy of the FRB has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the tools available to the FRB to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
