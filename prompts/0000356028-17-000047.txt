Item 1. Business.
Overview
CA Technologies is a global leader in software solutions enabling customers to plan, develop, manage and secure applications and enterprise environments across distributed, cloud, mobile and mainframe platforms. Most of the Global Fortune 500, as well as many government agencies around the world, rely on CA to help manage their increasingly dynamic and complex environments.
In every industry, we see customers transforming their businesses to better manage the market demands for speed, exceptional customer experience and rich analytics. Their journey, which is broadly referred to as digital transformation, is fueled by software. The proliferation of mobile devices and the expectation of seamless connectivity has driven users to demand highly secure, frictionless user experiences via software applications (often referred to as “applications” or “apps”). We refer to this market shift as the “Application Economy” and it is profoundly changing the way businesses provide services to customers and build software. Around the world, these trends are placing software at the heart of every business, driving companies in every industry vertical to invest in the creation of in-house software development teams to build out new business models, enhance their digital presence and support their on-going relationships with customers.
We address this opportunity with three distinct but highly complementary operating segments: Enterprise Solutions, Mainframe Solutions and Services. These also represent the operating segments used by our Chief Executive Officer for evaluating our performance and allocating resources. Refer to Note 17, “Segment and Geographic Information,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial data pertaining to our segment and geographic operations.
Our Enterprise Solutions segment includes products that are designed for distributed and cloud computing environments and run on industry standard servers. Within Enterprise Solutions, our areas of focus include:

• | Agile Management enables customers to plan, deliver and manage information technology (IT) and business services for their customers. Our solutions and Agile services enable customers to improve delivery time on projects, reduce costs and optimize resources. This positions CA to partner with and guide customers early in the business transformation process.


▪ | CA Agile Central. Our solutions help customers with their transition from traditional software delivery methodologies to the Agile methodology (iterative work cadences that decrease time-to-market and increase product quality). It allows businesses to collaboratively plan, prioritize and track software development work at scale, across the enterprise.


▪ | CA Project & Portfolio Management (PPM). Our solutions enable customers to improve their decision processes and resource optimizations of technology and business investments and decrease project execution risk. This foundational piece of our Agile Management strategy is complementary to CA Agile Central.


▪ | CA Service Management. Our solutions empower corporate IT teams to speed up and streamline service desk operations while reducing complex and repetitive tasks of service management processes through comprehensive automation capabilities and simple configuration.


• | DevOps is adjacent to Agile Management and comprises a range of solutions that allow customers to efficiently deliver and manage applications and IT infrastructure. With our portfolio of solutions, customers can reduce the delivery time of new applications, increase the frequency of new releases and dramatically improve quality.


▪ | Application Programming Interface Management (API Management). Application programming interfaces (APIs) are the building blocks of modern application and software development. Our solutions facilitate the creation, security and management of APIs throughout their entire lifecycle, enabling customers to connect more directly with end-users via mobile apps, cloud platforms and ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) devices. We provide solutions for each phase of the API lifecycle: CA Live API Creator automates the creation of APIs from existing data; CA API Gateway allows enterprises to securely orchestrate and expose APIs; CA API Developer Portal enables developers to easily discover and consume APIs; and CA Mobile App Services accelerate mobile and IoT development by providing reusable APIs and services for common use cases. Finally, our API Academy offers thought leadership and API strategy to customers undergoing digital transformation initiatives.

▪ | Continuous Delivery. Our solutions optimize application development processes by automating the deployment of applications across all stages of their lifecycles. Our primary solutions are: CA Service Virtualization, which eliminates constraints in development and testing by modeling and simulating the behavior and performance characteristics of dependent systems and services, enabling defects to be identified quickly and improving time-to-market; CA Release Automation, which automates and orchestrates the complex process of deploying and promoting new application capabilities from planning through development and production; CA Test Data Manager, which automates the creation and management of the test data needed to test evolving applications; and CA BlazeMeter, which enables development teams to improve the quality of Web and mobile applications by testing earlier and more often using open-source functional and performance testing tools throughout the development lifecycle.


▪ | Application Performance Management (APM). Application availability for the end user is dependent on a series of disparate systems performing in concert. Our APM solutions provide deep application diagnostics, end user experience monitoring, synthetic monitoring and analytics to proactively identify and fix issues before users are impacted. Our APM solutions scale and manage billions of transactions, across diverse enterprise applications and platforms, including Amazon Web Services SM (AWS).


▪ | Infrastructure Management. Our solutions offer a unified approach to monitoring and managing network, server and storage performance, whether they are contained within traditional data centers or diverse cloud environments. Our solutions provide operations teams in some of the largest IT organizations in the world with rapid access to the information needed to improve service quality, predictability and efficiency. CA Unified Infrastructure Management (UIM) enables monitoring and management of server, storage and network devices, including those in public cloud environments such as AWS® and Microsoft AZURE®.


• | Security includes a comprehensive set of solutions that address the global imperative to minimize the risk of data breaches and alleviate the pressures faced by Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) as a result of increasing information security regulations. Our solutions facilitate digital transformation by providing secure customer experiences, enabling a collaborative enterprise, empowering a digital workforce and securing the IoT. CA’s Security suite simplifies the complexity of managing the trusted digital relationships among people, devices, and applications both on-premise and in the cloud. 


▪ | Privileged Access Management (PAM). Privileged users, or users who have elevated access or administrator rights, are commonly the targets of data breach attempts. Our solutions enable customers to control and monitor privileged user access and activity, detecting and preventing the threat of internal and external attacks.


▪ | Identity Management. We offer a unified solution with user provisioning, user management and governance for identities throughout their lifecycle, providing timely and compliant access to applications and data.


▪ | Advanced Authentication. We offer risk-based and credential-based authentication enabling customers to comply with regulatory mandates in authenticating employees, partners and consumers with a frictionless user experience.


▪ | Identity Service (IDS). We provide a software as a service (SaaS)-based identity management solution to enable access to applications across a hybrid enterprise, using both SaaS and on-premise applications.


▪ | Single Sign-On (SSO). Our solutions provide secure single sign-on and flexible access management to web applications on-premise or in the cloud.


▪ | Payment Security. We offer a SaaS-based payment card enrollment and authentication service to help banks protect against fraud and ensure a hassle-free online shopping experience for their customers.

Our Mainframe Solutions are designed for the IBM z Systems™ platform, which runs many of our largest customers’ mission-critical business applications. Our Mainframe Solutions help customers improve economics by increasing throughput and lowering cost per transaction, increase business agility through DevOps tooling and processes, increase reliability and availability of operations through machine intelligence and automation solutions, and protect enterprise data with security and compliance. Due largely to mobile application usage and the IoT, greater than 75% of mainframe users are experiencing MIPS (millions of instructions per second), or usage, growth. We are viewed as a long-term strategic partner to our largest customers to help them manage this usage growth, while simultaneously helping them with their core business and IT challenges. Within Mainframe Solutions, our areas of focus include:

• | DevOps solutions help customers increase the innovation velocity for mainframe applications and teams. We support agile development processes and modern languages, as well as tools for development, testing and deployment that support collaboration across the software development lifecycle and across mobile to mainframe teams.


• | Operations Intelligence and Automation solutions help customers adopt machine learning and bring more intelligence and automation to their mainframe operations. With machine learning, operations teams can proactively prevent problems, fix issues faster and get more done with fewer resources. We provide a unified view of z Systems performance across the infrastructure stack, including applications, middleware, networks, systems, storage and data.

5


• | Security & Compliance solutions help customers address stringent data security and compliance requirements, such as EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), by finding sensitive data, classifying data for compliance purposes, alerting risks in real-time, and inspecting threats to protect mission-essential data-running 100 percent on the mainframe.

Our Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe Solutions segments are complementary and strengthen each other in several ways (Refer to Figure 1 - Complementary Segments below). First, our customers benefit from the ability of CA solutions to span their entire infrastructure stack, across distributed, cloud and mainframe. This is critical as customers focus on their end users’ experiences on their apps and the underlying transactions that traverse their heterogeneous environments. CA is one of the few companies positioned to deliver solutions that span cloud, open systems and mainframe environments, reducing our customers’ cost of ownership and improving their time-to-service error resolution. For example, our Workload Automation solutions support all platforms - mobile to mainframe - enabling customers across a number of industry verticals to deliver seamless operations and intelligent automation. Second, we are able to leverage our core strengths and development efforts in our products within the Enterprise Solutions segment to bring new innovations to the mainframe. CA Release Automation Connector for z/OS, which supports release automation on all platforms, is a good illustration of this synergistic relationship. Our continued investment in the mainframe sustains ongoing customer commitment to our mainframe solutions. From our Agile and Security expertise to UIM and APM solutions specifically tailored for the mainframe, our customers benefit from our synergistic portfolio. Third, the Enterprise Solutions segment benefits from CA’s heritage in running mission critical applications for many of the world’s largest companies. This gives us access to decision makers and consideration for new sales opportunities that would otherwise be more difficult to obtain. Finally, CA benefits from the operational and financial synergies that result from our expertise in both segments.
Our Services help customers reach their IT and business goals primarily by enabling the rapid implementation and adoption of our mainframe and enterprise solutions. Our professional services team consists of experienced professionals who provide a variety of services, such as consulting, implementation, application management services, education and support services, to both commercial and government customers. With approximately 1,000 certified consultants, architects, project managers and advisors located in 30 countries and an extensive partner ecosystem, CA Services works with customers to navigate complex business and technology challenges and deliver the services that best meet the customer’s business goals throughout the entire solution lifecycle.

Business Strategy
Our goal is to be the world’s leading independent software provider for IT management and security solutions that help organizations and enterprises plan, develop, manage, and secure modern software environments, across mainframe, distributed, cloud and mobile platforms. To accomplish this, key elements of our strategy include:

• | Drive organic innovation. Our product development strategy is built around key growth areas, where we are focused on innovating and delivering differentiated products and solutions across both distributed and mainframe platforms. We are focused on developing solutions that are easy to use, easy to implement and have a low total cost of ownership. A key element of our organic innovation approach is the broad adoption of the Agile methodology to govern our software development process, which we believe improves our product development time-to-market, quality and relevance, and supports our customer success initiatives.

• | Incubate technology for next generation products. We are researching and dedicating resources to the development of emerging technologies that are logical extensions of our core areas of focus. We are working on opportunities in areas such as containers, data analytics, big data and open source, some of which may enhance or extend our current product portfolio and others of which may evolve into new product categories.


• | Pursue new business models and expanded routes to market. While our traditional on-premise software delivery remains relevant to many enterprise customers, we see cloud-based and try-and-buy models as attractive to both our existing and potential customers. These models simplify decision-making and accelerate the value customers can derive from new solution investments. New delivery models allow us to extend our market reach, speed adoption of our solutions, improve our efficiencies and compete more effectively for a larger number of customers globally. As such, our new product development is focused on our customers’ need for solutions that are simple and cost-effective to buy, install, deploy, manage and secure.


• | Expand relationships with our global customer base and address opportunities with new and underserved customers. We are focused on maintaining and expanding the strong relationships with our established customer base, and will proactively target growth with other potential customers that we do not currently serve. In parallel, we seek to broaden our customer base to new buyers in geographic regions we have underserved. The emerging roles of CISOs and Chief Development Officers impacts who and where IT environment purchasing decisions are made within our customers. This shift aligns with the product portfolio decisions we are making across our solutions set to meet our customers’ accelerating need for speed and agility. We are refining our sales, services, marketing and customer success resources to reach beyond the customers’ Chief Information Officer and IT department to serve these new customer roles and respond to changes in customer buying behaviors.


• | Execute strategic and disciplined technology acquisitions. We intend to supplement our organic innovation efforts with key technology acquisitions that are within or adjacent to our core areas of focus. We conduct a thorough acquisition process, which includes build vs. buy analysis and opportunity identification, detailed business case modeling, rigorous due diligence and extensive integration, to fully realize the value of our acquisitions. We also focus on organically developing nascent technologies from companies we have acquired to endow them with the necessary interoperability, resilience and security to operate at scale in the large, heterogeneous IT environments utilized by our customers.

Fiscal 2017 Business Developments and Highlights
The following are significant developments and highlights relating to our business during fiscal 2017:

• | In October 2016, we completed our acquisition of BlazeMeter, a privately-held provider of open source-based continuous application performance testing.


• | In November 2016, Kieran McGrath was appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.


• | In November 2016, we held our user conference, CA World ‘16. This event showcased our unique strength in serving customers in the Application Economy. The event highlighted our solutions as well as our vision of the future to thousands of customers and partners.


• | In January 2017, we completed our acquisition of Automic Holding GmbH, a privately-held provider of business process and IT automation software.

• | In March 2017, we completed our acquisition of Veracode, Inc., a privately-held provider of cloud-based security testing solutions for web, mobile and third-party applications across the software development lifecycle.

Seasonality
Some of our business results are seasonally weighted toward the second half of our fiscal year, including cash flow from operations and total bookings. However, these business results may not always follow this pattern during a fiscal year. Given the varying durations and dollar amounts of the contracts being renewed, year-over-year comparisons of total bookings are not always indicative of the overall total bookings trend.
Customers
We currently serve customers across most major industries worldwide, including banks, insurance companies, other financial services providers, government agencies, global IT service providers, telecommunication providers, manufacturers, technology companies, retailers, educational organizations and health care institutions. Our traditional customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex. As the emergence of cloud computing has democratized the technology landscape, we have increased our focus on addressing a broader customer set.
7

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015. Approximately 6% and 7% of our total revenue backlog at March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, is associated with multi-year contracts signed with the U.S. federal government and other U.S. state and local government agencies, which are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and/or renegotiation or termination at the discretion of the government.
Sales and Marketing
We offer our solutions through our direct sales force and indirectly through our partners. We remain focused on strengthening relationships with our core customers and partners - approximately our top 500 accounts, which we refer to as our “Platinum” accounts - through product leadership, account management and a differentiated customer experience. We believe enhanced relationships in our traditional customer base of large enterprises with multi-year enterprise license agreements will drive renewals and provide opportunities to increase account penetration that will help to drive revenue growth.
We are working to accelerate the velocity of our sales transactions by dedicating sales resources and deploying additional solutions to address opportunities to sell to new enterprises and to expand our relationship with existing non-Platinum customers - which we refer to as our “Named” and “Growth/Partners” (or Partner-led) customers. Named customers are large potential customers with whom we currently do not have a strong presence and where a competitor often has an established relationship. Growth/Partners customers are mid-size potential customers with whom we currently do not have a strong presence and generally address through partners. Additionally, we have implemented broad-based business initiatives to drive continued improvement in sales execution. We are continuing to shift to a more product-driven sales approach, using real-time data and intelligence to drive on-going evolution of our go-to-market strategy towards the highest potential and highest-yielding markets.
In fiscal 2018, we will streamline and migrate the nomenclature of Platinum, Named and Growth to two groups, Enterprise and Commercial. Our Enterprise sales group will encompass our Platinum customers as well as our largest Named customers. Our Commercial sales group will be entirely served by our digital sales team and partners. We believe this will enable us to better serve a broader set of potential customers globally and can support a lower cost, higher velocity go-to-market strategy for CA over time.
Our sales organization operates globally, with groups serving the North America (NA); Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Latin America (LA); and Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) geographies. We operate through branches, subsidiaries and partners around the world. Approximately 36% and 36% of our revenue in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, was from operations outside of the United States. At March 31, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately 3,000 and 2,500, respectively, of sales and sales support personnel.
Marketing has played a key role in the ongoing transformation of our company, having helped to both reshape perceptions of CA and build capability that enables us to better serve our customer’s digital transformation. The critical role we play in enabling companies to compete and service customers in a software-defined era is now better understood and driving interest in our offerings. Based on research conducted across global markets, CA Technologies’ brand positioning, “Business, rewritten by software,™” has resonated and the campaigns are positively influencing key reputation metrics and future consideration of our in purchase decisions. In particular, we see shifting historical market perceptions of us towards attributes and attitudes that better reflect our current portfolio of capability. Operationally, to accelerate the role marketing plays in creating demand, we have sharpened our talent, tools and processes to better reach new customers to drive a higher velocity of opportunity creation for sales. Our marketing and sales organizations now utilize common systems and analytics to initiate and respond to market opportunities, optimize resources, maximize efficiency and drive awareness and consideration of our brand and portfolio capabilities across our broad base of customers and prospects.
Partners
Our partners represent a foundational component of our go-to-market strategy. Our objective is to leverage our solutions and our partners’ strengths to deliver exceptional customer experiences, create greater value for our customers, and drive profitable and sustainable growth for both us and our partners. At the core of our global partner strategy, we aim to align our products, routes to market, customer segments and our focus partners. Our data-driven approach of aligning our global partner strategy with market opportunities, channel trends and dynamic changes in the industry enables us to match our offerings and investments to specific markets.
We work with partners in all our geographic regions and focus on five key routes to market:

• | Resellers derive revenue primarily from the resale of third-party products. We work with a number of key strategic national and regional reseller partners to expand our global reach.


• | Global Service Providers provide a platform for application infrastructure or cloud-based service offerings. We seek to establish long-term partnerships to support the development of innovative, differentiated service offerings.


• | Global System Integrators offer our software within their business practices, leveraging their process design, planning, and vertical expertise to provide holistic solutions and implementation services to our joint customers.

8


• | Managed Service Providers leverage our solutions to power their subscription-based IT services. We work together to deliver differentiated, high-value managed services.


• | Global Technology Partners (including Independent Software Vendors and Infrastructure and Public Cloud Vendors) offer an opportunity for joint solutions, innovative business models, and CA brand awareness.

Customer Success
The Customer Success organization is made up of customer experience designers, customer advocates, technical support engineers, community managers and an advanced customer data analytics team that together have one common goal to deliver a superior end-to-end customer experience that creates and sustains satisfaction and loyalty, and serves as a source of competitive advantage for CA.
The Customer Success teams work with customers to understand their unique business challenges to help maximize the value of their investments in our solutions. The Customer Success team aligns with members from education, support, services, partners and development to drive customer adoption, facilitate product expansion and to provide maximum return in minimal time.
CA Support engineers work with customers post-sale to assist in migration and upgrades, resolve issues 24/7, and create self-help knowledge documentation. CA Support operates in 36 locations worldwide, providing assistance in 16 languages while consistently earning industry-leading customer satisfaction ratings.
Throughout the customer experience, customers are encouraged to join online communities to interact and engage with their peers, partners, and our CA experts. We have more than 50,000 community members in over 40 communities who network, ask and answer questions, and share knowledge about our solutions.
Research and Development
We have approximately 5,100 employees globally who design, develop, and support our software. We operate principal research and development centers across the US, including New York, California, Colorado, Texas, Illinois and Massachusetts. Internationally, we have principal centers in Prague, Czech Republic as well as Hyderabad and Bangalore, India.
In fiscal 2017, research and development focused on developing solutions that are easy for customers to install, use and maintain, and improving the quality and stability in our broadly deployed products which allows us to focus investment towards innovation initiatives.
We are advancing our Agile Management, DevOps and Security solutions while endeavoring to build a common technology stack across several of our product lines. We are making strides towards this shared component approach to make it easier, faster and more efficient for new solutions to be built.
We are also accelerating innovation with our CA Accelerator, which uses an incubator model to apply lean start-up best practices to grow new businesses. We are interested in areas of increasing importance to enterprises, such as big data, analytics, containerization, developer productivity, security and the IoT. This model ensures we are making appropriate investments and building technology that customers value, using a small-batch, cost-efficient approach. We are also utilizing university partnerships to support and advance development.
Our research and development activities include a number of efforts to support our technical community in its pursuit of creating leading solutions for customers. We continue to use two CA initiatives, the Office of the CTO Research and CA University Relations, to strengthen our relationships with research communities by working with academia, professional associations, industry standards bodies, customers and partners to explore novel products and emerging technologies. We also engage with universities to conduct product-focused research to create solutions for emerging opportunities.
We have charged to operations $586 million, $560 million, and $603 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for product development and enhancements.
Our product offerings and go-to-market strategy continue to evolve to include solutions that may be delivered either on-premise or via SaaS or cloud platforms. We expect our product offerings to continue to become available to customers at more frequent intervals than our historical release cycles. Over the last few years, we have continued to leverage Agile development methodologies, which are characterized by a dynamic development process with more frequent revisions to a product release’s features and functions as the software is being developed. In addition, we have implemented a holistic portfolio management process, which has improved transparency and efficiency across the portfolio through a quarterly cadence of business reviews.

Intellectual Property
Our products and technology are generally proprietary. We rely on U.S. and foreign intellectual property laws, including patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, to protect our proprietary rights. However, the extent and duration of protection given to different types of intellectual property rights vary under different countries' legal systems. In some countries, full-scale intellectual property protection for our products and technology may be unavailable, and the laws of other jurisdictions may not protect our proprietary technology rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We also maintain contractual restrictions in our agreements with customers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property rights. These restrictions generally bind our customers and employees to confidentiality regarding our intellectual property and limit our customers’ use of our software and prohibit certain disclosures to third parties.
We regularly license software and technology from third parties, including some competitors, and incorporate them into our own software products. We include third-party technology in our products in accordance with contractual relationships that specify our rights.
We believe that our patent portfolio differentiates our products and services from those of our competitors, enhances our ability to access third-party technology and helps protect our investment in research and development. We continue to enhance our internal patent program to increase our ability to capture patents, strengthen their quality and increase the pace at which we are able to move our innovations through the patent process. At March 31, 2017, our patent portfolio included more than 1,350 issued patents and more than 900 pending applications in the United States and abroad. The patents generally expire at various times over the next 20 years. Although the durations and geographic intellectual property protection coverage for our patents may vary, we believe our patent portfolio adequately protects our interests. Although we have a number of patents and pending applications that may be of value to various aspects of our products and technology, we are not aware of any single patent that is essential to us or to any of our reportable segments.
The source code for our products is protected both as trade secrets and as copyrighted works. Our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products. Rather, on-premise customers typically access only the executable code for our products, and SaaS customers access only the functionality of our SaaS offerings. Under certain contingent circumstances, some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrow arrangement that enables them to obtain a limited right to access our source code.
We continue to be engaged in efforts to more fully employ our intellectual property by strategically licensing and/or assigning selected assets within our portfolio. This effort is intended to better position us in the marketplace and allow us the flexibility to reinvest in improving our overall business.
Product Licensing and Maintenance
For traditional, on-premise licensing, we typically license to customers either perpetually or on a subscription basis for a specified term. Our customers also purchase maintenance and support services that provide technical support and any general product enhancements released during the maintenance period.
Under a perpetual license, the customer has the right to use the licensed program for an indefinite period of time, typically upon payment of a one-time license fee. If the customer wants to receive maintenance, the customer is required to pay an additional annual maintenance fee.
Under a subscription license, the customer has the right to usage and maintenance of the licensed products during the term of the agreement. Under our licensing terms, customers can license our software products under multi-year licenses, with most customers choosing terms of three to five years, although some customers seeking greater cost certainty may negotiate longer terms. Thereafter, the license generally renews for the same period of time on the same terms and conditions, but subject to the customer's payment of our then-applicable fees.
Within these license categories, our contracts provide customers with the right to use our products under a variety of models including, but not limited to:

• | A typical designated central processing unit (CPU) license, under which the customer may use the licensed product on a single, designated CPU.


• | A MIPS-based license, which allows the customer to use the licensed product on one or more CPUs, limited by the aggregate MIPS rating of the CPUs covered by the license.


• | A user-based license, under which the customer may use the licensed product by or for the agreed number of licensed users.


• | A designated server license, under which the customer may use a certain distributed product on a single, designated server. The licensed products must be licensed for use with a specific operating system.

Customers can obtain licenses to our products through individual discrete purchases to meet their immediate needs or through the adoption of enterprise license agreements. Enterprise license agreements are comprehensive licenses that cover multiple products and also provide for maintenance and support.
10

For our mainframe solutions, the majority of our licenses provide customers with the right to use one or more of our products up to a specific license capacity, generally measured in MIPS. For these products, customers may acquire additional capacity during the term of a license by paying us an additional license fee. For our enterprise solutions, our licenses may provide customers with the right to use one or more of our products limited to a number of servers, users or copies, among other things. Customers may license these products for additional servers, users or copies, etc., during the term of a license by paying us an additional license fee.
SaaS is another delivery model we offer for certain products when a customer prefers to use our technology off-premises with little or no infrastructure required. Our SaaS offerings are typically licensed for a designated term using a subscription fee. Our SaaS products, which are becoming a larger part of our Enterprise Solutions portfolio, typically have a shorter average duration and smaller initial contract values compared to the more traditional on-premise delivery model.
Competition
Our industry is extremely competitive and characterized by: rapid technological change; the emergence of new companies and products; evolving industry standards, computing platforms, go-to-market and business models; and continually changing customer needs.
Our competition can generally be categorized into the following groups:

• | A broad set of start-ups in a number of our product segments that lack near-term profit expectations;


• | Larger incumbents that can bundle software to generate other revenue capture;


• | Increasing adoption of open source solutions that may substitute for commercial spend; and


• | Continued expansion of cloud service provider offerings embedded with management and security capabilities.

Among the companies with which we compete are: Apigee Corporation (recently acquired by Google); AppDynamics, Inc. (recently acquired by Cisco); Atlassian Corporation, Plc; BMC Software Inc.; Compuware Corporation; CyberArk Software, Ltd.; Dell Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; International Business Machines Corporation; Microsoft Corporation; Oracle Corporation; ServiceNow, Inc.; SolarWinds, Inc.; Splunk, Inc.; and VMware, Inc.
We believe our experience managing mission-critical capabilities for major global corporations, our platform and hardware independence, and our deep customer relationships set us apart from other established competitors in the market. Further, we believe we are differentiated from emerging point-product providers by our global reach, breadth and synergy of offerings, and deep industry experience.
Employees
We believe that innovation and invention are the by-products of an inclusive and diverse workplace. Diversity of perspective, experience and thought are key to driving creativity, innovation, and results. We are committed to providing equitable opportunities and giving employees avenues for success - both personally and professionally. We believe that workforce diversity is an important topic in the technology sector, and we are dedicated to moving the conversation on diversity forward.
We had approximately 11,800 and 11,000 employees at March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
