ITEM 1 | Business

Overview
Our Company was founded in 1899. We are a publicly-traded New York corporation whose shares of common stock are listed on the OTCQX (OTCQX: HPHW).  Our corporate headquarters are located in Olathe, Kansas. For over 40 years, our business focus has been on providing health risk assessment services and sample collection services. In 2017, we merged with Provant Health Solutions, LLC ("PHS"), which offers a similar set of services as Hooper Holmes. The combined company provides a personalized, one-stop wellbeing experience for customers, with proven health outcomes powered by sophisticated data collection and management. This uniquely positions us to transform and capitalize on the large and growing health and wellbeing market. On January 23, 2018, we announced that we have re-branded to Hooper Holmes, Inc. d/b/a Provant Health.
We provide on-site screening services and flu shots, laboratory testing, health risk assessment, and sample collection services to individuals as part of comprehensive health and wellbeing programs offered through organizations' sponsorships. Such organizations include corporate and government employers, health plans, hospital systems, health care management companies, wellbeing companies, brokers and consultants, disease management organizations, reward administrators, third party administrators, clinical research organizations and academic institutions. Through our comprehensive health and wellbeing services, we also provide health coaching to support positive health risk migration, access to a wellbeing platform with individual and team challenges and rewards management, interoperability with third party digital health providers, data analytics, and reporting services. We deliver these services nationwide via a network of health professionals, all of whom are trained and certified to deliver quality service. In addition, we leverage our national network of health professionals to support the delivery of other similar products and services. Our Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") certified medical-kit facility provides services to global pharmaceutical companies, and supports the delivery of our products and services in a high-quality, secure manner. 

The majority of large employers that offer health benefits today also offer health and wellbeing programs in an effort to promote employee health and productivity as well as to reduce health-related costs.  Through biometric screening services, plan

sponsors help employees learn of existing and/or potential health risks. Through corporate wellbeing, they provide education and health improvement tools and personalized challenges. Program sponsors also gain the ability to systematically reward employees for good, healthy behaviors and for actual health enhancement metrics. Some common examples of these rewards include reductions in annual medical premiums, contributions to an employee’s Health Savings Account ("HSA"), and credits that are redeemable through an online merchandise mall. By combining both the screening and corporate wellbeing services under a single organization, we create a seamless, end-to-end experience for members and drive improved engagement and outcomes for our clients.
Today, we service approximately 200 direct clients representing nearly 3,000 employers representing over 3,000,000 individual employees. In 2017, we delivered nearly 1,000,000 screenings and are on track to continue year-over-year revenue growth through a combination of serving our direct customers, channel partners, and clinical research organizations as well as through the addition of new customers.
We operate under one reporting segment. Our biometric screening services are subject to seasonality, with the third and fourth quarters typically being our strongest quarters due to increased demand for screening services from mid-August through late-November related to annual benefit renewal cycles as well as the seasonal delivery of flu shots. Engagement in our health and wellbeing service operations are more constant, though there are some variations due to the timing of the health coaching programs which are billed per participant and typically start shortly after the conclusion of onsite screening events. In addition to our screening and health and wellbeing services, we generate ancillary revenue through the assembly of medical kits for sale to third parties.
We believe that the overall market for our screening and health and wellbeing services is growing and we anticipate continued growth with the increased nationwide focus on initiatives that improve healthcare, contain costs, and increase the wellbeing and productivity of employee populations.
Description of Services
Our biometric screening services are performed primarily at employee work locations, typically referred to as onsite screenings, for groups of all sizes, or for individual employees at remote work locations or residences. We provide many options for screening individuals at remote work locations or residences through our national network of health professionals as well as through our agreements with local retail clinics and lab testing centers. The information collected from our services is used by our customers to measure the populations they manage, identify risks in those populations, target intervention programs, promote positive lifestyle behaviors, and measure the results of their health and care management programs.
Our screening services include:

• | scheduling of individual and group screenings and organizing health and wellbeing events;


• | end-to-end screening event management;


• | provision and fulfillment of needed supplies (e.g., examination kits, blood pressure cuffs, stadiometers, scales, centrifuges) at screening events;


• | ScreeningProTM tablet technology that streamlines the screening experience for participants eliminating the need to fill out paper forms;


• | performing biometric health screenings (e.g., height, weight, body mass index, the taking of a person’s hip and waist measurements, as well as his or her pulse, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose and triglycerides);


• | administration of flu shots, cotinine, HbA1c and other specialized testing;


• | coordination of lab testing of blood specimens and other fluids;


• | onsite participant health and wellbeing coaching;


• | onsite health consultation services such as Wellbeing with Provant LiveActivationTM to promote and on-board other wellbeing program initiatives during those meaningful face-to-face teachable moments;


• | data processing and transmission;


• | analytics to identify critical values of lab tests and notification services to individuals and customers to better manage risk;


• | the delivery of other onsite or in-home services, including health professional administration of electroencephalogram ("EEG") tests; and


• | support of data collection for academic and clinical research organizations.

Our comprehensive health and wellness services include:

• | access to a wellness portal;


• | wellness assessments;

• | health coaching for lifestyle and health risk improvement, delivered onsite, telephonically or via mobile app;


• | health coaching for chronic condition management;


• | data analytics and reporting services;


• | communication and engagement services; and


• | wellbeing program advisory services.

We provide screening results on an expedited basis through our web portal that enables participants to access test results immediately.
Market Conditions and Strategic Initiatives
The PricewaterhouseCoopers ("PwC") 2017 Health and Well-being Touchstone survey indicates that 79% of employers offer wellness programs, up from 76% in the prior year survey.  The most common wellness initiative is biometric screening (83% which is up from 77% a year ago), health risk questionnaires (82% also up from 80% in the prior-year survey), followed by tobacco cessation programs which jumped 8 percentage points, (81% up from 73% in the prior-year survey). The prevalence of health coaching increased to 76% from 61% a year ago. The PwC survey further indicates that biometric screenings are not only widely-offered by employers but are also the most utilized by employees. 
The latest 2017 survey on wellness programs from Fidelity Investments and the National Business Group on Health ("NBGH") reveals that employers continue to expand their wellness programs to improve employee health and create a more positive workplace culture.  Moreover, employee incentives continue to play a critical role in the utilization of corporate well-being programs with nearly 75 percent of companies offering incentives to employees. According to the survey, the average employee incentive amount in 2017 increased by $91 to $742 from $651 a year ago.
The survey also indicates a continuation of the trend to expand wellness programs beyond physical activity to focus on other well-being factors that impact productivity such as emotional stress and financial challenges.  According to the survey, more employers are investing in “total wellbeing” programs that address areas such as financial and emotional health.  The survey revealed employers continue to add programs that help employees manage stress, improve their resiliency, and assist with their financial challenges, recognizing a ‘healthy’ employee may be affected by non-health factors, focusing beyond solely physical health.  
There are barriers to achieving employers' goals regarding such wellness programs including motivating participants to participate in screenings and encouraging behavior change based on these results, the unpredictability of health care costs, and the efficacy of health and wellness programs to manage these costs.  Through our health risk assessment and services, we help companies identify and stratify risk of individuals for enrollment in care management programs.  Through our health and wellness services, we tailor and personalize education and interventions, promote positive lifestyle behavior changes, and measure and reward risk reduction. 
Sales and Marketing
We build our customer base through the typical sales management processes, with referrals being the largest source of new business closely followed by traditional requests for proposals. After we qualify new potential customers, we market our solutions to “power and focus” their wellbeing programs while supporting their goal of integrating health and wellbeing into their organizational culture. This may take many forms, from a basic biometric screening to identifying potential health challenges for a participant to address on their own or with their family physician, to robust coaching and life changing activities into which our screening services drive participants.  Our onsite coaching and engagement services, post screening services, answer many basic health questions and help thousands of participants “engage” in the appropriate programs offered by their employers to improve their health. Our coaching services allow participants to build their own personalized goals with achievable action steps and a plan to track progress toward those goals, with education and motivation along the way. Our wellbeing platform and communication/engagement services allow employers to promote their own wellbeing program and goals along with year-round health and wellbeing education, seminars, and challenges to support those goals and help build a greater focus on health and wellbeing company wide.
We believe our fully integrated, end-to-end health and wellbeing solution gives us several competitive advantages in the market. In 2017, we have:

• | expanded our remote access network for biometric screenings;

 3


• | provided value-add services as part of our onsite screenings including flu shots, cotinine and other specialized testing including HbA1C and other many more flexible options;


• | expanded our onsite health consulting services, extending the program to our Channel Partner clients allowing them to increase enrollment into their health coaching programs, cut operational participant outreach costs, and improve the member experience;


• | leveraged our national network of health professionals to support the delivery of other onsite or in-home services, including in-home EEG tests;


• | expanded use of our proprietary ScreeningProTM tablet technology that streamlines the screening experience for participants and eliminates paperwork.

Given our additional capabilities and our diversified sales approaches - direct business, channel partners, and clinical research organizations - we continue to identify additional areas to leverage our assets further expanding into targeted adjacent markets with substantial opportunity and a favorable competitive landscape.
We believe that we are well-positioned for continued growth in the health and care management market given our unique set of assets, our proprietary information technology ("IT") system, our expertise and offerings in the health and wellbeing market, and our national network of quality health professionals. However, the success of our screening and health and wellbeing operations will also depend in part upon the success of our sponsors and their health and care management initiatives to encourage employers to adopt wellbeing programs based on screening results.
Information Technology 
IT systems are the foundation that enables all aspects of our business.  We continue to enhance our IT systems as the need for services, products, and technology requirements advance, and firmly believe that technology can be a competitive differentiator for us.  Our screening teams utilize a proprietary customer order, tracking, and scheduling system that is central to our operations.  We continue to leverage ScreeningProTM, in conjunction with mobile device technology, being the preferred method of accurately collecting data at the point of care to accelerate data transmission and drive meaningful behavior change. Data integrity, driven by the data management system, meticulously inspects and secures screening results for expedient delivery to customers.  In addition, our health and wellbeing teams leverage a proprietary portal platform that can be easily configured to service the diverse needs of our client base.  We continue investing in improving our IT operating systems and leveraging our expertise to enable innovation that meets or exceeds the needs of our customers.
During 2017, we continued the use of state-of-the-art data centers that employ multi-factor security, 24-7 camera monitoring, and a power supply with redundant generator backing.  We also continued to utilize our highly available and secure private cloud operating environment leveraging converged infrastructure that has maintained a core uptime of 100% for three years running.  As we look ahead to 2018, efforts will continue around innovation that drives efficiencies and advances our technological capabilities in the health and wellbeing market.
Our Customers
We sell direct to corporations, clinical research organizations and through a reseller network. We provide comprehensive well-being programs to employers in the Fortune 1000 including some in the Fortune 50. Our clinical research organization utilizes our screening services for sample and data collection. Within our reseller network of health plans and wellness providers, we provide our partners with white label support for screening services, flu shots and data management. In total, we serve over 3,000 employers, over 200 direct customers and more than 30 channel partners.
We had one customer, JPMorgan Chase, who accounted for over 10% of consolidated revenue in the year ended December 31, 2017. Our two largest customers in 2016, American Healthways Services, Inc. and IncentiSoft Solutions, LLC, were just over 30% of consolidated revenue. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We have agreements with each of our customers, although these agreements do not provide for specific minimum levels of purchase.
Competition
Our competition is largely fragmented. For screening services, the market consists primarily of private companies that provide screening services to certain geographies in the United States, limiting their market coverage. There are a small number of competitors who have the ability to service customers nationally. For the health and wellbeing market, there are many companies in this space including established wellbeing and care management providers, startup companies, health plans offering their own proprietary solutions, and more. Many of these companies outsource key elements of their programs (including screening services), 
 4

leaving our company as one of the only health and wellbeing providers offering a fully integrated, start to finish screening and wellbeing solution.
In addition to direct screening and health and wellbeing services (i.e., direct contracts with corporate and government employers, health plans, hospital systems, etc.), we provide screening services for many health care management companies, wellbeing companies, brokers and consultants, disease management organizations, reward administrators, and third-party administrators (our “channel partner” customers). Several of the health and care management companies and wellbeing companies, in turn, serve their own suite of large employer groups, which allows us to tap into new business through these indirect sub-contractor relationships. We also provide specialized screening and data collection services for clinical research organizations and academic institutions across the country.
Leaders within the wellbeing market win on technology, engagement, and outcomes. We believe the combination of our infrastructure, screening capabilities, and national network of experienced health professionals combined with our scalable technology and engagement platform, health coaches, and analytics tools positions us to become a leader in the growing health and wellbeing market.
Governmental Regulation
We are subject to federal and state regulations relating to the collection, testing, transportation, handling, and disposal of the various specimens obtained in the course of a wellness screening, such as Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”). The health professionals we utilize are subject to certain licensing and certification requirements and regulations with respect to the drawing of blood and needle disposal, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”). In addition, many of the services we provide are subject to certain provisions of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”), other federal and state laws relating to the privacy of health and other personal information, and state and federal laws designed to guard against healthcare fraud and abuse.
CLIA
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") regulates all laboratory testing (except research) performed on humans in the U.S. through the CLIA. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the Center for Clinical Standards and Quality ("CCSQ") has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA Program. The objective of the CLIA program is to ensure the quality of laboratory testing. All clinical laboratories must be properly certified to receive Medicare or Medicaid payments.
OSHA
The federal, OSHA blood-borne pathogens standard, as amended pursuant to the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act of 2000, prescribes safeguards to protect workers against the health hazards caused by bloodborne pathogens. Its requirements address items such as exposure control plans, universal precautions, engineering and work practice controls, personal protective equipment, housekeeping, laboratories, hepatitis B vaccination, post-exposure follow-up, hazard communication and training, and record keeping. The standard places requirements on employers whose workers can be reasonably anticipated to contact blood or other potentially infectious materials. Some states operate their own OSHA-approved state program, which state programs are required to adopt a bloodborne pathogens standard that is at least as effective as the Federal OSHA standard.
HIPAA, Privacy Laws, and Data Security
Federal Privacy Laws
The HIPAA Privacy Standards and Security Standards under establish a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers (referred to as “covered entities”) and their “business associates,” which are persons or entities that perform certain services for or on behalf of a covered entity (or another business associate) that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. As a “business associate”, we are subject to HIPAA with regard to certain aspects of our business, such as managing employee or plan member health information for employers or health plans. With respect to our services platform and related services, HITECH creates obligations for us to report any unauthorized use or disclosure of protected health information, known as a breach, to our covered entity customers. Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties.
 5

As part of the payment-related aspects of our business, we may also undertake security-related obligations arising out of the USA Patriot Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Payment Card Industry guidelines applicable to card systems. These requirements generally require safeguards for the protection of personal and other payment related information.
State Privacy Laws
In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations, or state privacy laws, that govern the use and disclosure of a person’s medical information or records and, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. These state privacy laws include regulation of health insurance providers and agents, regulation of organizations that perform certain administrative functions such as utilization review or third-party administration, issuance of notices regarding privacy practices, and reporting and providing access to law enforcement authorities. These laws may require us to modify our operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state privacy laws or be subject to applicable sanctions.
Healthcare Fraud Statutes
Federal statute identifies a class of federal crimes known as the “federal healthcare offenses,” including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits payment of remuneration to induce referrals of federal or state healthcare program beneficiaries. The Federal Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, and the Federal Health Care Benefit Program False Statements Statute prohibits, among other things, concealing a material fact or making a materially false statement in connection with the payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Violation of these statutes is punishable by fines and/or imprisonment. Most states have similar statutes relating to state (and sometimes private) healthcare benefit plans.
False Claims Act
The Federal Civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. There are also state law corollaries to the Federal False Claims Act.
Regulation of Wellness Incentive Programs
The HIPAA Nondiscrimination Provisions generally prohibit group health plans from charging similarly situated individuals different premiums or contributions or imposing different deductible, co-payment, or other cost-sharing requirements based on a “health factor.” Such differentials are, however, acceptable under the HIPAA Nondiscrimination Provisions if the differentials are applied through “wellness programs.” The Department of Labor, in coordination with the Departments of the Treasury and HHS, has issued regulations (finalized in 2013) that define “wellness programs” for purposes of the HIPAA nondiscrimination provisions, establishing specific requirements for wellness programs that reward participants who satisfy a standard related to a health factor (referred to as “health-contingent wellness programs”) and for other types of wellness programs. Programs that do not meet these requirements may be subject to enforcement actions.
Consumer Protection Laws
Federal and state consumer protection laws are being increasingly enforced by the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), and the various state’s attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or patient information, though websites or otherwise, to regulate the presentation of website content, and to regulate direct marketing, including telemarketing and telephonic communication. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, concerning consumer notice, choice, security and access.
Americans with Disabilities Act
The Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") prohibits discrimination on the basis of an employee’s disability or perceived disability. Among other things, it limits employers from inquiring about the disabilities of employees unless the questions are job-related and consistent with business necessity. The ADA also limits the circumstances in which an employer may require physical examinations or answers to medical inquiries. However, the ADA allows employers to conduct voluntary medical examinations and activities, including voluntary medical histories, as part of a voluntary wellness program. A wellness program is “voluntary” if the employer neither requires participation nor penalizes employees who do not participate. Records acquired as part of a wellness 
 6

program must be kept confidential and may not be used for a discriminatory purpose. Many states and localities provide similar protections to employees.
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act ("GINA") restricts the collection or use of genetic information for underwriting purposes, and treats the offering of incentives or disincentives for completing an Health Reimbursement Arrangement ("HRA") or participating in a wellness program as underwriting.
Food and Drug Administration
Our medical device and kit assembly business is subject to federal regulations administered by the FDA. The FDA has broad enforcement powers, has the right to conduct audits of our kit assembly facility, and can impose substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance with applicable regulations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 335 employees, which includes 307 full -time employees.  For the full year 2017, we also engaged over 4,700 health professionals from our network of over 20,000 to provide our screening services. Additionally, we engage a seasonal workforce which varies based on the timing and volume of our screening services. 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 319 employees, including 178 full-time employees.  For the full year 2016, we also engaged over 1,500 health professionals to provide our screening services.
