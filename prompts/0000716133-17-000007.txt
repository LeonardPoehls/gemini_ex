Item 1. Business 
Overview and Strategy
Cincinnati Bell Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Cincinnati Bell", "we", "our", "us" or the "Company") provides integrated communications and IT solutions that keep residential and business customers connected with each other and with the world. Through its Entertainment and Communications segment, the company provides high speed data, video, and voice solutions to consumers and businesses over an expanding fiber network and a legacy copper network. In addition, business customers across the United States rely on Cincinnati Bell Technology Solutions Inc. ("CBTS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary reported as the IT Services and Hardware segment, for the sale and service of efficient, end-to-end communications and IT systems and solutions. 
Our goal is to continue the transformation of Cincinnati Bell from a legacy copper-based telecommunications company into a technology company with state of the art fiber assets servicing customers with data, video, voice and IT solutions to meet their evolving needs. To this end, leveraging our past and future investments creates a company with a healthy balance sheet, growing revenue, growing profitability and sustainable cash flows. 
In an effort to achieve our objectives, we continue to focus on the following key initiatives:
•continue to expand our local fiber network
•grow our IT Services and Hardware segment
•monetize our remaining CyrusOne investment
Continue to expand our local fiber network
We invested $230.6 million of capital in Entertainment and Communications' strategic products during 2016. Revenue from these high demand products totaled $449.5 million, up 23% over the prior year, and more than offset the decline in our legacy products. The primary focus of our strategic investments is the expansion of our Fioptics suite of products which is designed to compete directly with the cable Multiple System Operators ("MSO") serving the Company’s operating territory. In 2016 we invested $180.3 million in Fioptics as demand for the products remains strong. Year-over-year growth is outlined in the table below:

 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014 
Fioptics revenue (in millions): | $254.1 | $190.8 | | $142.4
Fioptics subscribers (in thousands): | | | | 
High-speed internet | 197.6 | | 153.7 | | 113.7
Video | 137.6 | | 114.4 | | 91.4 
Voice | 96.2 | | 77.4 | | 61.0 

During the year we passed an additional 101,400 addresses with Fioptics and as of December 31, 2016, the product is available to approximately 533,400 customer locations, or 67% of Greater Cincinnati. Our goal is to pass an additional 35,000 addresses during 2017.
Included in capital for strategic products is $50.3 million of investment in fiber and IP-based core network technology to meet increased business and carrier demand primarily within Greater Cincinnati and in contiguous markets in the Midwest region for high-bandwidth data transport products, such as metro-ethernet and VoIP. We continue to evolve and optimize network assets to support the migration of legacy products to new technology and as of December 31, 2016, the Company has:

• | connected approximately 7,200 commercial addresses with fiber-based services (also referred to as a lit address) during 2016 increasing the total number of lit addresses to 15,800 (included in Fioptics addresses);

•expanded the fiber network to span more than 9,600 route miles; and

• | provided cell site back-haul services to more than 70% of the 1,100 cell sites in-market, of which approximately 500 are lit with fiber.

As a result of our strategic investments, we generated year-over-year Entertainment and Communications revenue growth each year since 2013. Customer demand for faster data speed and broadband usage is accelerating. We believe our fiber investments are a long-term solution for our customers bandwidth needs. 
Grow our IT Services and Hardware Segment
Cincinnati Bell continues to develop high-demand products for business customers through our investments in fiber and other success-based technology, such as unified communications and cloud services. Our ability to migrate customers from legacy copper-based products to higher speed fiber-based offerings while being innovative as the technology demands of our customers change is important to the growth of our IT Services and Hardware segment. During 2016, the IT Services and Hardware segment generated 10% strategic revenue growth on continued strong demand for cloud services. Our goal is to foster our current enterprise relationships while increasing our number of small to mid-size customers both within and outside the Cincinnati market. As a company with a long history of managing customer network and technology needs, we combine the management of the network, whether owned by Cincinnati Bell or leased from other carriers out of territory, with integrated voice and IT offerings. We supply the architecture and integration intelligence, labor and hardware, as well as any combination of these services. These projects can be established based on hourly billing rates, service-level driven agreements or utility-based usage models. Customers are attracted to our ability to combine our historic knowledge, unique assets and talented workforce. 
Monetize our remaining CyrusOne investment
We completed the initial public offering ("IPO") of CyrusOne Inc. ("CyrusOne") during the first quarter of 2013. At the time of the IPO, we effectively owned 69% of CyrusOne held in the form of 1.9 million unregistered common shares of CyrusOne and 42.6 million economically equivalent partnership units in its underlying operating entity CyrusOne LP. The fair value of our ownership as of the IPO date was approximately $943 million. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, we have opportunistically monetized approximately 94% of our original investment for proceeds totaling $1,189.5 million, which have primarily been used to repay debt. Our total debt as of December 31, 2012, prior to the IPO, was $2,666.0 million compared to $1,206.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Interest payments have decreased from $179.5 million in 2013 to $71.1 million in 2016. 
As of December 31, 2016, we owned 2.8 million CyrusOne common shares with a fair value of $128.0 million based on quoted market prices on that date. In determining the appropriate time to further monetize our CyrusOne investment, we will give due consideration to, among other factors, CyrusOne's stock price, market performance of other real estate investment trusts ("REITS") and overall market indicators. Subsequent to December 31, 2016 we sold approximately 2 million CyrusOne common shares for cash proceeds of approximately $100 million.

Entertainment and Communications 
The Entertainment and Communications segment provides products and services such as high-speed internet, data transport, local voice, long distance, VoIP, video and other services. Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC ("CBT"), a subsidiary of the Company, is the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier ("ILEC") for a geography that covers a radius of approximately 25 miles around Cincinnati, Ohio, and includes parts of northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. CBT has operated in this territory for over 140 years. The segment also provides voice and data services beyond its ILEC territory, particularly in Dayton and Mason, Ohio, through the operations of Cincinnati Bell Extended Territories LLC ("CBET"), a competitive local exchange carrier ("CLEC") and subsidiary of CBT. The Entertainment and Communications segment provides long distance and VoIP services primarily through its Cincinnati Bell Any Distance Inc. ("CBAD") and eVolve Business Solutions LLC ("eVolve") subsidiaries. The key products and services provided by the Entertainment and Communications segment include the following:
Data
The Company's data products include high-speed internet access, data transport and interconnection services. Consumer demand for increased internet speeds is accelerating and more customers are opting for higher bandwidth solutions such as Fioptics. To address this demand, we are able to provide internet speeds of 30 megabits or more to approximately 67% of Greater Cincinnati, of which approximately 392,000 addresses are capable of receiving gigabit service.
As business customers migrate from legacy products and copper-based technology, our metro-ethernet product becomes the access method of choice due to its ability to support multiple applications on a single physical connection. The Company continues to build out fiber to multi-tenant units ("MTU's") in Greater Cincinnati to meet growing demand for these services. We are also expanding our metro-ethernet platform to deliver services across a wider geography to target business customers beyond our ILEC footprint. The Company’s regional network connects Greater Cincinnati, Columbus, and Dayton, Ohio, as well as Indianapolis, Indiana; Chicago, Illinois; and Louisville, Kentucky. 
Voice
Voice represents local service, including Fioptics voice lines. It also includes VoIP, long distance, digital trunking, switched access and other value-added services such as caller identification, voicemail, call waiting and call return.
The Company's voice access lines continue to decrease as our customers have increasingly employed wireless technologies in lieu of wireline voice services ("wireless substitution") or migrated to competitors.
Residential and business customers purchasing traditional long distance service can choose from a variety of long distance plans, which include unlimited long distance for a flat fee, purchase of minutes at a per-minute-of-use rate, or a fixed number of minutes for a flat fee. The Company's long distance lines and related minutes of use have continued to decline as a result of wireless substitution and the migration to VoIP technology. Our VoIP products provide access to widely disbursed communication platforms and access to our cloud based services and hosted unified communications products for customers ranging from small businesses to large enterprise customers.
Video
The Company launched Fioptics in 2009 and initially focused our fiber network investment on densely populated areas, such as apartments and condominiums. Since that time, Fioptics has been deployed over a much broader base and is now available to approximately 67% of Greater Cincinnati. As of December 31, 2016, we have 137,600 video subscribers. Our Fioptics customers enjoy access to over 400 entertainment channels including digital music, local, movie and sports programming with over 140 high-definition channels, parental controls, HD DVR and video On-Demand. In addition, we offer features that deliver high customer satisfaction including Fioptics MyTV which provides a more customized packaging of channels resulting in lower prices for our customers and a Fioptics live TV streaming application. 
Services and Other
Services and other revenue consists of revenue generated from wiring projects for business customers, advertising, directory assistance, maintenance and information services.

Telecom and IT Hardware
The Company maintains premium resale relationships and certifications with a variety of branded technology vendors which allows it to competitively sell, architect and install a wide array of telecommunications and IT infrastructure equipment to meet the needs of its customers. 
Sales and Distribution Channels
The Company’s Entertainment and Communications segment utilizes a number of distribution channels to acquire customers. As of December 31, 2016, the Company operated eight retail stores in its operating territory to market and distribute our Fioptics suite of products. The Company works to locate retail stores in high traffic but affordable areas, with a distance between each store that considers optimal returns per store and customer convenience. The Company also offers fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of various other Company services and accessories. In addition, the Company utilizes a call center as well as a door-to-door sales force to target the sale of our consumer products to residents. 
For both operating segments, we utilize a business-to-business sales force and a call center organization to reach business customers in our operating territory. Larger business customers are supported by sales account representatives that understand the customer's technology needs and recommend Company offered solutions. Smaller business customers are supported through a telemarketing sales force, customer representatives and store locations. 
Suppliers and Product Supply Chain
The Company generally subjects purchases to competitive bids and selects its vendors based on price, service level, delivery terms, quality of product and terms and conditions. 
Entertainment and Communication’s primary purchases are for network equipment, software, and fiber cable to maintain and support the growth of Fioptics. The Company maintains facilities and operations for storing cable and other equipment, product distribution and customer fulfillment. 
IT Services and Hardware primarily purchases IT and telephony equipment that is either sold to a customer or used to provide service to the customer. The Company is a certified distributor of Cisco, EMC, Avaya and Oracle equipment. Most of this equipment is shipped directly to the customer from vendor locations, but the Company does maintain warehouse facilities for replacement parts and equipment testing and staging. 
In addition, we have long-term commitments to outsource various services, such as certain information technology functions, cash remittance and accounts payable functions, call center operations and maintenance services. 
Competition
The telecommunications industry is very competitive, and the Company competes against larger, well-capitalized national providers.
The Entertainment and Communications segment faces competition from other local exchange carriers, wireless service providers, inter-exchange carriers, as well as cable, broadband, and internet service providers. The Company has lost, and will likely continue to lose, access lines as a part of its customer base utilizes the services of competitive wireline or wireless providers in lieu of the Company’s services. Wireless providers, particularly those that provide unlimited wireless service plans with no additional fees for long distance, offer customers a substitution service for the Company’s local voice and long-distance services. The Company believes wireless substitution is the reason for the largest portion of the Company’s access line and long-distance line losses. 
Our strategic products also face intense competition from cable operators, other telecom companies and niche fiber companies. Many of our competitors have lower operating costs and access to resources that provide economies of scale allowing them to more aggressively price products which they are able to provide on a much broader scale given their expanded geographic operations. Our competitors continuously upgrade their service quality and offerings which could substantially erode the competitive advantage we currently have with our fiber-based products. These competitive factors could limit the Company's ability to grow revenue and cash flows despite the strategic initiatives implemented.

The Fioptics suite of products also face competition from a number of different sources, including companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Increasingly, content owners are utilizing Internet-based delivery of content directly to consumers, some without charging a fee for access to the content. Furthermore, due to consumer electronics innovations, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices. Increased customer migration to these non-traditional entertainment products could result in increased Fioptics churn and decreased penetration.
The IT Services and Hardware segment competes against numerous other information technology consulting, web-hosting, and computer system integration companies, many of which are larger in scope and well-financed. The Company believes that participants in this market must grow rapidly and achieve significant scale to compete effectively. Other competitors may consolidate with larger companies or acquire software application vendors or technology providers, enabling them to more effectively compete. This consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that could impede the ability of these businesses to compete successfully in the market. 
Customers

The Company has sales with one customer, General Electric Company ("GE"), that contributed to 12% of the Company’s annual revenue in each of 2016 and 2015.
Employees 
At December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 3,400 employees and approximately 30% of its employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement with the Communications Workers of America (“CWA”), which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO. The current contract with the CWA was ratified on February 27, 2015 and is in effect through May 12, 2018.
