General 

We are an innovator and global provider of light emitting diode (“LED”) lighting technology. We design, develop and market advanced, environmentally sustainable and differentiated illumination solutions that use LEDs as their exclusive light source. Our product portfolio includes LED-based retrofit lamps (replacement bulbs) used in existing light fixtures as well as purpose-built LED-based luminaires (light fixtures). Our lamps and luminaires are used for many common indoor and outdoor residential, commercial, industrial and public infrastructure lighting applications. We have also developed LED lighting technology that emits light at frequencies calibrated along the visible spectrum to achieve specific biological effects.

Our in-house design of power supplies, thermal management solutions and optical systems, along with our detailed specification of the packaged LEDs incorporated into our products, provides us with a unique ability to manage the interrelationships between components and subsystems. This system-based approach enables us to provide a broad range of solutions that deliver a high quality combination of lighting efficacy and reliability. In addition, we believe we can leverage our strong supply chain and sourcing capabilities to support an “all channels” go-to-market strategy and to deliver differentiated lighting solutions at competitive price points.
 
Our customers include retailers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that sell our products on a co-branded or private label basis. Large retail, hospitality and other corporate customers also purchase products from us directly. In addition, our luminaires are utilized in large-scale infrastructure projects throughout the world. 
 
We are seeking to lead the convergence of science and light to improve the environment as well as human health and well-being. Our lighting technology is designed to consume less electricity for each unit of light produced and we continue to improve our product packaging and lifespan to use fewer materials in the production and distribution of our lamps and luminaires.

On March 20, 2017, we formed LSG MLS JV Holdings, Inc. (“LSG JV Holdings”) as a subsidiary and entered into an operating agreement with MLS Co., Ltd. (“MLS”) relating to the formation of Global Value Lighting, LLC (“GVL”). GVL was formed as a joint venture between us and MLS for the purpose of carrying out the manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of private label LED lighting products and services to retail and commercial customers in North America and South America. The joint venture is an integral part of our long-term strategy (the “Joint Venture”). We believe the Joint Venture will allow GVL to focus on the private label LED business, which to date has represented a significant portion of our revenues, while allowing us to focus on our technology business featuring product lines such as its proprietary HealthE™, VividGro®, and FreeLED™, which will be operated independently from GVL. The Joint Venture remains subject to certain closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Joint Venture, we (through LSG JV Holdings) will make an initial capital contribution of $5.1 million in cash to GVL, and MLS will make an initial capital contribution of $4.9 million in cash to GVL. Upon the determination of the board of managers of GVL, each of LSG JV Holdings and MLS will be required to make additional capital contributions of up to $7.65 million and $7.35 million in the aggregate, respectively, during the first 12 months following the closing date. LSG JV Holdings will own 51% of the membership interests of GVL and MLS will own 49% of the membership interests of GVL.

Our Products 
 
We have an extensive product portfolio with three distinct offerings—replacement lamps, luminaires and biological (or spectrum control) lighting. The products in each of these offerings achieve a unique combination of scientific innovation, lumen distribution and energy efficiency. We enhanced our product line during 2016 with the introduction of several new products, including our Genesis Dynaspectrum™ (the first commercially-available luminaire focusing on users’ health and productivity), the Durabulb (a shatter-resistant lamp), and the L-Bar™ (a high-performance linear lighting solution). Combined with the introduction of new products in 2015, including the Free LED solar roadway system, our Vintage™ Filament Series of LED lamps, our Sleepy Baby™ LED lamp, a new mini-roadway luminaire and our VividGro agricultural grow light product, we anticipate that our new products will provide improved performance relative to our legacy products through the implementation of more effective components and form factors.
    
Replacement Lamps. We offer a broad range of LED retrofit lamps designed to fit into existing light fixtures as replacements for traditional incandescent, compact fluorescent and halogen lamps. Our dimmable LED retrofit lamps possess consistent color and deliver improved light distribution and brightness in commercial and residential settings as compared to traditional lighting products. Our replacement lamp product line includes lamps that are sold under the Lighting Science® brand as well as co-branded and private label retrofit lamps offered directly to our customers and through distributors across North America. In January 2015, we launched the Vintage Filament Series of LED lamps in many of the traditional, incandescent bulb decorative form factors but with greater energy savings than their traditional counterparts.
 
Luminaires. We offer LED luminaires that combine energy efficiency, long life span and enhanced light distribution, making them ideal for street lighting and lighting in parking garages, outdoor areas, warehouses and manufacturing areas. In February 2015, we introduced the FreeLED solar roadway system, a sleek, intelligent and powerful street lighting solution that uses solar energy as its power source. We believe the FreeLED will provide a reliable, affordable and sustainable roadway illumination solution for the general public, including those rural or remote communities with limited access to the electric grid.
 
Biological Lighting. Our biological lighting product line incorporates our patented technology to emit light at frequencies calibrated along the visible spectrum to achieve specific biological effects. Our current line of biological products can be used to induce a sleep, awake or transition state as well as to effectively and efficiently modify and enhance the circadian rhythm of certain agricultural products to optimize growth in terms of both time and energy efficiency. Our biological lighting product line includes the Good Night™ and Good Day™ circadian replacement lamps, the VividGro grow light product, the MyNature™ Coastal lamps and outdoor luminaires and the MyNature Grow lighting lamps and high bay luminaires. In March 2015, building on the proprietary technology underlying our popular Good Night lamp, we released the Sleepy Baby lamp, which delivers a patented, biologically-corrected light source for use during a baby’s nightly bedtime routine, sending natural signals to promote sleep and child wellness. The GoodNight lamp has a patented spectral filter that greatly reduces blue light and supports the body’s natural melatonin production. The GoodDay lamp has a blue enriched spectrum to naturally enhance the body’s energy and alertness. Our coastal lighting solutions have been installed at Patrick Air Force Base and other locations along Florida’s east coast. In addition, numerous commercial and academic greenhouses and growing facilities across the United States and Canada have implemented our MyNature Grow solutions.
 

Target Markets and Customers 

We focus our product development on the applications and markets in which the return on investment, total cost of ownership and other benefits of LED lighting currently offer clear and compelling incentives for customers. In particular, we seek to improve our brand awareness and sales pipeline in major urban areas both in the United States and abroad in the market segments discussed below. Historically we relied on our relationship with The Home Depot, Inc. (“The Home Depot”) for a significant portion of our revenue, although we are working to diversify our customer base and product sales in 2017 and beyond, as we now are aggressively marketing our products to other big box stores and retailers.

Residential and office. We offer a line of retrofit lamps, integrated retrofit kits and luminaires designed to compete with traditional incandescent, florescent and halogen lamps and luminaires for commercial and residential lighting applications. Our retrofit lamps and luminaires targeted for this market are currently sold to distributors and OEMs that resell them both directly to end-users and into retail channels under the Lighting Science brand and, at times, under the distributors’ and OEMs’ own brands. We also have a comprehensive assortment of retrofit lamps and luminaires that we market and sell through our website under the Lighting Science brand.
 
Retail and hospitality. The market for lighting in the retail and hospitality environment is large and varied. We believe our lighting products are particularly well suited for the retail and hospitality segment, including applications in malls, retail stores, hotels and resorts, cruise ships and restaurants. Our retrofit lamp and luminaire offerings for this market focus on task, down, bay, cove, linear, accent, track and spot lighting as well as retail display lighting. Several major U.S. retailers have replaced their existing lighting with our LED retrofit lamps and luminaires. We believe that our biological lighting technology may provide us with a unique competitive advantage in this market segment.
 
Government-owned and private infrastructure. Public and private infrastructure includes outdoor facilities and spaces that are managed by government and private entities. Primary applications for our products in this market include lighting for streets and highways, parking lots, airports, ports, utilities and other large outdoor areas, particularly in developing nations. Street and highway lighting represents the largest segment within the infrastructure market. 
  
Schools and universities. Buildings and outdoor lighting for primary, secondary and higher education represent a significant market opportunity for our energy-efficient solutions. This opportunity results in part from the movement across K-12 institutions, as well as colleges and universities, to reduce energy use and environmental impact as well as improve sustainability. We believe that switching to LED lighting is one of the most practical, readily implementable, highest-return, and high profile actions campus administrators can take towards fulfilling this mandate. Principal applications in this market include lighting for parking lots, large outdoor areas, streets and building exteriors, as well as indoor lighting in classrooms and common areas. 
 
Sales Channels 
 
We employ an “all channels” go-to-market strategy that addresses distinct market opportunities through branded and co-branded private label programs, our direct sales force, distributors and independent sales agents, as well as partnerships and joint ventures. 
 
Our strategic account management team focuses on developing new business alliances and managing our existing branded lighting and OEM relationships. In addition to its business development initiatives, our strategic account management team seeks to expand our revenue from our current accounts by providing ongoing energy analysis, market expertise and support to such customers. 
 
Our national account management team focuses on finding new, potentially high-value customers and providing professional support to our current roster of end-users. This team targets and supports retail, hospitality, schools and universities, large real estate management and energy service company customers. 
 
Our project-focused activities involve supporting our network of independent sales agents and distributors that pursue lighting projects in the commercial, industrial and public infrastructure markets on a regional basis, including opportunities for projects in international markets. Our project-focused sales team develops and manages our network of channel partners and works with these partners to submit competitive bids on projects, and oversees the delivery and after-market support related to such projects. 
 
Research and Development 
 
To successfully implement our business strategy, we must continually improve our current products and develop new products for existing and new applications. Our research and development team focuses on advanced technological applications that not only increase the efficiency of the components and subsystems that make up our products, but also add capabilities such as controls, adaptability and biological technology. Components and subsystems include power supplies, thermal management solutions, optical systems and LEDs.

Our research and development team also seeks to enhance the aesthetic appeal and reduce the total cost of ownership of our products. Although we implemented a number of cost cutting measures during the past three years, including reductions in personnel, we intend to continue to dedicate a significant portion of our financial and personnel resources toward the development of new materials and methods related to our products.

Our research and development team is comprised of 12 research scientists and engineers, many with Doctoral or Masters Degrees in disciplines such as power electronics, lighting, thermal and mechanical engineering, materials science and cellular and molecular biology. These professionals combine a thorough understanding of the sciences required to develop LED lighting products with extensive experience in the lighting industry. Our research and development capabilities are further enhanced through collaborations with leaders within and outside the LED lighting industry. We have research and development relationships with professionals and institutions in a wide range of fields, including advanced material science, semiconductor performance, medical and biological research, space exploration and military applications. These institutions include leading research organizations, such as NASA, Harvard, Jefferson Medical College, Florida Institute of Technology, University of Guelph and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, as well as leading technology-oriented companies such as Bayer AG and National Semiconductor Corporation. In addition, we have supported and continue to contribute to research including advanced material processing and biological effects of lighting on plants and animals, including a recent study performed at Harvard and an on-going study at Alertness CRC Limited investigating the effects of lighting on human sleep patterns. 

Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $3.3 million, $4.0 million and $5.6 million, respectively. We have reduced research and development expenses year-over-year since 2014 as part of our overall cost-cutting strategy, which is a key component of our on-going efforts to improve our financial results. We expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expenses are reported net of any funding received under contracts with governmental agencies or commercial customers that are considered to be cost-sharing arrangements with no contractually committed deliverable.

Manufacturing and Suppliers 

During the past three years, we have increasingly focused on our design and engineering competencies in an effort to develop differentiated products. Accordingly, we design and engineer our products and outsource substantially all of the manufacture and assembly of our products to a number of contract manufacturers internationally. These contract manufacturers purchase components based on our specifications and provide the necessary facilities and labor to manufacture our products. We allocate the production of specific products to the contract manufacturer we believe is best suited to manufacture the product. Quality control and lot testing is conducted at our contract manufacturers in Asia. Product qualification and testing is conducted in our facilities in Cocoa Beach, Florida. Our Cocoa Beach facility and each of our contract manufacturers have been ISO9001:2008 certified as conforming to the standards published by the International Organization for Standardization. If the proposed Joint Venture transaction with MLS closes, GVL will engage MLS as its exclusive manufacturer of certain LED lighting products.
  
We select LEDs based on a combination of availability, price and performance. We believe we have strong relationships with our LED suppliers and receive a high level of cooperation and support from them. In addition, we have entered into strategic relationships with certain of these key LED suppliers that currently give us access to next generation LED technology at an early stage and at competitive prices. Certain of our biological products use a custom LED package that we source from a limited number of suppliers.
 
Competition 
 
Our products face competition in the general lighting market from both traditional lighting technologies produced by numerous vendors as well as from LED-based lighting products produced by a growing roster of industry participants. LED lighting products compete with traditional lighting technologies on the basis of the numerous benefits of LED lighting relative to such technology including greater energy efficiency, longer lifetime, improved durability, increased environmental sustainability, digital controllability, smaller size, directionality and lower heat output. 
 
The LED lighting industry is characterized by rapid technological change, short product lifecycles and frequent new product introductions and a competitive pricing environment. These characteristics create a market environment that demands continuous innovation, provides entry points for new competitors and creates opportunities for rapid shifts in market share. We primarily compete with other providers of LED lighting on the basis of our product performance, as measured by efficacy, light quality, increased lumen output and reliability relative to industry standards and energy related certifications, such as ENERGY STAR and California Energy Commission specifications, as well as on product cost. In addition to these factors, which generally contribute to a lower total cost of ownership and enhanced product quality as compared to alternative lighting solutions, we offer our customers a broad product portfolio. We believe our product design approach, proprietary technology and deep understanding of lighting applications aids our ability to compete in the market for LED lighting. 
 
Currently, we view our primary competition to be from large, established companies in the traditional general lighting industry. Certain of these companies also provide, or have undertaken initiatives to develop, LED lighting products as well as other energy efficient lighting products. Additionally, we face competition from a fragmented group of smaller niche or low-cost offshore providers of LED lighting products. We also anticipate that larger LED chip manufacturers, including some of those that currently supply us, will continue to seek to compete with us. For example, our largest customer, The Home Depot, performed a periodic product line review relating to its entire private label LED lighting product offering in June 2015. In connection with this line review, The Home Depot elected to purchase certain products previously supplied by us directly from overseas suppliers, including one of our suppliers. We also expect other large technology players with packaged LED chip technology that are currently focused on other end markets for LEDs, such as backlighting for LCD displays, to increasingly focus on the general illumination market as their existing markets saturate and LED use in general illumination grows. In addition, we may compete in the future with vendors of new technological solutions for energy efficient lighting.

Intellectual Property 
 
Our intellectual property portfolio is a key aspect of our product differentiation strategy. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies by obtaining patents and licenses, retaining trade secrets and, when appropriate, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights. We believe this strategy optimizes our ability to preserve the advantages of our products and technologies and improves the return on our investment in research and development. 


  As of December 31, 2016, we had obtained 293 patents from the United States Patent Office (the “USPTO”), with another 4 applications allowed and 23 pending, as well as 96 foreign patents, with another three allowed and 29 pending from various jurisdictions outside of the United States. These patents and patent applications cover various inventions related to the design and manufacture of LED lighting technology.  During 2016, we filed 23 new U.S. patent applications and 31 U.S. patents were issued to us by the USPTO. When it is appropriate and cost effective, we make corresponding international, regional or national filings to pursue patent protection in other parts of the world. In certain cases, we rely on confidentiality agreements and trade secret protections to defend our proprietary technology. In addition, we license and have cross-licensing arrangements with respect to third-party technologies that are incorporated into elements of our design activities, products and manufacturing processes. Where appropriate, we also license certain of our intellectual property to third parties to further monetize our intellectual property portfolio.
  
The LED lighting industry is characterized by the existence of a significant number of patents and other intellectual property and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. We believe that our extensive intellectual property portfolio, along with our license arrangements, provides us with a considerable advantage relative to new entrants to the industry and smaller LED lighting providers in serving sophisticated customers. 
 
We also intend to continue to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties. In 2016, we settled claims against 11 companies in which we sought damages and injunctive relief in response to such companies’ alleged infringement of our patent rights. We received payments of $1.8 million during 2016 from those companies as a result of those settlements. In 2015, we filed four lawsuits against third parties seeking damages and injunctive relief in response to such third parties’ infringement of our patent rights. Four other companies agreed to take a patent license and pay royalties to us. In addition, in April 2015, we filed a lawsuit against several former employees and the company they formed seeking damages and injunctive relief arising out of the defendants’ misappropriation of our trade secrets and other intellectual property. Pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement, the defendants agreed not to use or disclose our intellectual property and to reimburse us $200,000 in costs, and the defendants’ company agreed to pay to us a commission equal to the greater of (i) $1.7 million and (ii) 5% of the infringing company’s gross sales of biological and agricultural products during the three-year period ending January 2019.
    As is customary in the LED lighting industry, many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any intellectual property rights claims against us or our customers and/or distributors, we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product, pay damages and expend significant resources to defend against the claim and/or develop non-infringing technology, seek a license or relinquish patents or other intellectual property rights. 
  
Regulations, Standards and Conventions 
 
Our products are generally required to comply with and satisfy the electrical codes of the jurisdictions in which they are sold. We design our products to meet the typically more stringent codes established in the United States and the European Union, which usually allows our products to meet the codes in other geographic regions. 
 
Many of our customers require our products to be certified by Underwriters’ Laboratories, Inc. (“UL”). UL is a U.S.-based independent, nationally recognized testing laboratory, and third-party product safety testing and certification organization. UL develops standards and test procedures for products, materials, components, assemblies, tools and equipment, primarily dealing with product safety. UL evaluates products, components, materials and systems for compliance to specific requirements, and permits acceptable products to carry a UL certification mark, as long as they remain compliant with the standards. UL offers several categories of certification. Products that are “UL Listed,” are identified by the distinctive UL mark. We have undertaken to have all of our products meet UL standards and be UL listed. There are alternatives to UL certifications but we believe that our customers and end-users prefer UL certification.

In addition to the UL certification, certain of our products must also meet industry standards, such as those set by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, and government regulations for their intended application. For example, our roadway luminaires must meet certain structural standards and must also deliver a certain amount of light in specified positions relative to the installed luminaire. 
 
Many customers and end-users also expect our products to meet the applicable ENERGY STAR requirements. ENERGY STAR is a standard for energy efficient consumer products in the United States and Canada. To qualify for ENERGY STAR certification, LED lighting products must pass a variety of tests to prove that the products have certain characteristics. We produced the first LED retrofit lamp to be successfully qualified for ENERGY STAR designation.
 
We believe our operations comply with all applicable environmental regulations within the jurisdictions in which we operate. The costs of compliance with these regulations are not material. 
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 48 employees in the United States all of whom were full-time, and two full-time employees in China. We also utilized approximately 18 temporary employees and contractors in the United States as of December 31, 2016. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
