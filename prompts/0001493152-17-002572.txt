Item 1. Business
General
 
Eco-Stim Energy Solutions, Inc. is a technology-driven, growth-oriented independent oilfield services company providing well stimulation, coiled tubing and field management services to the domestic and international upstream oil and gas industry. We are focused on reducing the ecological impact and improving the economic performance of the well stimulation process in ‘unconventional’ drilling formations. We serve major, national and independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies around the world and we offer products and services with respect to the various phases of a well’s economic life cycle. Our focus is to bring these technologies and processes to the most active shale resource basins both domestically and outside of North America using our technology to differentiate our service offerings.
 
For information about our operating segments and financial information by operating segment and geographic area, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Products and Services
 
We offer a wide variety of specialized oilfield services and equipment generally categorized by their typical use during the economic life of a well. A description of the products and services offered by each of our three services is as follows:
Pressure Pumping
 
Our customers utilize our pressure pumping services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, which restricts the natural flow of hydrocarbons. The technique of well stimulation consists of pumping a fluid into a cased well at sufficient pressure to create new channels in the rock, which can increase the extraction rates and the ultimate recovery of the hydrocarbons. Our equipment is contracted by oil and gas producers to provide this pressure-pumping service, which is referred to as a well stimulation fleet. We offer a state-of-the-art pumping fleet, including well-stimulation pumps, nitrogen pumping units and cranes, in both trailer-mounted and skid-mounted configurations. We expect to have the capability of providing a variety of pressure-pumping services, including work-over pumping, well injection, and wireline pump downs.
 
A portion of our pressure pumping equipment consists of our TPUs, which are powered by remanufactured turbine engines previously used in military applications. Each turbine engine generates approximately 4,000 horsepower and therefore when operating at 2,000 HHP, the engine is running at approximately 50% of its capacity. As a result, these turbine engines have a reputation for reliability and durability. They also weigh less than 10% of the typical reciprocating engine of comparable horsepower. The weight differential allows for better use of space on a trailer and more efficient operations. We believe the TPUs are more cost effective to operate and maintain than conventional diesel-powered equipment when run on natural gas. Prior field operations with our current TPUs have demonstrated compliance with emission standards for nitrogen oxides (“NOx”) and carbon monoxide under the EPA’s Tier 4 standards that regulate emissions from certain off-road diesel engines. Turbine engines also have significantly lower methane leakage compared to reciprocating engines.

Coiled Tubing
 
Our customers utilize our coiled tubing services to perform various functions associated with well-servicing operations and to facilitate completion of horizontal wells. Coiled tubing services involve the insertion of steel tubing into a well to convey materials and/or equipment to perform various applications as part of a new completion or the servicing of existing wells, including wellbore maintenance, nitrogen services, thru-tubing services, and formation stimulation using acid and other chemicals. Coiled tubing has become a preferred method of well completion, workover and maintenance projects due to speed, ability to handle heavy-duty jobs across a wide spectrum of pressure environments, safety and ability to perform services without having to shut-in a well. Our coiled tubing capabilities cover a wide range of applications for horizontal completion, work-over and well-maintenance projects.
Field Management
 
We recognize that energy companies are under intense pressure to increase reserves at reduced finding costs while simultaneously coming under heightened environmental scrutiny. We have taken steps to create an innovative methodology for reducing costs, improving efficiencies and increasing resource recovery rates, which incorporates geophysics, geology and geomechanical properties and various downhole diagnostics tools, including fiber optic acoustic and temperature measurements as well as downhole pressure gauges. Our suite of advanced but fully commercialized technologies can be combined to provide both highly efficient predictive models to our customers and downhole diagnostic measurements to confirm the accuracy of those predictions while providing a full suite of other information about well integrity, stimulation results, production flow properties and long term monitoring well production characteristics.
 
Our proprietary technologies are used to reduce the number of stages required to optimize production, which can result in a substantial reduction of the environmental footprint and costs of completing a well, particularly in high-cost areas. Based on many predictive models executed in several North American shale basins, we believe that the best and most productive stages often occur in brittle and naturally fracture rock formations (“micro-fracture swarms”). These micro-fracture swarms are too small to detect with 3D seismic, but their location can be inferred using a proven attribute analysis combined with core analysis and well diagnostic information. We believe that stimulation efforts in these areas tend to be more effective and frequently result in a better stimulation effort, which in turn can produce more hydrocarbons. We also have the capability to monitor the cementing and stimulation operation and the ongoing production results in real time over the life of the well, measuring the type and quantity of inflow from each stimulation stage. This data allows our customers to confirm and refine the predictability of our Geo-Predict® technology and related field services. Once the Geo-Predict® technology and our services are demonstrated to be accurate and reliable in a given area, it then offers compelling opportunities to lower production costs while simultaneously reducing the environmental impact as a result of completing fewer, better targeted stages with less horsepower and less water. In cases where the fiber optic diagnostic system is permanently installed in a well, we believe the information provided allows for proactive management of the well’s performance over the life of the well, including the ability to actively shut off zones with unwanted water flow.
 
Customers
 
Our customers consist primarily of international oil and gas exploration and production companies including national oil companies, local privately-held exploration and production companies and, on occasion, other service companies that have contractual obligations to provide well stimulation and completion services. Demand for our services depends primarily upon the capital and operating spending of oil and gas companies and the level of drilling activity in the oil and gas markets. To date, substantially all our revenue generated is attributable to a few customers, including YPF, S. A. (“YPF”) and several smaller local exploration and production companies.

Competition
 
We provide products and services in Argentina and the U.S., both highly competitive markets, with competitors comprised of both small and large companies. Our revenues and earnings can be affected by several factors, including changes in competition, fluctuations in drilling and completion activity, perceptions of future prices of oil and gas, government regulation, disruptions caused by weather and general economic conditions. We believe that the principal competitive factors are price, performance, product and service quality, safety, response time and breadth of products and services. We believe our primary competitors in Argentina include Schlumberger, Halliburton, Weatherford, Baker Hughes, Calfrac, Well Services, San Antonio International and other oilfield service companies. Domestically, we compete against many of the same competitors as in Argentina but in addition, we also face strong competition from several independent pressure pumping companies. We also compete with various other regional and local providers within each of our geographic markets for products and services.
Markets
 
Argentina 
 
We have been operating an oilfield services business in Argentina since December 2014. Our first full year of operations was 2015. The market for our services in Argentina can be broken into three service offerings, (1) Pressure pumping, (2) Coiled Tubing and (3) Field management. The majority of our revenue comes from the pressure pumping market which can be broken into three sub-markets, (1) conventional wells, (2) tight gas wells and (3) unconventional wells. Generally, the conventional wells can be serviced with 3-5 pumping units whereas the tight gas wells require 8-10 pumping units. The unconventional wells in Argentina require anywhere from 16 to 24 pumping units. In 2015, EcoStim only had sufficient pumping capacity to participate in the conventional well market. In 2016, we expanded our capacity and now have experience working in the tight gas market. We anticipate that as the market in Argentina recovers and activity increases, there will be opportunities to secure long term agreements and add additional pumping capacity to service all three markets.
 
Our Coiled Tubing business involves services to support our pressure pumping business including the drill out of frac plugs, wash-downs, chemical treatments and workover activity. We provide this service to the conventional, tight gas and unconventional well markets.
 
Our Field Management business consists of various degrees of subsurface analysis derived from the data received from clients or otherwise acquired. The different forms of data include geophysical, geo-mechanical, core samples and other information provided by our customers and data acquired, processed and interpreted by our team including real time fiber optic information data gathered from pressure gauges installed in the wells. This market is driven by exploration and step-out development in new regions or in mature areas where our customers are looking to better understand the production associated with older wells. The market for these services is limited but complements our primary business lines and brings expertise and value to our customers.
 
The drilling rig count in Argentina peaked at 113 in 2014 and bottomed at 52 in January 2017. The rig count is a reasonable indicator of activity in Argentina and the level of activity will affect the utilization and pricing of our services. Additionally, as wells become more complex and move from conventional to unconventional wells, pressure pumping demand is expected to grow.
 
Oklahoma
 
In January 2017, the Company signed a one year contract to provide pressure pumping services in north central Oklahoma. The market in this region is concentrated around wells being drilled in the Woodford, Mississippian Lime, Stack, Scoop and Springer plays. Activity in this region has accelerated in late 2016 and according to Baker Hughes’ North America Rotary Rig Count data, in March 2017 there were 101 rigs operating in Oklahoma as compared 67 rigs operating in March 2016. We have established a base of operations in Fairview, Oklahoma and expect to service all the surrounding basins going forward.
Potential Liabilities and Insurance
 
Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk and expose us to significant liabilities. An accident involving our services or equipment, or the failure of a product sold by us, could result in personal injury, loss of life, and damage to property, equipment or the environment. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as fire, explosion, or well blowout, may result in substantial claims for damages.

We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for companies of our size and with similar operations. In accordance with industry practice, however, we do not maintain insurance coverage against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. Therefore, there is a risk our insurance program may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or all losses. Currently, our insurance program includes, among other things, general liability, umbrella liability, sudden and accidental pollution, personal property, vehicle, workers’ compensation, and employer’s liability coverage. Our insurance includes various limits and deductibles or retentions, which must be met prior to or in conjunction with recovery.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our business is significantly affected by federal, state, provincial and local laws and other regulations. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things:
 

● | worker safety standards; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the protection of the environment; 
● | the handling and transportation of hazardous materials; 
● | the protection of natural and cultural resources; and 
● | the mobilization of our equipment to, and operations conducted at, our work sites. 

 
Numerous permits are required for the conduct of our business and operation of our various facilities and equipment, including our trucks and other heavy equipment. These permits can be revoked, modified or renewed by issuing authorities based on factors both within and outside our control.
 
We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings in the future. We also cannot predict whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, including changes in regulatory oversight, increase of federal, state or local taxes, increase of inspection costs, or the effect such changes may have on us, our businesses or our financial condition.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to extensive laws, regulations and treaties relating to air and water quality, generation, storage and handling of hazardous materials, and emission and discharge of materials into the environment, and the protection of natural resources. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. Historically, our expenditures in furtherance of our compliance with these laws, regulations and treaties have not been material, and we do not expect the cost of compliance to be material in the future; however, we can provide no guarantee that this will not change.
 
The primary U.S. federal environmental laws to which our operations are subject include the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and regulations thereunder, which regulate air emissions; the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and regulations thereunder, which regulate the discharge of pollutants in industrial wastewater and storm water runoff; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and regulations thereunder, which regulate the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and regulations thereunder, known more commonly as “Superfund,” which imposes liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances in the environment. We are also subject to regulation under the U.S. federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations thereunder, which regulate the protection of the safety and health of workers. Analogous state and local laws and regulations may also apply. Similar laws and regulations exist at the national and provincial level in Argentina.

Recently, there has been increased domestic and international scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities, resulting in additional regulation. Domestically, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other federal agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) have finalized rules or made proposals that would subject hydraulic fracturing to further regulation and could restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA has issued final regulations under the CAA establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and finalized CWA regulations in June 2016 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The BLM and several states have already adopted and more states are considering adopting laws and/or regulations that require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, some states and municipalities have significantly limited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so. Also in Oklahoma, where we operate in the U.S., the Oklahoma Corporation Commission has taken steps to address the potential link between hydraulic fracturing activities and underground injection disposal well operations and induced seismic events. In Argentina, Neuquén Province has promulgated rules and procedures for the exploration and development of unconventional reservoirs, while other provinces have banned hydraulic fracturing altogether. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of these proposals, any new federal, state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs for us or our customers, or delays in development or restrictions on our operations or the operations of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
In addition, from time to time regulators in both the U.S. and Argentina have taken steps to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases based on determinations by the scientific community that such emissions are contributing to climate change. Initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of cap-and-trade and/or carbon tax programs. A cap-and-trade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances. Carbon taxes could likewise affect us by being based on emissions from our equipment and could indirectly affect us by increasing operating costs for our customers. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. Severe limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and natural gas, which could decrease demand for our services and have a material adverse effect our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.
 
Raw Materials
 
We purchase various raw materials and component parts in connection with delivering our products and services. These materials are generally, but not always, available from multiple sources and may be subject to price volatility. While we generally do not experience significant long-term shortages of these materials, we have from time to time experienced temporary shortages of particular raw materials. We are always seeking ways to ensure the availability of resources, as well as manage costs of raw materials.
Seasonality
 
Seasonal weather and severe weather conditions can temporarily impair our operations by reducing our ability to operate for certain time periods, thereby reducing demand for our products and services.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2016, we had 87 employees, including 84 full-time, and 3 consultants.
 
Facilities
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 2930 W. Sam Houston Parkway North, Suite 275, Houston, Texas 77043. In addition, we own or lease additional facilities in the various areas in which we operate.

Amended and Restated Convertible Note Facility Agreement
 
On March 3, 2017, the Company also entered into an Amended and Restated Convertible Note Facility Agreement (the “A&R Note Agreement”) with Fir Tree, which became effective on March 6, 2017 and replaced the previously existing convertible notes agreement by and among the Company and ACM entities (the “Existing Note Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the A&R Note Agreement, the Company issued to Fir Tree a secured promissory note (the “Amended and Restated Convertible Note”) in a principal amount of $22 million, which replaces the Existing ACM Note, and a secured promissory note (the “New Convertible Note”, and together with the Amended and Restated Convertible Note, the “Notes”) in a principal amount of approximately $19.4 million, representing an additional $17 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes issued by the Company to Fir Tree on March 6, 2017 and approximately $2.4 million principal amount of convertible notes in payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing ACM Note. The Notes are convertible into the common stock of the Company (the “Common Stock”) at a price of $1.40 per share, contingent upon the Company receiving shareholder approval of the conversion and satisfaction of certain other conditions. The Company has agreed with Fir Tree to seek prompt shareholder approval of the conversion of the Notes. The unpaid principal amount of the Notes bears an interest rate of 20% per annum and matures on May 28, 2018.
 
The proceeds of the A&R Note Agreement will be primarily used for equipment purchases and other approved capital expenditures incurred in accordance with an approved operating budget.
 
The A&R Note Agreement also provides for certain representations, warranties and affirmative covenants and negative covenants customary for transactions of this type, including limitations on the Company’s ability to incur certain types of additional debt, engage in transactions with affiliates, sell assets, and make unapproved capital expenditures.
 
The A&R Note Agreement further provides that all obligations thereunder are and will be, subject to certain terms and exceptions, jointly and severally guaranteed by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. All obligations under the A&R Note Agreement are secured by liens on certain of the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors.
 
The A&R Note Agreement further provides for customary Events of Defaults (as such term is defined in the A&R Note Agreement), including but not limited to: failure to make payment when due, default under other agreements, breach of warranty, failure to comply with negative covenants, bankruptcy, dissolution, impairments to Material Agreements (as such term is defined in the A&R Note Agreement), lack of enforceability of the Transaction Documents (as such term is defined in the A&R Note Agreement), certain ERISA events or environmental claims or nationalization resulting in a material taking of property. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Fir Tree may declare all outstanding principal in respect of the Notes, accrued and unpaid interest thereon, premiums and other amounts outstanding under the A&R Note Agreement to be due and payable.
 
The foregoing description is a summary of the A&R Note Agreement, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the A&R Note Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
