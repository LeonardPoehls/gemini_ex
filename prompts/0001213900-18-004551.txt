ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Since 1983, Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc. (“Helios and Matheson”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) has provided high quality information technology, or IT, services and solutions including a range of technology platforms focusing on big data, business intelligence, and consumer-centric technology. More recently, to provide greater value to stockholders, the Company has sought to expand its business primarily through acquisitions that leverage its capabilities and expertise. The Company is headquartered in New York City, has an office in Miami Florida and has an office in Bangalore India. The Company's common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “HMNY”. Our website address is www.hmny.com. Information on our website is not a part of this report.
 
On November 9, 2016, we acquired Zone Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Zone”), a state-of-the-art mapping and spatial analysis company, and on December 11, 2017 we acquired a majority interest in MoviePass Inc., a Delaware corporation, whose primary product offering is MoviePass™, the nation’s premier movie theater subscription service. MoviePass Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“MoviePass Ventures”), was formed in January 2018 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. MoviePass Ventures aims to collaborate with film distributors to share in distribution fees while using the data analytics MoviePass offers for marketing and targeting services for MoviePass’ paying subscribers using the platform. In April 2018, MoviePass Ventures entered into an Acquisition Co-Financing and Distribution Agreement with Orchard Enterprises NY, Inc. for the purpose of co-funding the acquisition, advertising and promotion of MoviePass Ventures’ first film, titled “American Animals”, which premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival.
 
Zone Technologies, Inc.
 
Zone is the developer of the proprietary RedZone Map™, a GPS-driven, real-time crime and navigation map application whose goal is to enhance personal safety worldwide by providing users with real time crime data and a platform for alerting other users to criminal and other safety related occurrences in a navigation map format. Zone’s mapping lets users be pro-active when traveling, allowing them to enter a number of different cautionary items such as traffic problems, police sightings, road hazards, accidents and road closures. It also allows users to report a crime and to video upload live incidents.
 
While RedZone Map is a fully functioning app available for free in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, the Company has not yet derived any advertising or other revenues from the app.
 
Zone Spin-Off
 
In March 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a plan to spin-off Zone, our wholly-owned subsidiary. Following the spin-off, Zone would become an independent publicly traded company that we would expect to also be listed on Nasdaq. The spin-off is subject to numerous conditions, including, the effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form S-1 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), the approved listing of Zone’s common stock on Nasdaq.
 
Pursuant to the spin-off, we plan to distribute shares of Zone common stock as a dividend to persons who hold common stock of the Company as of a record date to be determined. The Company expects to set a record date to determine the stockholders entitled to receive shares of Zone in the spin-off for approximately 20 to 40 days before the effective date of the spin-off. Holders of any convertible notes and warrants of the Company outstanding as of the applicable record date may be entitled to participate in the dividend of Zone shares in the spin-off in accordance with the terms of such notes and warrants. The strategic goal of the spin-off is to create two separate companies, each of which can focus on its own strengths and operational plans and be publicly traded. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete the spin-off, and our Board of Directors may at any time decide not to proceed with the spin-off.
 
Acquisition of Majority Interest in MoviePass 
 
On August 15, 2017, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with MoviePass, which the Company and MoviePass amended on October 6, 2017 (collectively, the “MoviePass SPA”). On December 11, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of a majority interest in MoviePass (such acquisition, the “MoviePass Transaction”), pursuant to the MoviePass SPA.
 
At the closing of the MoviePass Transaction (the “MoviePass Closing”), MoviePass issued to the Company shares of its common stock representing 51.71% of its outstanding common stock in exchange for the following consideration: (1) a subordinated convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $12,000,000 (the “Helios Convertible Note”), which is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to approval by the Company’s stockholders; (2) a $5,000,000 promissory note issued to MoviePass (the “Helios Note”); and (3) the cancellation of a convertible promissory note issued by MoviePass to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $11,500,000.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 11, 2017 (the “Kelly Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, MoviePass and Christopher Kelly, a director, stockholder and noteholder of MoviePass (“Kelly”), the Company agreed to purchase from Kelly, within two business days after the MoviePass Closing, MoviePass convertible promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 (the “Kelly Notes”) for $1,000,000 in cash, which converted into shares of MoviePass Common Stock amounting to an additional 2% of the outstanding shares of MoviePass Common Stock on a post-transaction basis, pursuant to a Note Conversion Agreement entered into between the Company and MoviePass (the “Kelly Note Conversion Agreement”). 
 
On October 11, 2017, the Company and MoviePass also entered into an investment option agreement (the “Original Option Agreement”) pursuant to which MoviePass granted the Company an option to purchase additional shares of common stock of MoviePass (the “MoviePass Common Stock”) in an amount of up to $20 million (the “Original Option”). The Company exercised the Original Option in full. Upon full exercise of the Original Option, the Company owned 62.41% of the outstanding shares of MoviePass Common Stock (excluding shares underlying MoviePass options and warrants). In addition, pursuant to the Original Option Agreement, upon the MoviePass Closing, the outstanding convertible promissory notes issued by MoviePass to the Company (each a “MoviePass Option Note”) in an aggregate principal amount of $12,150,000 as of the MoviePass Closing date, including option exercises by the Company on December 5, 2017 and December 7, 2017 in an aggregate amount of $2,800,000, were cancelled in exchange for additional shares representing 8.7% of MoviePass’ common stock, plus additional cash payments to MoviePass aggregating $7,850,000.
 
Following the full exercise of the Original Option, from December 19, 2017 through February 20, 2018, the Company provided cash advances to MoviePass to support MoviePass’ working capital and operational requirements, as well as to support the expansion of MoviePass’ business plans and objectives. The total amount advanced by the Company to MoviePass during this period totaled $55,525,000 (the “Advance”).
 
On March 8, 2018, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with MoviePass (the “March 2018 Agreement”), pursuant to which, in lieu of repayment of the Advance, MoviePass agreed to sell to the Company an amount of MoviePass Common Stock equal to 18.79% of the total then outstanding MoviePass Common Stock (excluding shares underlying MoviePass options and warrants) (the “March 2018 MoviePass Purchased Shares”), based on a pre-money valuation of MoviePass of $240,000,000 as of December 31, 2017. Pursuant to the March 2018 Agreement, MoviePass also agreed to issue to the Company, in addition to the March 2018 MoviePass Purchased Shares, without payment of additional consideration by the Company, for purposes of anti-dilution, an amount of shares of MoviePass Common Stock that caused the Company’s total ownership of the outstanding shares of MoviePass Common Stock (excluding shares underlying MoviePass options and warrants), together with the March 2018 MoviePass Purchased Shares, to equal 81.2% as of March 8, 2018.
 
In addition, from March 1, 2018 through April 12, 2018, the Company advanced a total of $35,000,000 to MoviePass (the “Second Advance”). On April 16, 2018, the Company entered into an additional Subscription Agreement with MoviePass (the “April 2018 Agreement”), pursuant to which, in lieu of repayment of the Second Advance, MoviePass agreed to sell to the Company an amount of MoviePass Common Stock equal to 10.6% of the total then outstanding MoviePass Common Stock (excluding shares underlying MoviePass options and warrants) (the “April 2018 MoviePass Purchased Shares”), based on a pre-money valuation of MoviePass of $295,000,000 as of March 31, 2018. Pursuant to the April 2018 Agreement, MoviePass also agreed to issue to the Company, in addition to the April 2018 MoviePass Purchased Shares, without payment of additional consideration by the Company, for purposes of anti-dilution, an amount of shares of MoviePass Common Stock that caused the Company’s total ownership of the outstanding shares of MoviePass Common Stock (excluding shares underlying MoviePass options and warrants), together with the April 2018 MoviePass Purchased Shares, to equal 91.8% as of March 8, 2018.
 
As of the date of this report, the Company owns approximately 91.8% of MoviePass’ outstanding common stock (excluding shares underlying MoviePass options and warrants).
 
Acquisition of Moviefone Assets from Oath Inc. (a Verizon company)
 
On April 4, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Moviefone assets from Oath Inc., an entertainment service owned by Oath Inc. (formerly, AOL Inc.), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications Inc. Moviefone provides over 6 million monthly unique visitors full access to the entertainment ecosystem, from movie theaters to streaming content. The Company believes the Moviefone acquisition will help MoviePass continue to grow its subscriber base and expand its marketing and advertising platform for its studio and brand partners. The Company also believes Moviefone will allow the Company and MoviePass to provide relevant and appealing content to moviegoers while simultaneously increasing the value of the Moviefone brand.

MoviePass Business
 
MoviePass was incorporated in Delaware in 2011 and is the leading movie theater subscription service in the United States that allows members to see a new movie every day in theaters nationwide for a low fixed price. Once they sign up for the MoviePass service online, subscribers are prompted to download the MoviePass application on their smart phones and are then mailed a MoviePass debit card. Customers can also subscribe with MoviePass via the MoviePass application. The MoviePass application shows subscribers the show times of movies that are currently showing at the local movie theaters listed in the MoviePass application. The application highlights selective films designed for a specific subscriber, which prominently displays the title once a subscriber opens the application. MoviePass subscribers can use the debit card or, in select theaters, the MoviePass application, to purchase up to one movie ticket per day at any of the movie theaters listed in the MoviePass application without paying any additional costs.
 
During the four months after MoviePass’ announcement of its $9.95 per month subscription plan in August 2017, MoviePass grew to over 1,000,000 total paying subscribers including those on either its monthly or annual plans. This represents strong growth when compared to other subscription-based companies, such as Spotify, Hulu, ClassPass and Netflix, which achieved 1,000,000 subscribers in over 5, 10, 17 and 39 months, respectively, estimated based on information available publicly from various news and other sources. MoviePass surpassed 1,500,000 paying subscribers in January 2018 and 2,000,000 paying subscribers in February 2018.
 
On December 12, 2017, MoviePass and Fandor, the streaming service with the largest collection of independent films, documentaries, international features and shorts, announced that both companies partnered with Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco”) to offer a one-year subscription plan for a flat fee of $70.00 paid in advance. The subscription plan for both services was made available exclusively to Costco members for a limited time and covers a year of membership for both MoviePass and Fandor. The subscription plan was extended through February 2018.
 
In February 2018, MoviePass and Fandor launched a limited-time annual subscription plan to allow movie-goers to see a new movie in a movie theater every day for a year, and have access to the full Fandor content library for a year, for a flat fee of $105.35 paid in advance ($7.95 per month plus a one-time $19.95 processing fee less $10 of revenue share with Fandor).
 
In March 2018, MoviePass announced that, for a limited time, it would offer its annual subscription to new subscribers for $6.95 per month, paid annually and with a one-time processing fee of $6.55.
 
MoviePass is led by Theodore Farnsworth the Chairman and CEO of Helios and Matheson, Mitch Lowe, its Chief Executive Officer, Sanjay Puri, its Chief Strategy Officer, Bernadette McCabe, its Senior Vice President of Exhibitor Relations, Mike Berkley, Chief Product Officer, Khalid Itum, Vice President of Business Development and Chris Kelly, its Chairman.
 
MoviePass Ventures 
 
MoviePass Ventures was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in January 2018 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Helios and Matheson. MoviePass Ventures aims to collaborate with film distributors to share in waterfall profits and ancillary revenues while using the data analytics MoviePass offers for marketing and targeting services for MoviePass’ paying subscribers using the platform.
 
MoviePass and MoviePass Ventures Market Opportunity
 
Motion Picture Association of America Report
 
Movie going is embedded in American society and enjoyed by people of all races, ages and socio-economic levels. The 2017 Theatrical Market Statistics Report issued by the Motion Picture Association of America (the “MPAA Report”) reports that more than three quarters (76%) of the U.S./Canada population aged two or older, or 263 million people, went to a movie at the cinema at least once in 2017. According to the MPAA Report, the typical moviegoer bought 4.7 tickets per year in 2017, for a total of $1.24 billion in tickets sold in 2017. Moreover, according to the MPAA Report, 12% of the U.S./Canada population are frequent moviegoers who attend the cinema once a month or more. These individuals are responsible for 49% of all tickets sold. More than half the population are occasional moviegoers (53%), who are also responsible for 49% of all tickets. In 2017, 24% of the U.S./Canada population did not attend the cinema.
 
MoviePass intends to encourage increased attendance at movie theaters with the subscription model by targeting the occasional movie goer (those who attend less than once a month) who represent 82% of the total movie going market.
 
MoviePass’ current buying power at U.S. movie theaters represents approximately 6.1% of the U.S. box office, with MoviePass buying approximately one in every seventeen tickets in the United States. Its strong subscriber trends and potential for customer engagement drive several revenue opportunities. The value proposition to consumers to obtain low-cost access to regular theater attendance can benefit key constituents and customers of MoviePass’ business: exhibitors, studios, distributors and consumers themselves. Through its continued efforts at targeting and improving the consumer experience, MoviePass aims to maintain its strong subscriber growth and to leverage such growth with its key constituents to improve operational efficiencies, create cross-platform synergies and create multiple growing revenue streams.

Exhibitors
 
MoviePass believes it is in a unique position to benefit movie exhibitors and theaters and to address the challenges they have faced in recent years. Specifically, theater trends have pointed to stagnant sales, higher prices, lower attendance, consolidation and limited customer engagement. The trends have been driven in part by a significant increase in in-home content. With its large and growing subscriber base, MoviePass believe it is in a position to increase theater attendance, increase concession sales and drive subscribers to consume movie content in the theaters rather than at home. MoviePass’ ability to drive theater attendance can benefit theaters across the country, as MoviePass is currently available in over 91% of U.S. movie theaters.
 
Through written agreements with various exhibitors throughout the U.S., MoviePass has put together a strategy to lift theater attendance through Application Program Interface (API) integration and rigorous survey and statistical data. These arrangements with exhibitors have ranged historically from short term trial programs to formal agreements spanning more than 8 months. MoviePass’ agreements with exhibitors typically create revenue opportunities for MoviePass by (a) allowing MoviePass to purchase movie tickets directly from the exhibitor at discounts, or (b) allowing MoviePass to receive rebates from exhibitors off tickets purchased at face value. MoviePass works with the exhibitors to make up the discounted amount in MoviePass’ ticket prices by targeting its subscribers to effect concession sales from such exhibitor partners to net the cost of the exhibitor ticket discount.
 
Under the terms of its exhibitor agreements, MoviePass places exhibitor partners’ theaters as a priority within its services and API to provide top visibility for a partner exhibitor’s theater. MoviePass may also integrate an exhibitor’s loyalty program with its own API for consumption and concession spend data and for purposes of enabling MoviePass customers to earn benefits for movies they view at the selected exhibitor’s theaters. The placement and check-in from home features have been the primary drivers of MoviePass’ lift in attendance for its partner locations. The exhibitor agreements also allow for MoviePass to incorporate electronic ticketing, advanced ticketing, seat selection and show times at select exhibitor theaters. MoviePass’ arrangements with its exhibitor partners also allow subscribers to check in with exhibitor theaters from anywhere and to choose their seats, which contrasts to other theaters with which MoviePass does not maintain exhibitor agreements. In such theaters, MoviePass subscribers must be within 100 yards within location of the theater to check in.
 
MoviePass is also currently working on additional planned features in conjunction with its exhibitor partners. These include “family and friends” offerings, VIP lines, promotions and incentives for specific films which utilize surveys and other interactive engagement tools with exhibitor patrons, distribution of vendor content within the application and a “night out at the movies” program, in which MoviePass participates in revenue from its national brand partnerships. Through its “night out at the movies” program, MoviePass also believes it can create unique out-of-home experiences for its subscribers built around movie-going.  By partnering with ride-share companies, malls, local retailers and restaurants, MoviePass hopes to offer customers discounted experiences (in addition to the movie ticket) built around a night at the cinema. MoviePass aims to use its integrated application technology to connect and direct consumers to exhibitors and to drive theater attendance by creating profitable partnerships. 
 
MoviePass Ventures aims to leverage the Company’s and MoviePass’ ability to increase movie theater attendance for select films through their advanced marketing efforts and working directly with distributors to drive consumers toward select independent films and share in the economic performance of those films.
 
The Company intends to combine its data and artificial intelligence technology with MoviePass’ technology. With our big data and artificial intelligence platforms and other technologies that we own, we believe we will be able to bring a significant technological advantage to MoviePass and MoviePass Ventures.
 
Studios and Distributors 

Through its user-friendly mobile application and its targeted efforts to engage its growing list of subscribers, MoviePass has shown an ability to drive its subscribers to see movies that they would not have otherwise seen. As a result, MoviePass has been pursuing numerous opportunities with studios and independent distributors. MoviePass has closed several paid opportunities with different studios and independent distributors to promote a variety of movies from limited releases to wide release blockbusters.
 
MoviePass offers studios the ability to increase patronage of select movies by an active promotional strategy of select movie titles. In three recent examples, MoviePass was able to use its strategy of actively promoting title to (i) increase a wide distribution opening box office weekend for a film by 13.2%, (ii) increase a Thursday night preview showing for a film by 11.1% and (iii) increase a Thursday night preview showing for another film by 27.2%. Up to the date of this report, MoviePass has promoted a total of 26 films, though MoviePass does not disclose whether marketing campaigns for those films are from paid distributor engagements or whether the tests were approved by distributors or studios. MoviePass also aims to create additional revenue opportunities with studios by driving subscribers toward merchandise and products related to particular films.

MoviePass has entered into a number of revenue producing agreements with film distributors aimed at increasing attendance for specific titles. Distributors aim to leverage MoviePass’ large subscriber base by engaging MoviePass to target portions of its subscribers based on relevant subscriber information and preferences obtained through subscribers’ use of the MoviePass application. MoviePass works to increase attendance for select titles by sending its subscribers dedicated emails and push notifications for those titles at various agreed-upon times aligned with the timing of a title’s release. The targeted emails are meant to capture subscribers who reside within a certain radius of theaters where the select title is being screened. Various agreements also include additional specific data-based targeting efforts, including hyper-targeting subscribers who saw up to a certain number of comparable titles, using various creative messaging tactics via email.
 
MoviePass also conducts extensive social media marketing campaigns under its agreements with distributors. As an example of a social media marketing campaign, MoviePass may post dedicated content for a select movie title on social media on each of its branded platforms on dates mutually agreed upon with the distributor. MoviePass will then hyper-target certain subscribers who saw a number of comparable titles that have been released theatrically during a period of several months immediately prior to the release of the title in question. It will then send up to three separate hyper-targeting emails to each of those subsets of viewers. In certain circumstances, where a title in question is being released widely, MoviePass will provide these services to its entire subscriber base, while excluding agreed upon control groups.
 
MoviePass may also designate such films with premium title placement within the MoviePass application for various amounts of time. This includes the placement of MoviePass’ App Marquee, which appears on the opening screen of the application. In conjunction with opening weekend attendance, MoviePass also conducts surveys of statistically-relevant sample sizes for opening weekend attendees, after which it prepares aggregated anonymous survey results and data insights which it reports to distributors. MoviePass believes that its subscriber base is interactive and connected, resulting in the ability of MoviePass through its marketing efforts to generate valuable impressions to consumers on behalf of distributors.
 
MoviePass may also enter into revenue producing arrangements with distributors for pre-release promotional screenings. On more than one occasion, a distributor agreed to book an auditorium on behalf of MoviePass subscribers and facilitated their entrance to the screening. MoviePass then agreed to work with the distributor to create an ideal user profile so that MoviePass can specifically target and confirm audience members by viewing history for optimal marketing results. In other instances, distributors have agreed to be responsible for facilitating a MoviePass screening of a select title in certain markets and to arrange for a number of tickets to be allocated for MoviePass subscribers at special advance screenings and regional markets.
 
The agreements typically have terms of effectiveness until the select title is no longer in theaters. The distributor agreements state that MoviePass owns all rights to the data that is collected by MoviePass resulting from subscriber use of the MoviePass application, including performance and statistical data that it collects based upon subscriber attendance and behavior, surveys conducted, structured data, and visual representation of data.
 
Compensation to MoviePass for its services under distributor agreements is comprised of fixed dedicated marketing fees and/or performance-based marketing and targeting fees. MoviePass may also be entitled to receive fees, based on a certain percentage and timing of purchases relative to the title’s release, for each ticket purchased by MoviePass, which fees due to MoviePass usually include a fixed component and a variable component. MoviePass may also receive bonuses when it purchases a certain percentage of the tickets sold of a select title in the US during opening weekend.

MoviePass also conducts tests to optimize subscriber experience. MoviePass’ tests generally include testing marketing activities in various sets using in app promotion and placement, social media and targeted email campaigns and push notifications to its subscribers, and then comparing the markets where MoviePass conducted direct promotional efforts against non-promoted markets.
 
The Company also hopes to leverage MoviePass’ relationships with studios to support MoviePass Ventures. By aiming to co-acquire films or economic participation rights in films with distributors to bring films to the big screen and by driving turnout through the MoviePass app, MoviePass Ventures aims to generate increased revenue participation in the film ecosystem. The Company believes MoviePass Ventures’ theatrical releases would benefit from MoviePass’ target marketing platform and a data-driven theatrical booking strategy. MoviePass’ relationships with studios may create opportunities for MoviePass Ventures to better identify and select film opportunities for promotion and economic participation rights. MoviePass hopes that the ability to generate more content for MoviePass’ subscribers may also lead to increased subscribers, lower attrition, and expanded use by MoviePass’ customers of various MoviePass offerings.

Consumers
 
MoviePass’ core business model rests largely on its ability to continue to improve the consumer experience. MoviePass aims to do this by targeting a consumer experience that is mobile first, with features such as its “search & discovery” and “transact and enjoy” tools in the MoviePass mobile application. The movie going experience for MoviePass subscribers is a simple process, by which the subscriber first signs up for a monthly membership plan, for as low as $6.95 per month, and receives a MoviePass debit card in the mail. The subscriber then uses the MoviePass application to, sequentially, choose a movie, choose a theater, choose a show time and finally “check in.” The aim of MoviePass’ low cost and straightforward process is to create an experience for consumers to see more movies, save money, and reduce regret of the movie going experience. MoviePass believes that the simplicity of the process and the ability to engage with consumers through the various steps of the check-in process through the app creates an opportunity to drive consumers to theaters more often and for select films. It also allows MoviePass to derive data insights on interests, activities or spending.
 
MoviePass aims to further engage consumers by means of its innovative technology platform dedicated to enhancing the exploration of cinema. This includes a versatile, multi-feature application, whose current features include the ability to search movies and theaters, and purchase or redeem tickets. MoviePass also maintains a customer service platform, meant to support its growing list of subscribers and their utilization of the MoviePass application and other technology, and is continuing to work to improve the functionality and utility of this platform.
 
Vista Partnership
 
Pursuant to the terms of an API License and Services Agreement, effective as of January 16, 2017 (the “Vista Agreement”), MoviePass has partnered with Vista Group International Ltd, (“Vista”) to work together to integrate Vista’s application programming interfaces (“Vista API”) with MoviePass’ offerings, allowing for a programmatic transfer of information between MoviePass and Vista. Vista is a leading global provider of cinema management software solutions, servicing over 1,700 movie theaters, which representing over 21% of this market in the United States. The Vista Agreement allows MoviePass and Vista to: (i) share transactional information regarding movie tickets purchased by MoviePass subscribers, (ii) develop a specific protocol for onboarding exhibitors and (iii) create mutual provisions for technical support services. The Vista Agreement gives MoviePass the ability to integrate into Vista’s large customer base through the Vista API and to enable a more seamless, fully mobile experience for MoviePass’ and Vista’s customers. The Vista Agreement works to benefit theaters by means of direct integration into theater loyalty programs and to allow theaters to derive data and analytics on customer usage, location and demographics. Under the Vista Agreement, consumers are able to use e-tickets from their mobile devices, invite friends with their mobile devices and purchase food and beverage via mobile applications, all in cashless transactions. MoviePass hopes to utilize this partnership to offer premier technological advantages to its customers relative to other competitors offering movie going promotions and services.
Technology and Payment Processing
 
MoviePass is a party to card program management agreements for payment and processing services relating to the MoviePass debit card. MoviePass also historically has utilized the sale of prepaid certificates generated by third party vendors. These various arrangements relating to payment processing set forth the arrangements by which MoviePass works with a particular processor and an authorized bank to ensure front end payment on the debit card and back end settlement of the theater payment transactions. They also allocate responsibilities among the parties for handling, among other things, consumer complaints pertaining to non-acceptance payments.
Movie Theater Information
 
MoviePass obtains relevant information on movie theaters, including show times, ratings and reviews through metadata obtained through various licensed data agreements and content license agreements. These agreements set out the payment terms and relevant ownership and publication information respecting information obtained and utilized by MoviePass to include in its application and to share with its subscribers.

Competition
 
IT
 
The market for IT consulting and data analytics services is intensely competitive, affected by rapid technological advances and includes a large number of competitors. The Company's competitors include the consulting divisions of the “Big Four” accounting firms, major offshore outsourcing companies, systems consulting and implementation firms, application software development firms, management consulting firms, divisions of large hardware and software companies, and niche providers of IT and data analytics services. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than the Company. Competition imposes significant pricing pressures on the Company. The Company does not have a significant competitive presence in the IT services industry.
 
MoviePass and MoviePass Ventures
 
The market for filmed entertainment ticketing services is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. MoviePass’ potential competitors include Atom Tickets, MovieTickets.com, Fandango, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.’s AMC Stubs program, Regal Entertainment Group’s Regal Crown Club and Cinemark Holdings, Inc.’s Movie Club, as well as other potential exhibitors offering their own subscription services or loyalty programs. In addition, Sinemia Inc. offers a movie theater subscription service that functions similarly to MoviePass.
 
AMC Stubs is a loyalty program offered by AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. with approximately 10.8 million household members. Movie goers can join the loyalty program as either a basic member for free or a premiere member for $15. The basic membership offers free popcorn refills, up to a $2 discount on tickets on Tuesdays, $5 rewards for every 5,000 points (points are earned at a rate of 20 points for every $1 spent), waived online ticket fees and free popcorn on the member’s birthday. Premiere members receive a $5 discount on tickets on Tuesdays, earn 100 points for every $1 spent and all the other benefits that come with the basic membership.
 
Regal Entertainment Group also offers a loyalty program with approximately 14 million active members called the Regal Crown Club. The program only has one membership option and is free to join. Regal Crown Club members earn credits for every $1 they spend on movie tickets and at concession stands. Points can be redeemed for rewards via the use of a physical card or a virtual card with Regal’s mobile app. Rewards include free concession items, merchandise, movie tickets and more.
 
On December 5, 2017, Cinemark Holdings Inc. launched Movie Club. Movie Club is a monthly subscription plan that allows subscribers to buy one movie ticket a month for a discounted price of $8.99. Members of Movie Club can roll over unused tickets from month to month and receive a 20% discount on items bought at concession stands. Movie Club membership is only valid at Cinemark theaters.
 
Many of these competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than MoviePass does. Some of these competitors have adopted, and may continue to adopt, aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to marketing and website and systems development than MoviePass does. In addition, MoviePass’ competitors may form or extend strategic alliances with studios, exhibitors and distributors that could affect adversely MoviePass’ ability to compete on favorable terms.
 
As a new entrant into film distribution, MoviePass Ventures will have competitors with longer operating histories in the distribution of independent films, deeper ties with industry executives and film producers, and greater financial, marketing and other resources than MoviePass Ventures. MoviePass Ventures will also face competition from larger film distributors which focus on higher budget film production and distribution.

Intellectual Property Rights
 
Intellectual Property Rights Related to the Company’s Legacy Business
 
The Company relies upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect its proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom the Company licenses intellectual property, but there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the Company in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that the Company will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights. In addition, the Company is subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third- party intellectual property rights. Any such claims could require the Company to spend significant sums in litigation, pay damages, develop non-infringing intellectual property or acquire a license to the intellectual property which is the subject of the asserted infringement.

(“HMIT”), the former parent of the Company, granted us a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free right to use the name “Helios and Matheson” and related trademarks, service names and service marks. HMIT may terminate our right to use the name and related trademarks and service marks upon each of the following events: (i) we consummate a business combination or merger, pursuant to which we are not the surviving corporation, or we consummate a sale of all or substantially all of our assets without the consent or approval of HMIT or (ii) we file, or become a debtor subject to, a bankruptcy proceeding which proceeding or filing was not commenced by HMIT or consented to by HMIT.
