Item 1.    Business.
Overview
We are a global, diversified, multi-boutique asset management company with $243.0 billion of assets under management as of December 31, 2017. We currently operate our business through our seven Affiliates which we support through the provision of collaborative growth initiatives, investment capital, shared services, Global Distribution, and talent management. 
Our business model combines the investment talent, entrepreneurialism, focus and creativity of leading asset management boutiques with the resources and capabilities of a larger firm. We have a permanent partnership structure with our Affiliates that preserves the unique culture that has made each of them successful and provides them with investment and day-to-day operational autonomy. We ensure that key management professionals at each Affiliate retain meaningful levels of equity in their own businesses to maintain strong alignment of interests between us, our Affiliates, their clients, and our shareholders. Our approach to investing in Affiliates includes a profit-sharing arrangement to provide incentives for growth and prudent business management across multiple generations of Affiliate partners.
We have broad and deep experience in working with boutique asset managers, and we leverage the expertise and resources within our organization to engage actively with our Affiliates and provide them with capabilities generally unavailable to specialist asset management firms. We work with our Affiliates to identify and execute upon growth opportunities for their businesses in areas such as business line expansion and product development, as well as activities critical to the operational success of investment boutiques, including talent management, risk management and compliance support. Our Center-led Global Distribution team complements and enhances the distribution capabilities of our Affiliates. Furthermore, our collaboration with our Affiliates extends to the commitment of seed and co-investment capital to launch new products and investment capital to financially support new growth initiatives. Our business development professionals, all of whom have prior experience executing M&A transactions for asset managers, facilitate growth opportunities for both us and individual Affiliates by sourcing and structuring investments in new Affiliates as well as add-on acquisitions on behalf of existing Affiliates.

Currently, our business comprises interests in the following Affiliates: 
Our diversification, by Affiliate, asset class, geography and investment strategy, enhances relative earnings stability and provides multiple sources of growth for us. Collectively, our Affiliates offer 106 distinct, active investment strategies in U.S., global, international and emerging markets equities; U.S. fixed income; and alternative investments, including timber and secondary Funds. In addition, there is significant diversification within each of our Affiliate firms through the breadth of their respective investment capabilities. We believe our Affiliates have generated competitive absolute and relative performance records. As of December 31, 2017, the percentage of our revenue represented by assets under management, or AUM, outperforming their investment benchmarks on a one-, three-, and five-year basis was 65%, 72% and 83%, respectively. As a result, our Affiliates have, from 2012 through 2017, generated six straight years of positive annualized revenue impact of net flows, including $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 4% of beginning-of-period run rate management fee revenue, including our equity-accounted Affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our client inflows of $31.0 billion earned a blended annualized fee rate of 51.3 bps and were concentrated in higher fee rate global/non-U.S. equities and alternative assets, while our outflows and hard asset disposals of $(37.0) billion earned a blended annualized fee rate of 34.1 bps and were concentrated in lower fee rate U.S. equity and sub-advisory assets. Net flows were $(6.0) billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, representing (2.5)% of beginning-of-period AUM.

Through our Affiliates, we serve a diverse investor base in the institutional and sub-advisory channels in the U.S. and around the world. These clients are highly sophisticated, value the stability and equity ownership of our Affiliates, and typically reward our Affiliates’ strong process-driven investment performance with long-term relationships and asset flows. Our sub-advisory clients also provide access to the growing retail and defined-contribution marketplace where decision makers take a more institutional approach to choosing asset management providers. Our Affiliates currently manage assets for non-U.S. clients in approximately 30 countries, including Canada, Australia, Ireland, South Korea, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Denmark. Our Center-led Global Distribution platform, launched in 2012, has contributed to the increase of our non-U.S. assets under management. As a result of this effort, in the past five years, we have raised $14.9 billion of new client assets for our Affiliates.
Positive net revenue flows and investment performance, in conjunction with the successful execution of our business strategy, have led to growth in revenues and net income. We measure financial performance primarily through ENI, a non-GAAP measure that we believe better reflects our underlying economic performance and returns to shareholders. Our ENI revenues grew from $527.5 million in 2013 to $900.7 million in 2017, or a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, across those years of 14.3%. Over this period, our pre-tax ENI grew from $153.0 million in 2013 to $251.3 million in 2017, a CAGR of 13.2%. Our U.S. GAAP revenues excluding consolidated Funds were $519.7 million in 2013 and $885.7 million in 2017, representing a CAGR of 14.3%. Our U.S. GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to controlling interests decreased from $19.4 million in 2013 to $4.3 million in 2017. For additional information regarding economic net income, and reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Supplemental Performance Measure—Economic Net Income.”

Competitive Strengths
We believe our success as a multi-boutique asset management company is driven by the following competitive strengths:
Well-Established, Diverse Affiliates.    Through our seven current Affiliates, we are well-diversified by brand, strategy and asset class, providing multiple sources of revenue and growth opportunities for our business across global market cycles, while limiting downside risk. Each Affiliate has its own brand and investment processes and generally operates in distinct asset classes. Our assets under management across Affiliates are invested in both U.S. and global/non-U.S. equities (33.4% and 51.9%, respectively) as well as fixed income and alternative assets, including timber and secondary Funds. We are also well-diversified by investment strategy within each asset class, with 106 distinct investment strategy composites. The breadth of our investment capabilities and distinct brand identities appeal to a wide range of clients. We have a well-diversified client base with low levels of client concentration. Our business serves over 850 institutional and sub-advisory clients, with our top 25 client relationships representing approximately 28% of run rate gross management fee revenue, including our equity-accounted Affiliate, as of December 31, 2017. Total run rate gross management fee revenue reflects the sum for each account at each of our seven current Affiliates, of the product of (a) assets under management in each account at December 31, 2017, multiplied by (b) the relevant management fee rate on that account. This calculation includes all accounts at our equity-accounted Affiliate.
Differentiated Multi-Boutique Model Drives Growth.    Our business is differentiated among multi-boutique asset management firms by our focus on active engagement with our Affiliates to enhance their organic growth potential. We have a two-pronged approach for successfully collaborating with our Affiliate firms. First, we align our interests with those of our Affiliates by providing Affiliate partners with equity in their own firms and through a profit-sharing structure that sets bonuses as a percentage of pre-bonus profit. This structure gives our Affiliate partners meaningful wealth creation opportunities through equity ownership and encourages investments in long-term growth while maintaining an appropriate focus on profitability, efficient capital management and risk control. Second, we offer our Affiliates strategic and financial support to grow and enhance their businesses. Strategic guidance includes helping Affiliates to expand into new products, strategies, geographies or channels, including through lift-outs of new investment teams or the acquisition of add-on businesses, as well as seed and co-investment capital to help launch new investment strategies. In addition, our Center-led Global Distribution team complements and enhances the distribution capabilities of our Affiliates. We also help Affiliates with talent management, risk management and compliance support, as well as other shared services. Utilizing our strategic capabilities enables our Affiliates to capitalize on growth opportunities while maintaining their focus on delivering superior investment performance, innovative offerings, and excellent service to their clients. In 2017, 39% of the Company’s gross sales resulted from Center-led initiatives. 
Track Record of Competitive Investment Performance Across Market Cycles.    Our Affiliates have produced competitive long-term investment performance across their product offerings, generating outperformance relative to benchmarks across market cycles. Through December 31, 2017, 87 of our Affiliates’ 102 strategies that have performance benchmarks (such 102 benchmarked strategies represent approximately 91% of our total AUM) have outperformed their relevant benchmarks since inception. These strategies represent 96% of the total assets in the 102 strategies that have performance benchmarks. Investment performance is calculated on a gross basis, excluding the impact of management, administration, and performance fees. Based on our current average management fee rate, investment returns net of fees would be on average approximately 36 bps lower than gross returns (excluding products which are not benchmarked). Approximately 96% of benchmarked assets have outperformed their relevant benchmarks since inception. Our Affiliates’ five largest benchmarked investment strategies, Acadian Asset Management (AAM) Emerging Markets Equity, AAM Global Managed Volatility, AAM Global Equity, TSW International, and Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss (BHMS) Large Cap Value have each outperformed their relevant benchmarks since inception by 2.9%, 2.1%, 1.8%, 1.8%, and 1.2%, respectively, on an annualized basis.

Attractive Financial Model.    Our multi-boutique model generates strong, recurring free cash flow to our business that we can use for growth initiatives on behalf of existing Affiliates, investments in new Affiliates, or return to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Our ENI revenue has grown 14.3% annually since 2013 as net client cash flows generated positive annualized revenue in each year from 2013 through 2017. Our revenue consists largely of recurring management fees on assets under management and is not heavily dependent upon more volatile performance fees. We earn an attractive margin on revenue enhanced by our profit-sharing model that enables us to participate directly in margin expansion as our Affiliates grow. Our ENI operating margin (calculated before Affiliate key employee distributions) grew from 34% for 2013 to 38% in 2017 as we continued to invest in the business. Our comparable U.S. GAAP operating margin was (11)% for 2013 (18% excluding consolidated Funds) and 8% for 2017 (8% excluding consolidated Funds).
Experienced Multi-Boutique Management Team.    The members of our senior management team have significant, long-term experience in the asset management industry and bring a wide range of expertise that includes investment banking and corporate strategy, private equity, corporate development and multi-boutique business management. Each of our senior executives understands how to structure and maintain partnerships that provide Affiliate firms with the proper incentives and resources to continue to generate strong growth. Our senior executives are well known across the sector and have broad and deep relationships with high quality boutique asset managers within our target acquisition universe. The team has successfully executed on a model that has produced consistent annual growth, resulting in pre-tax ENI CAGR across the previous five years of 13.2%, while consistently producing positive revenue impact of net client cash flows.
Strong Growth Prospects from New Affiliate Partnerships.    We have established a reputation as a collaborative and supportive partner to our Affiliates and seek to partner with additional high quality managers who provide scalable institutional quality investment capabilities in asset classes in which we seek an enhanced presence. We have a strong pipeline of potential opportunities generated from our long-standing relationships across the industry, our internal prospecting activities, and our relationships with intermediaries. We have a well-defined set of criteria for executing investments in new Affiliates and believe we can enhance growth and diversify risk across our business by selectively expanding our portfolio of investment boutiques. We believe our business model is attractive to the owners of boutique asset management firms, as it provides them an opportunity to realize a portion of the value they have created, while maximizing the value of their retained equity by accelerating the growth of their businesses alongside an experienced and supportive partner. 
Growth Strategy
The cornerstone of our multi-boutique model is to combine the investment talent, entrepreneurialism, focus and creativity of leading asset management boutiques with the expertise and capital of a larger firm in areas where our resources can provide distinct advantages. We provide strategic capabilities to our Affiliates, enabling them to focus on delivering superior investment performance, innovative offerings, and excellent service to their clients. We strive to maintain and enhance the characteristics which have made our Affiliates market leaders in their areas of expertise, namely their cultures, investment processes, incentive structures and brands. Our focus is working with a select group of diverse Affiliates with whom we can build scalable business platforms leveraging their core investment and distribution capabilities.
Our growth strategy is based on the incentives inherent in our aligned partnership model. As a permanent partner dedicated to providing our Affiliates with operational autonomy, our structure is designed to align our economic interests with those of our Affiliates to promote long-term client-driven growth. Through retained Affiliate equity ownership and a profit-sharing partnership model, we ensure appropriate focus on key issues critical to the long-term success of each Affiliate, particularly investment performance, client service, talent management and risk management.

Our future growth and success will be driven by the following four core strategies:
Core Affiliate Growth.    Our growth strategy is rooted in core Affiliate growth. Our Affiliates are strong, at-scale investment management boutiques with highly-defined and rigorous investment strategies for which there is real demand in the institutional marketplace. Our Affiliates have excellent long-term performance records and have generated strong growth through net client revenue flows. See “—Overview of Current Affiliates”
Collaborative Organic Growth. Our collaboration with our Affiliates enables them to grow and enhance their businesses in ways that they could not do on their own. We leverage the broad industry experience of our senior management to evaluate, structure, and support Affiliate growth opportunities, including expansion into new products and strategies, geographies and channels. In addition, we provide seed and co-investment capital to help launch new products. See “Our Operating Model and Holding Company Activities—Collaborative Growth Initiatives”
Global Distribution.    Our Affiliates are recognized for their long-term investment performance and high quality client service, and have strong client and consultant relationships in their core institutional marketplaces. However, there are certain areas of distribution outside of their core markets that are more scale-oriented or specialized in nature. To assist our Affiliates in penetrating these markets, we offer a range of distribution capabilities in a transparent, opt-in partnership-based model that is supported by an experienced sales team focused on cultivating broad and deep relationships within the U.S. sub-advised and variable annuity channels and non-U.S. institutional markets. See “—Distribution Model and Client Base” for further discussion of our Center-led Global Distribution platform.

Investments in New Affiliates.    We will selectively pursue partnerships with additional boutique asset managers that can enhance our growth potential and diversify our earnings drivers. Our partnership strategy targets asset classes that complement our existing Affiliates’ capabilities or provide additional expertise in capacity-constrained investment strategies. Within each asset class, we seek to partner with market leaders that have track records of operating as successful, stand-alone enterprises. We target profitable and growing businesses that have the potential to build a meaningful global presence in a given asset class. Asset class attractiveness, operating scale, and depth of talent are prerequisites to partnership. However, cultural fit and a shared strategic vision ultimately provide the foundation for a successful relationship.
Successful Execution of the Growth Strategy
Since 2013, the execution of the growth strategy described above has contributed meaningfully to an increase in gross sales at the Company. On an annual basis, between 23% and 39% of gross sales can be directly tracked to Center-led activities including new initiatives, product seeding, global distribution, and sales from new Affiliates acquired by the Company. The chart below breaks out these sales contributions by category.

Our Operating Model and Holding Company Activities
Overview
We currently manage our business through seven Affiliates, each of which operates autonomously and employs its own distinct investment processes. We work with our Affiliates to identify and execute upon growth opportunities in areas such as distribution, business line expansion and product development, as well as in activities critical to the success and stability of boutique asset managers, including talent management, risk management and compliance support. Our collaboration with our Affiliates extends to the commitment of seed and co-investment capital to launch new products and investment capital to financially support new growth initiatives. We also provide focused shared service support in areas our Affiliates desire. We align incentives with our Affiliates through our permanent partnership structure, which provides employee partners of our Affiliates with equity in their respective firms through an equity recycling program, and participation in established profit-sharing arrangements.
8

Affiliate Partnership Model
We are a permanent partner dedicated to providing our Affiliates with operational autonomy in a structure that aligns our common economic interests. By offering Affiliate management direct participation in the growth and profitability of their businesses through equity ownership and a profit-share-based bonus pool, we provide our Affiliates with a strong incentive to manage their businesses for the long-term, investing with us to build equity value over time.

• | Affiliate Operating Autonomy. Affiliates retain day-to-day operating autonomy over their businesses, including decisions related to hiring, compensation, investment processes, product distribution and branding. We retain oversight through Affiliate board representation, remuneration committee participation, and certain approval rights, including approval of each Affiliate’s annual business plan. 


• | Affiliate Partners Have Retained Equity in their Own Firms. Partners in each of our Affiliates own meaningful equity positions in their respective businesses. Among our consolidated Affiliates, their equity stakes range from approximately 20% to 40%, in some cases following a distribution preference to OMAM. Affiliate equity, which in certain cases may be put back to us over time at a fixed multiple of trailing earnings, subject to limits, allows partners to benefit from long-term increases in their franchise value. We facilitate the recycling of Affiliate equity to the next generation of Affiliate partners at the same multiple so that the impact to us is generally cash-neutral. 


• | Profit-Share Economics. Rather than invest in a fixed percentage of Affiliate revenues (a “revenue-share” model), Affiliate partners and we each invest in the underlying profits of their respective businesses, a model we refer to as a “profit-share” model (with the exception of ICM, which has a revenue-share model). ICM’s revenue share model is a legacy economic arrangement that has not been restructured. Distributions of profit to the Affiliate equity-holders are based on their proportionate ownership of their businesses, in some cases following a preferred return to us. In addition, bonus pools for Affiliates are typically contractually set at 25% to 35% of Affiliate pre-bonus profit. This enables us to participate in the margin increases of our Affiliates, while incentivizing Affiliate management and us to jointly support growth initiatives. For additional information on our profit-sharing model, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—The Economics of Our Business.” 

Collaborative Growth Initiatives
Our business is differentiated from other multi-boutique asset management companies by our focus on active engagement with our Affiliates to enhance their organic growth potential. Our collaboration with Affiliates generally consists of the following:

• | Strategic Affiliate Growth Opportunities. As part of our partnership approach with Affiliates, we play an active role in working alongside Affiliates to identify and analyze potential growth strategies for their businesses. Dedicated professionals at OMAM help to formulate a plan of execution and develop an economic structure to appropriately share risk and reward between us and Affiliate equity-holders. 

We have collaborated with our Affiliates on a number of growth initiatives to further diversify and strengthen our business. Our Affiliates have been able to leverage our strategic capabilities in areas such as capital support (including seed capital and co-investments), corporate development, global distribution, product expansion, and talent acquisition and management to strengthen their franchises. Our strategic support has accelerated, and continues to accelerate, our Affiliates’ growth through a range of collaborative projects. 
Among a number of new product initiatives, in 2017 Acadian launched a Multi Asset Absolute Return strategy, which was seeded by OMAM and was the result of a collaborative organic initiative to evolve Acadian’s existing platform to include multi-asset, absolute return capabilities to address growing client demand and evolving industry trends. In 2017, we also worked with Barrow Hanley to launch a collaborative organic initiative to broaden their Fixed Income platform through the development of a leveraged loan strategy. Our support is concentrated around providing multi-year capital support for infrastructure build-outs, new seed capital investments, talent recruitment and Global Distribution support.
9

In November 2017, we further aligned our support for strategic Affiliate growth by combining our Global Distribution and Affiliate management functions. A merger of the two teams enabled closer connectivity among research, product development, capital allocation, seeding and distribution, resulting in a stronger complementary offering to our Affiliates and their clients.

• | Seed Capital. As of December 31, 2017, we have approximately $100 million committed to seed capital, which is currently invested in 20 products across six different asset classes. Our Affiliates’ use of seed capital generally falls into two categories: incubation capital and scale capital. Incubation capital is used to establish a track record for a new investment strategy. These new strategies generally take three to five years to season to the point where they are recommended by consultants or become attractive for clients. Alternatively, scale capital is used to extend a product with an established track record into a co-mingled fund, and is generally outstanding for a shorter period of time. Scale capital allows third-party clients to invest in the new fund without individually representing too substantial a percentage of the vehicle. Over $20 billion of our current AUM are in products which have been seeded by us since 2004, and our seeding program has generated an annualized internal rate of return to OMAM and OM plc of approximately 26% over this period, including investment returns on the seeded products and the incremental value generated by third party assets raised, including annual profits and a terminal value. 

In July 2017, we purchased all remaining seed capital investments owned by OM plc for $63.4 million. We financed this purchase in part through $33.5 million of borrowings under a non-recourse seed capital facility collateralized entirely by our seed capital holdings and we may borrow up to $65 million, so long as the borrowing does not represent more than 50% of the value of the eligible seed capital collateral. Since this facility is non-recourse to us beyond the seed investments themselves, drawdowns under this facility are excluded from our third party debt levels for purposes of calculating our credit ratio covenants under our revolving credit facility.

• | Co-Investment Capital. We also provide co-investment capital to support the formation of closed-end, long-term partnerships managed by our Affiliates. These fixed-life partnerships typically require us and/or the Affiliate or its employees to invest 1% to 3% of the product’s capital to align interests with those of their clients. Of our current $37.5 million portfolio of co-investments at fair value ($12.0 million of which is owed to or directly owned by OM plc), 28% is managed by Campbell Global (investing in timber) and 72% remains managed by Heitman (investing in real estate). As part of the sale of our interest in Heitman LLC to its management (see “—Overview of Current Affiliates—Sale of Heitman”), we retained our co-investment interests in Heitman-managed funds as well as any carried interest associated with these investments. In consideration for providing co-investment capital, which is typically illiquid for approximately seven to ten years, we receive returns on our underlying partnership investment, our proportionate share of profits on assets in the fund, and the potential for fund incentive fee allocations. 

10

Strategic Business Support
While each of our Affiliates operates on an autonomous basis, we seek opportunities to increase efficiency and promote the long-term stability of their respective businesses by offering strategic support. This support typically leverages our scale across the Affiliate base or provides distinctive strategic operational expertise to our Affiliates.

• | Talent Management. We are highly focused on talent management and have significant experience collaborating with Affiliates to develop talent, design incentive structures, promote continued Affiliate equity ownership and establish succession plans. A key area of focus is senior management succession planning. While this is an infrequent occurrence at each Affiliate, it represents a key point of vulnerability and opportunity that is highly scrutinized by both clients and employees. Our objectivity and experience as an external partner has been instrumental in managing through the challenges of a number of successful succession processes at our Affiliates. 


• | Risk Management and Compliance Support. Our Affiliates maintain comprehensive risk management and compliance functions, supplemented by our own, Company-based risk management and compliance teams. Our dedicated risk, legal and compliance teams work through a well-established reporting and communication structure to constantly assess risk in the context of the execution of our and our Affiliates’ business strategies. We also provide a centralized internal audit function. We view risk management as a continuous part of the management process and have created a consistent, holistic program to identify, assess, communicate and monitor risk throughout our organization. 


• | Shared Services. We offer shared services to our Affiliates in areas such as operational support, human resources, payroll and benefits administration, finance and accounting, information technology outsourcing and security, eBusiness support, and risk management systems. Affiliate participation in these services is optional; however, all of our Affiliates currently participate in one or more of our shared services. The shared services we provide generally are charged back to Affiliates on a cost-basis. 

Capital Management
Our asset management business generates significant, recurring free cash flow that can be re-invested in the growth-oriented strategies described above to create value for our shareholders. Strategic and efficient management of our Company’s capital underpins our approach to investing in these strategies. In particular, we believe we can generate strong returns on allocated capital by (i) providing seed capital to fund new products and strategies; (ii) committing co-investment capital to launch new fund partnerships in which our Affiliates act as the general partner; (iii) providing investment capital to support organic growth; (iv) investing in new Affiliates; and (v) implementing opportunistic share repurchase programs. Management undertakes detailed business case analyses with respect to all investment opportunities, and only considers those that yield an acceptable return while operating within the parameters of our risk appetite. Since January 1, 2016, we have repurchased approximately 10% of our shares, primarily as part of OM plc’s sale of its stake in our Company.
Holding Company Management Team
Our senior management team has defined a core set of operating principles and positioned our business around them. Our business strategy is to partner with market-leading, boutique investment management firms to strengthen and enhance the long-term growth of their businesses. The members of our senior management team leverage their deep experience in areas such as asset management sector investment banking, private equity and corporate strategy to focus on supporting our Affiliates in areas where we believe we can provide the greatest benefit, as well as sourcing and executing investments in new Affiliates. Our Affiliate Management team includes specialists in business and product development and strategy who work closely with Affiliates in areas such as collaborative growth initiatives, talent management and shared services. Our management team has a broad range of execution capabilities, having successfully led our Company through its initial public offering, the subsequent sell-down of ownership by OM plc via secondary offerings and the acquisition of Landmark Partners in 2016.

Overview of Current Affiliates (cont.)

Thompson, Siegel & Walmsley LLC, or TSW ($25.0 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2017), founded in 1969, applies a value-oriented investment approach across a range of products in U.S. and international equities, fixed income and alternative investments. TSW’s singular investment objective is to outperform its benchmarks, net of fees, over rolling three- to five-year periods. TSW employs a proprietary screening process to generate focused lists of companies that are most attractive within different market capitalization ranges. The firm’s investment teams then use fundamental analysis to construct portfolios, which they believe possess catalysts that can unlock value.
TSW has a diverse client base that includes corporations, public pensions, high-net-worth families and individuals, and sub-advisory clients and has generated a strong track record of providing investors with excellent long-term results. The firm’s management team is led by Chairman Lawrence Gibson, Chief Executive Officer Horace Whitworth, President Frank Reichel, Managing Director, John Reifsnider and Director of Operations, Lori Anderson. The firm has 22 investment professionals managing thirteen investment strategy composites.

Sale of Heitman
Heitman, founded in 1966, globally invests in and manages portfolios of real estate and real estate securities for its clients, which include public and corporate pension funds, endowments and foundations, and private investors. On November 17, 2017, we entered into a redemption agreement with Heitman LLC. Pursuant to the redemption agreement, Heitman agreed to redeem all of our membership interests in Heitman for cash consideration totaling $110 million. This redemption agreement was triggered by a right of first offer held by Heitman regarding a change in control of our Company. No other Affiliate has a similar right of first offer.
Heitman stopped contributing to our financial results of operations as of November 30, 2017 and the transaction closed on January 5, 2018.  Unless specifically noted, flow information includes flows from Heitman for the first half of 2017, but excludes it thereafter, and AUM data at December 31, 2017 excludes the Heitman AUM. On an after tax basis, OMAM expects to receive approximately $85.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Heitman contributed approximately 8.8% of our U.S. GAAP pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to controlling interests and 4.8% of our pre-tax economic net income (4.0% of after-tax economic net income).
Distribution Model and Client Base
Our distribution is focused on the institutional and sub-advisory channels, reached through both Affiliate-led and complementary, Center-led sales efforts. Our Affiliates have teams of established sales and client service professionals with broad and deep relationships across the major segments of the institutional investor community. Consistent with our partnership philosophy, Affiliates develop and maintain client relationships independently of both us and each other, while maintaining the option to participate in Center-led complementary distribution initiatives in the domestic sub-advisory and selected global markets. In aggregate, our Affiliates have approximately 144 sales and marketing professionals servicing over 850 institutional and sub-advisory clients.
We launched our Center-led Global Distribution platform in 2012, which consists of a team of experienced channel and regional marketing specialists focused on developing new business opportunities for our Affiliates. In the U.S., complementing and enhancing the distribution capabilities of the Affiliates, we have one executive and four sales and marketing professionals focused on cultivating relationships in the sub-advisory (mutual fund and variable annuity) channel. We also maintain independent relationships with institutional investment consultants. If requested, our team also provides strategic marketing support for the Affiliates. Outside the U.S., where scale is a meaningful advantage to support geographic reach and servicing capabilities, we have a Global Distribution team consisting of ten dedicated and strategically deployed sales and marketing professionals focused on developing client relationships and gathering assets in Canada, the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia (excluding Japan) and the Middle East. Within these channels and jurisdictions, our objective is to cultivate broad and deep relationships with key consultants and institutional investors and to generate new client opportunities for those Affiliates who take advantage of our Global Distribution platform. From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2017, we have raised $15.2 billion in client assets for our Affiliates. 
On November 29, 2017, we announced that our Global Distribution efforts will be further aligned with Affiliate Management by combining the functions. A merger of the two teams enables closer connectivity among research, product development, capital allocation, seeding and distribution and will result in a stronger complementary offering to our Affiliates and the end client. 
The institutional channel accounts for 63% of our AUM. Within this channel, we have strong relationships in the public/government pension market (29% of our AUM) and the corporate plan market (19% of our AUM), which comprise a substantial portion of the institutional investment market overall, particularly in the U.S. Our institutional marketplace clients are highly diverse across segments and geographies and have various growth characteristics.

While our Affiliates market primarily to institutional investors, we participate in the individual investor market through the sub-advisory channel, which represents 33% of our AUM. Within this channel, we manage assets for mutual funds, giving us exposure to a retail investor base and the defined contribution market. We have approximately 65 sub-advisory mandates on over 50 leading platforms, including Vanguard, American Beacon, Principal and Transamerica. Our top ten sub-advisory relationships account for approximately 28% of AUM and 15% of run rate gross management fee revenue, including our equity-accounted Affiliate, and have an average tenure of over ten years. We have experienced rapid growth in this channel, with sub-advisory assets growing over 73%, or 12% annually, from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017.
Across our Affiliates, our client base is highly diverse with no significant concentration in our portfolio, though some Affiliates may have client exposures that are meaningful to their individual businesses. As of December 31, 2017, our Affiliates’ top five client relationships represented 13% of total run rate gross management fee revenue, including our equity-accounted Affiliate, and our Affiliates’ top 25 clients represented 28% of run rate gross management fee revenue, including our equity-accounted Affiliate. During 2017, Old Mutual plc and its subsidiaries (other than us and our Affiliates) contributed less than 1% of total gross management fee revenue, including equity-accounted Affiliates.

Products and Investment Performance
Product Mix
Our Affiliates offer leading products in U.S., global, international and emerging markets equities; U.S. fixed income; and alternative investments, including timber and secondary Funds.
The charts below present our average fee rates, average assets under management, and management fee revenue excluding equity-accounted Affiliates by asset class and illustrate the diversification benefits of our multi-boutique business model. Our largest asset class, U.S. large cap value equities, represents 25.7% of our Average AUM of consolidated Affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2017; however, with a weighted average fee rate of approximately 20 basis points, this asset class represents only 13.5% of our management fee revenue in 2017. Each of five asset classes represents 13% or more of our management fee revenue in 2017, providing a balanced earnings stream to our business. Moreover, within our three largest asset classes by revenue — international equities, alternative investments and emerging markets equity — we offer a range of strategies which provide further stability to our earnings.

We have product breadth and diversity within individual Affiliates as well as across our Affiliates. For example, Barrow Hanley, whose core offerings consist of leading value-oriented U.S. equity strategies, also offers a highly-rated suite of non-U.S. equity and U.S. investment grade fixed income investment products that adhere to the firm’s traditional value discipline. Similarly, Acadian applies its quantitative approach across a range of equities, in terms of geography as well as market capitalization.

Our Affiliates’ product offerings are well-positioned in areas of investor demand, and the diversity of investment style and asset class enables us to participate in growing segments of the industry in multiple investing environments. The chart below illustrates the diversity of our assets under management by asset class and Affiliate. In total, our Affiliates manage 106 strategy composites, including three Affiliates that manage at least ten strategies each.

Investment Performance
While each of our Affiliates has distinct investment processes and generally operates in different asset classes, our unifying mission is to produce risk-adjusted performance, or alpha, for our clients. We measure alpha generation relative to the specific benchmarks our Affiliates’ clients use to evaluate our performance in our Affiliates’ strategies. Looking at this measure on a consolidated basis, our Affiliates have competitive near- and long-term performance records and are well-positioned for continued growth.
In the chart below, which measures revenue-weighted performance relative to benchmarks over the last five years, we typically have had between 50% and 90% of our revenue derived from benchmarked products (which represent approximately 91% of our total AUM) performing ahead of their respective benchmarks on a one-, three- and five-year basis. In evaluating prospective investments, we believe institutional investors generally give the three-year performance of an investment product the greatest weighting. Favorable active management results in 2017 continued to help boost performance significantly compared to the previous year period.  The one-year results increased year-over-year due to favorable active management results compared to underperformance following the Brexit vote in 2016, while the three-year period increased due to the strong returns of a domestic large cap value strategy, and the five-year period benefited from a managed volatility strategy rolling off negative returns.
Data as of December 31 for the years 2013 to 2017

In addition to analyzing our Affiliates’ performance on a revenue-weighted basis, which gives us a perspective on product performance with respect to our Affiliates’ existing client base, we also consider the number of our Affiliates’ at-scale product strategies (defined as strategies with greater than $100 million of AUM) beating benchmarks. This latter measure, labeled as “equal-weighted,” indicates the opportunity we have to generate sales in a variety of market environments. For instance, strong performance in a newer, smaller product such as small-cap emerging markets may not affect revenue-weighted performance, but it can have a meaningful effect on revenue growth given client demand for this higher fee product. The chart below indicates performance on a revenue-weighted and equal-weighted (by product) basis relative to benchmark, as at December 31, 2017. In addition, we have indicated the percentage of our assets beating their benchmarks over the same time periods. While we believe the first two methodologies provide better insight into our performance trends, we have also included AUM-weighted performance, as this is a more standard industry performance metric. 
Data as of December 31, 2017
Competition
We and our Affiliates face competition from many segments in the asset management industry. At the Company level, we compete with other acquirers of investment management firms, including investment management holding companies, insurance companies, banks and private equity firms. Our Affiliates compete globally with international and domestic investment management firms, hedge funds and other subsidiaries of financial institutions for institutional assets.
Many of the organizations our Affiliates compete with offer investment strategies similar to those offered by our firms, and these organizations may have greater financial resources and distribution capabilities than we or our Affiliates are able to offer. Additionally, there are limited barriers to entry for new investment managers. Our Affiliates compete with these organizations to attract and retain institutional clients and their assets based on the following primary factors:

• | the investment performance records of our Affiliates’ investment strategies;


• | the breadth of active investment strategies offered by our Affiliates in the asset classes in which they specialize;


• | the alignment of our Affiliates’ investment strategies to the current market conditions and investment preferences of potential clients;


• | the quality and reputation of the investment teams that execute the investment strategies at our Affiliates;


• | the strength of our Affiliates’ and our distribution teams; and


• | the strength of our Affiliates’ client service and long-term client relationships.

Business History 
The predecessor of OMAM was formed in 1980. OMAM was formed on May 29, 2014 as a private limited company under the laws of England and Wales. At the time of our initial public offering of our ordinary shares, or the Offering, we changed our name to OM Asset Management plc.
From the Offering until May 2017, we were a majority-owned subsidiary of OM Group (UK) Limited, or OMGUK, which was in turn wholly owned by OM plc. The board of directors of OM plc elected to undertake the Offering which was priced on October 8, 2014. On October 9, 2014, we began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “OMAM.”
Between the time of the Offering and November 2017, OM plc implemented a plan to dispose of our shares in an orderly manner which balanced value, cost, time and risk. A series of transactions were executed to dispose of OM plc’s shareholdings, including secondary offerings on the public market, sales of shares from OM plc to HNA Capital U.S., or HNA, and our repurchase and retirement of shares held by OM plc. Following these transactions, at December 31, 2017, HNA owned 24.95% of our outstanding ordinary shares and OM plc held 1,000 of our ordinary shares. See Note 1, “Organization and Description of the Business” in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein for a further description of these transactions.
In August 2016, we completed the acquisition of Landmark Partners and in November 2017 we agreed to sell our stake in Heitman LLC to members of Heitman’s management, a transaction that was completed in January 2018.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,342 full-time equivalent employees, of which 88 were employees of the Company and 1,254 were employees of our Affiliates. None of our employees or those of our Affiliates are subject to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions to operations due to labor disagreements.
Operations, Systems and Technology
We generally use both third-party commercial technology solutions and services to support investment management and operational activities, including functions such as portfolio management, trading, investment accounting, client reporting and financial reporting. Certain Affiliates have built proprietary systems to support the investment process where competitive advantages to do so exist. Systems and processes are customized as necessary to support our investment processes and operations. Information security, business continuity and data privacy programs have been implemented to help mitigate risks.
