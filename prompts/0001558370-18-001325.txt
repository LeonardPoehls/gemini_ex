     ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
     COMPANY OVERVIEW
     Depomed is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on pain and other central nervous system (CNS) conditions. Our current specialty pharmaceutical business includes the following three products which we market in the United States (U.S.):
· | Gralise® (gabapentin), a once‑daily product for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), that we launched in October 2011.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | CAMBIA® (diclofenac potassium for oral solution), a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug for the acute treatment of migraine attacks, that we acquired in December 2013.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Zipsor® (diclofenac potassium) liquid filled capsules, a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug for the treatment of mild to moderate acute pain, that we acquired in June 2012.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In January 2018, pursuant to the terms of a Commercialization Agreement we entered into with Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Collegium) in December 2017, we granted Collegium the right to commercialize the NUCYNTA® franchise of pain products in the U.S. Pursuant to the Commercialization Agreement, Collegium assumed all commercialization responsibilities for the NUCYNTA franchise effective January 9, 2018, including sales and marketing. We will receive a royalty on all NUCYNTA revenues based on certain net sales thresholds, with a minimum royalty of $135.0 million per year during the first four years of the agreement, subject to certain conditions.  Additionally, we retained certain rights to co-promote NUCYNTA products, subject to providing advanced notice to Collegium. The NUCYNTA franchise includes two products currently marketed in the U.S. by Collegium:
    
· | NUCYNTA® ER (tapentadol extended release tablets), a product for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around‑the‑clock, long term opioid treatment, including neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in adults, and for which alternate treatment options are inadequate; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NUCYNTA® IR (NUCYNTA) (tapentadol), an immediate release version of tapentadol for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in adults.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In November 2017, we entered into definitive agreements with Slán Medicinal Holdings Limited and certain of its affiliates (Slán) pursuant to which we acquired Slán’s rights to market the specialty drug cosyntropin (Synthetic ACTH Depot) in the U.S., and Slán acquired our rights to Lazanda® (fentanyl) nasal spray. We believe cosyntropin can be second-to-market behind Mallinckrodt plc's marketed product, H-P Acthar gel. We expect Slán to file a New Drug Application (NDA) for cosyntropin in late 2018 with a goal of a potential launch in the second half of 2019 or early 2020, if the product is approved.
     We actively seek to expand our product portfolio through acquiring or in‑licensing commercially available products or late‑stage product candidates that may be marketed and sold effectively through our sales and marketing capability.
     We also have royalty and milestone producing license arrangements based on our proprietary Acuform® gastroretentive drug delivery technology, including with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ironwood).

 Strategy
     Our commercial strategy is based on three pillars:  Maintain, Grow and Build.  
     We intend to “Maintain” our NUCYNTA franchise of pain products through our commercialization arrangement with Collegium. In January 2018, pursuant to the terms of a Commercialization Agreement we entered into with Collegium in December 2017, we granted Collegium the right to commercialize the NUCYNTA franchise of pain products in the U.S.  Pursuant to the Commercialization Agreement, Collegium assumed all commercialization responsibilities for the NUCYNTA franchise effective January 9, 2018, including sales and marketing. We will receive a royalty on all NUCYNTA revenues based on certain net sales thresholds, with a minimum royalty of $135.0 million per year during the first four years of the agreement, subject to certain conditions. Both we and Collegium may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances. We can terminate the agreement if aggregate net sales of the NUCYNTA products fall below certain thresholds or within the first year upon the payment of a termination fee. Collegium may terminate at any time after the first anniversary of the transaction by giving 12 months’ notice and, if the termination date is prior to the fourth anniversary of the transaction, by paying us a $25.0 million termination fee.
     We intend to “Grow” our neurology and non-opioid pain franchises, through organic and inorganic growth. As of September 2017, we increased the size of our neurology field force to 90 representatives and, in doing so, doubled our call plan targets. We believe our increased field force supports Gralise, Cambia and Zipsor, three promotionally sensitive products, and allows us the flexibility to add new neurology products.
     We intend to “Build” a portfolio of high-value products positioned to address the needs of patients, physicians and payers.  In November 2017 we acquired the exclusive rights to market cosyntropin in the U.S.  We will seek to bring additional specialty products into this portfolio. 
     In connection with our entry into the Commercialization Agreement with Collegium, we eliminated our pain sales force and announced our intent to relocate our headquarters and reduce our headquarters’ staff.  Excluding restructuring charges we expect these actions will significantly reduce our operating expenses in future periods, further enabling us to implement our strategy.
     OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS
     As of December 31, 2017, our revenues were generated primarily from the following commercialized products.
     Gralise (Gabapentin)
     Gralise is our proprietary, once‑daily formulation of gabapentin indicated for management of PHN, a persistent pain condition caused by nerve damage during a shingles, or herpes zoster, viral infection. We made Gralise commercially available in October 2011, following its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in January 2011. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug exclusivity for PHN. Gralise product sales were $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $88.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.     CAMBIA (Diclofenac Potassium for Oral Solution)
     CAMBIA is a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug (NSAID) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 18 years of age or older. We acquired CAMBIA in December 2013 from Nautilus Neurosciences, Inc. (Nautilus).
     We began shipping and recognizing product sales on CAMBIA in December 2013. Our CAMBIA product sales were $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

 Zipsor (Diclofenac Potassium) Liquid‑Filled Capsules
     Zipsor is an NSAID indicated for relief of mild to moderate acute pain in adults. Zipsor uses proprietary ProSorb® delivery technology to deliver a finely dispersed, rapidly absorbed formulation of diclofenac. We acquired Zipsor on June 21, 2012 from Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Xanodyne).
     Our Zipsor® product sales were $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
     NUCYNTA ER (Tapentadol Extended Release Tablets)
     NUCYNTA ER is an extended release version of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around‑the‑clock, long term opioid treatment, including neuropathic pain associated with DPN in adults, and for which alternate treatment options are inadequate. We acquired the U.S. rights to NUCYNTA ER from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen Pharma) and began shipping and recognizing product sales on NUCYNTA ER in April 2015. We began commercial promotion of NUCYNTA ER in June 2015.
     NUCYNTA (Tapentadol)
     NUCYNTA is an immediate release version of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in adults. We acquired the U.S. rights to NUCYNTA from Janssen Pharma and began shipping and recognizing product sales on NUCYNTA in April 2015. We began commercial promotion of NUCYNTA in June 2015. 
     NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA product sales were $239.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $281.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $189.9 million for the period from April 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2015.
     In January 2018, pursuant to the terms of a Commercialization Agreement we entered into with Collegium in December 2017, we granted Collegium the right to commercialize the NUCYNTA franchise of pain products in the U.S.  Pursuant to the Commercialization Agreement, Collegium assumed all commercialization responsibilities for the NUCYNTA franchise effective January 9, 2018, including sales and marketing. We will receive a royalty on all NUCYNTA revenues based on certain net sales thresholds, with a minimum royalty of $135.0 million per year during the first four years of the agreement, subject to certain conditions. Both we and Collegium may terminate the agreement under certain circumstances. We may terminate the agreement if aggregate net sales of the NUCYNTA products fall below certain thresholds or within the first year upon the payment of a termination fee. Collegium may terminate at any time after the first anniversary of the transaction by giving 12 months’ notice and, if the termination date is prior to fourth anniversary of the transaction, by paying us a $25.0 million termination fee.
     Lazanda (Fentanyl) Nasal Spray
     Lazanda nasal spray is an intranasal fentanyl drug used to manage breakthrough pain in adults (18 years of age and older) who are already routinely taking other opioid pain medicines around‑the‑clock for cancer pain. We acquired Lazanda in July 2013 from Archimedes Pharma US Inc. and its affiliated companies (collectively, Archimedes). Our Lazanda product sales were $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
     In November 2017, we entered into agreements with Slán pursuant to which Slán acquired our rights to Lazanda.
     Product Candidates
     In November 2017, we entered into agreements with Slán pursuant to which we obtained the marketing rights to cosyntropin. We believe cosyntropin can be second-to-market behind Mallinckrodt plc's marketed product, H-P Acthar gel. We expect Slán to file an NDA for cosyntropin in late 2018 with a goal of a potential launch in second half of 2019 or early 2020, if the product is approved.

 In December 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Grunenthal GmbH (Grunenthal) pursuant to which we acquired the U.S. and Canadian rights to cebranopadol, a product candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic nociceptive and neuropathic pain.  In January 2018, we gave to Grunenthal 120 days’ written notice of termination of the cebranopadol license agreement.
     Segment and Customer Information
     We operate in one operating segment and have operations solely in the United States. To date, substantially all of our revenues from product sales are related to sales in the United States.
     The three large, national wholesale distributors represent the vast majority of our business and represented the following percentages of product shipments and accounts receivable for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
    
 | Product shipments | Product sales-related accounts receivable
 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015
McKesson Corporation | 36% | 36% | 36% | 41% | 39% | 38% 
AmerisourceBergin Corporation | 27% | 27% | 24% | 27% | 33% | 25% 
Cardinal Health | 26% | 25% | 27% | 23% | 20% | 25% 
All others | 11% | 12% | 13% | 9% | 8% | 12% 
Total | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100%

          Collaboration and License Agreement with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
     In July 2011, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ironwood granting Ironwood a license for worldwide rights to certain patents and other intellectual property rights to our Acuform drug delivery technology for IW‑3718, an Ironwood product candidate under evaluation for refractory GERD. We have received $3.4 million under the agreement, including a contingent milestone payment of $1.0 million in March 2014 as a result of the initiation of clinical trials relating to IW‑3718 by Ironwood. We will receive additional contingent milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain development milestones and royalties on net sales of the product if approved, including a $5.0 million contingent milestone payment if Ironwood commences Phase 3 clinical trials for IW-3718.     RESTRUCTURING
     In June 2017, we announced a reduction-in-force in order to streamline operations and achieve operating efficiencies. In December 2017, we continued our restructuring plans by initiating a company-wide restructuring designed to help position the Company for sustainable, long-term growth that we believe will align our staff and office locations to fit our commercial strategy. In February 2018, we eliminated our pain sales force, consisting of approximately 230 sales representative and 25 manager positions, and announced plans to relocate our corporate headquarters from Newark, California to Lake Forest, Illinois sometime in mid-2018. In connection with this relocation, we will significantly reduce our office staff and reduce our headquarters office space by approximately 50%.  See note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information about our restructuring.

 MARKETING AND SALES
     We have developed capabilities in various aspects relating to the commercialization of our marketed products, including sales, marketing, manufacturing, quality assurance, wholesale distribution, managed market contracting, government price reporting, medical affairs, compliance, and regulatory. Members of our commercial organization are also engaged in the commercial and marketing assessments of other potential product candidates.
     Our neurology sales organization includes approximately 90 full time sales representatives, approximately 40 of whom are Depomed employees and the balance of whom are employees of a contract sales organization. Our neurology sales force primarily calls on neurologists, pain specialists and primary care physicians throughout most of the United States. Our marketing organization is comprised of professionals who have developed a variety of marketing techniques and programs to promote our products, including promotional materials, speaker programs, industry publications, advertising and other media.
     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
     Our research and development expenses were $13.7 million in 2017, $32.6 million in 2016 and $17.5 million in 2015. We expect research and development expenses in 2018 to approximate, or slightly decrease from, 2017 levels. Research and development expenses in 2018 will consist primarily of pediatric studies relating to NUCYNTA, Cambia and Zipsor.      MANUFACTURING
     Our facility is used for office purposes. No commercial manufacturing or research and development work takes place at our facility.
     We are responsible for the supply and distribution of our marketed products. We have manufacturing and supply agreements with sole commercial suppliers for each of our marketed products, as follows: for NUCYTNA ER, with an affiliate of Janssen Pharma; for NUCYNTA, with Halo Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Halo); for Gralise, with Patheon Puerto Rico Inc. (Patheon); for CAMBIA, with MiPharm, S.p.A. (MiPharm); for Lazanda, with Renaissance Lakewood, Inc. (Renaissance); and for Zipsor, with Catalent Ontario Limited (Catalent).
     We have one qualified supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in each of marketed products, and have supply agreements with the suppliers of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in each of our marketed products. We also obtain polyethylene oxide, one of the excipients common to Gralise and products under development by our partners, on a purchase order basis from Dow Chemical, our sole source for polyethylene oxide. We currently have no long term supply arrangement with respect to polyethylene oxide.
     Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused significant devastation and damage throughout Puerto Rico in 2017, including widespread flooding and power loss. As a result, we experienced delays in the manufacture, packaging and delivery of certain dosage strengths of NUCYNTA ER in fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. We and Collegium may continue to experience further outages in the future. Any delay in the manufacture, packaging or delivery of NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER, whether due to the manufacturing facility at which NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER not being fully operational for an extended period of time or otherwise, could adversely affect the ability of Collegium to commercialize such products, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

 *(1) Subject to six‑month pediatric patent term extension beyond scheduled expiration date.
  (2)  Patent rights are exclusively in‑licensed by us.
     Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technologies. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights, by among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology. In addition to those patents noted on the above table, we have 11 patent applications pending in the U.S. Our pending patent applications may lack priority over other applications or may not result in the issuance of patents. Even if issued, our patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide protection against competitors with similar technologies and may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or may not provide us with competitive advantages against competing products. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how, which are difficult to protect. We seek to protect such information, in part, through entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborative partners and others before such persons or entities have access to our proprietary trade secrets and know how. These confidentiality agreements may not be effective in certain cases. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. 
     Our ability to develop our technologies and to make commercial sales of products using our technologies also depends on not infringing other patents or intellectual property rights. We are not aware of any intellectual property claims against us. However, the pharmaceutical industry has experienced extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. For instance, in February 2018, Purdue Pharma sued Collegium for infringement of three patents owned by Purdue that were issued in January 2018 and expire in 2022 arising from Collegium’s commercialization of the Nucynta franchise of products. Although we are not a defendant in the suit, Purdue has identified Depomed as an infringer of the patents due to our manufacture of the products. If claims concerning any of our products were to arise and it is determined that these products infringe a third party’s proprietary rights, we could be 

 
  10

 
subject to substantial damages for past infringement or be forced to stop or delay our activities with respect to any infringing product, unless we can obtain a license, or we may have to redesign our product so that it does not infringe upon such third party’s patent rights, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds or time. Such a license may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we, our collaborators or our licensors were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property.
     From time to time, we may become aware of activities by third parties that may infringe our patents. We may need to engage in litigation to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third‑party proprietary rights, such as litigation described in “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS”. Our issued or licensed patents may not be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. Whether or not the outcome of litigation is favorable to us, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns. Adverse determinations in litigation or interference proceedings could require us to seek licenses which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. If we need but cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from marketing the affected product.
     COMPETITION
     General. We believe that we compete favorably in our markets on the basis of the safety and efficacy of our products. However, competition in pharmaceutical products is intense, and we expect competition to increase. There may be other companies developing products competitive with ours of which we are unaware. Many of our principal competitors have greater financial, sales, marketing, personnel and research and development resources than we do. Competing products developed in the future may prove superior to our products, either generally or in particular market segments. These developments could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete.
     Gralise for Postherpetic Neuralgia. Gabapentin is currently sold by Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) as Neurontin® and by several generic manufacturers for adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures and for the management of PHN (postherpetic neuralgia). In addition, Pfizer’s product Lyrica® (pregabalin) has been approved for marketing in the United States for the management of PHN, neuropathic pain associated with DPN (diabetic peripheral neuropathy), neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury, fibromyalgia, and adjunctive therapy in partial onset seizures. In January 2018, Pfizer began to sell Lyrica® CR a controlled release formulation of Lyrica® for neuropathic pain associated with DPN and for PHN. Gralise competes against these products and other neuropathic pain treatments, such as anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, local anesthetics used as regional nerve blockers, anti-arrhythmics and opioids. Arbor Pharmaceutical, LLC.’s HorizantTM (gabapentin enacarbil extended-release tablets) product, a prodrug of gabapentin, is also marketed for the management of PHN in the U.S. as well as for Restless Leg Syndrome.
     CAMBIA for the Acute Treatment of Migraine Attacks. Diclofenac, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in CAMBIA, is a NSAID approved in the United States for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. CAMBIA competes with a number of triptans which are used to treat acute migraine and certain other headaches. Currently, seven triptans are available generically and sold in the United States (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan). Branded competitors include Zomig® Nasal Spray, Onzetra® Xsail®, Sumavel, ZembraceTM SymTouchTM and Treximet®, which is a fixed dose combination product containing sumatriptan and naproxen. Pernix plans to launch its Treximet generic in Q1 2018, ahead of its patent expiration. There are other products prescribed for or under development for the treatment of migraines which are now or may become competitive with CAMBIA, including a new class of anti-CGRP products which is expected to launch in 2018.
     Zipsor for Mild to Moderate Acute Pain. Diclofenac, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Zipsor, is a NSAID that is approved in the United States for relief of mild to moderate acute pain. Both branded and generic versions of diclofenac are marketed in the United States. Zipsor competes against other drugs that are widely used to treat mild to moderate acute pain. In addition, a number of other companies are developing NSAIDs in a variety of dosage forms for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and related indications. Other drugs are in clinical development to treat acute pain.
     NUCYNTA ER (tapentadol extended release tablets). NUCYNTA ER competes against other long‑acting opioid medications. Those include, among others: OxyContin® (oxycodone hydrochloride extended‑release tablets); Butrans® (buprenorphine); BelbucaTM (buprenorphine buccal film); Hysingla® ER (hydrocodone bitartrate); Xtampza® ER (oxycodone); Zohydro® ER (hydrocodone bitartrate); Embeda® (morphine sulfate and naltrexone hcl); Arymo® ER 

 
  11

 
(morphine sulfate); MorphaBondTM ER (morphine sulfate); and numerous generically available long‑acting opioids. New products continue to be developed and approved, including those approved but not yet launched: Pfizer’s Troxyca, Teva’s Vantrela and Daiichi-Sankyo’s RoxyBond. 
     NUCYNTA (tapentadol). NUCYNTA (tapentadol) competes primarily against other short‑acting opioids. There are numerous such medicines, including, among others: Oxaydo® (oxycodone hcl); generic oxycodone hcl; generic oxycodone acetaminophen; generic oxymorphone; generic hydrocodone acetaminophen; generic hydromorphone; generic morphine; generic tramadol hcl and generic tramadol acetaminophen. New short-acting opioids continue to be developed and approved. 
     GOVERNMENT REGULATION
     Product Development
     Numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries regulate our research and development activities and those of our collaborative partners. Governmental approval is required of all potential pharmaceutical products prior to the commercial use of those products. The regulatory process takes several years and requires substantial funds. If cosyntropin does not receive regulatory approval or if such an approval is delayed, our business could be materially adversely affected. We cannot be certain that the requisite regulatory approvals will be obtained without lengthy delays, if at all.
     In the U.S., the FDA rigorously regulates pharmaceutical products. If a company fails to comply with applicable requirements, the FDA or the courts may impose sanctions. These sanctions may include civil penalties, criminal prosecution of the company or its officers and employees, injunctions, product seizure or detention, product recalls, and total or partial suspension of production. The FDA may withdraw approved applications or refuse to approve pending new drug applications, premarket approval applications, or supplements to approved applications.
     We may be required to conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings. These studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product. If preclinical testing is required, we must submit the results of the studies to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug Application, which must become effective before beginning clinical testing in humans.
     Some of the products we have developed have been submitted for approval under Section 505(b) (2) of the FDCA which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch‑Waxman Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of a NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. For instance, the NDA for Gralise relies on the FDA’s prior approval of Neurontin® (gabapentin), the immediate release formulation of gabapentin initially approved by the FDA.
     Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time‑consuming and costly three‑phase process:
    
· | In Phase 1, we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug’s early safety profile and its pharmacokinetic pattern.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In Phase 2, we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and further evidence of safety.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In Phase 3, we conduct large‑scale, multi‑center, comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product candidate, as required by the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The FDA closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing. The FDA may, at its discretion, re‑evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to patients. The FDA may also require additional clinical trials after approvals, which are known as Phase 4 trials.
     The results of preclinical and clinical testing are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, for approval prior to commercialization. An NDA requires that our products are compliant with current good manufacturing practices or cGMP. Failure to achieve or maintain cGMP standards for our products would adversely impact their marketability.

In responding to an NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application.
     Foreign regulatory approval of a product must also be obtained prior to marketing the product internationally. Foreign approval procedures vary from country to country. The time required for approval may delay or prevent marketing in certain countries. In certain instances we or our collaborative partners may seek approval to market and sell certain products outside of the United States before submitting an application for United States approval to the FDA. The clinical testing requirements and the time required to obtain foreign regulatory approvals may differ from that required for FDA approval. Although there is now a centralized European Union (EU) approval mechanism in place, each EU country may nonetheless impose its own procedures and requirements. Many of these procedures and requirements are time‑consuming and expensive. Some EU countries require price approval as part of the regulatory process. These constraints can cause substantial delays in obtaining required approval from both the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed, and approval in any single country may not meaningfully indicate that another country will approve the product.
     Reimbursement
     Sales of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. depend in significant part on the extent of coverage and reimbursement from government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as other third party payers. Third party payers are undertaking significant efforts to control the cost of pharmaceutical products, including by implementing cost containment measures to control, restrict access to, or influence the purchase of drugs, and other health care products and services.
     Government programs may regulate reimbursement, pricing, and coverage of products in order to control costs or to affect levels of use of certain products. Private health insurance plans may exclude or restrict coverage of some products, such as by using payer formularies under which only selected drugs are covered, variable co‑payments that make drugs that are not preferred by the payer more expensive for patients, and by employing utilization management controls, such as requirements for prior authorization or prior failure on another type of treatment.
     Fraud and Abuse
     Pharmaceutical companies that participate in federal healthcare programs are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti‑kickback and false claims laws. Violations of U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).
     Federal statutes that apply to us include the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration in exchange for or to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a drug, that is reimbursable by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the Federal False Claims Act (FCA), which generally prohibits knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to the federal government any false, fraudulent or medically unnecessary claims for reimbursed drugs or services. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have asserted liability under the FCA for claims submitted involving inadequate care, kickbacks, improper promotion of off‑label uses and misreporting of drug prices to federal agencies.
     Similar state laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non‑governmental payers, including private insurers. These state laws may be broader in scope than their federal analogues, such as state false claims laws that apply where a claim is submitted to any third‑party payer, regardless of whether the payer is a private health insurer or a government healthcare program, and state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to certify compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines.
     Federal and state authorities have increased enforcement of fraud and abuse laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the law and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the FCA and under state and local laws. These laws are broad in scope and there may not be regulations, guidance, or court decisions that definitively interpret these laws and apply them to particular industry practices. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.

     Prescription Limitations
     Many states, including the Commonwealths of Massachusetts  and Virginia and the States of New York, Ohio, Arizona, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rode Island, Colorado, Wisconsin, Alabama, South Carolina, Washington and New Jersey, have either recently enacted, intend to enact, or have pending legislation or regulations designed to, among other things, limit the duration and quantity of initial prescriptions of immediate release form of opiates (such as NUCYNTA), mandate the use by prescribers of prescription drug databases and mandate prescriber education.  These and other state and local laws applicable to the pharmaceutical industry may affect our business and operations as well as those of our commercialization and development partners.     Controlled Substances
     The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is the federal agency responsible for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA).  The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. Except for research and industrial purposes, a pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances.  Tapentadol, the active ingredient in NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER, is listed by the DEA as a Schedule II substance under the CSA. Consequently, its manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation.
     Registration with the DEA is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports a controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized to be handled under that registration.
     The availability and production of all Schedule II substances, including tapentadol, is limited by the DEA through a quota system that includes a national aggregate quota, production quotas for individual manufacturers and procurement quotas that authorize the procurement of specific quantities of Schedule II controlled substances for use in drug product manufacturing. The DEA annually establishes an aggregate quota for total tapentadol production in the U.S. based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet commercial and scientific need. The aggregate quota of tapentadol that the DEA allows to be produced in the U.S. is allocated among applicable individual drug manufacturers, which must submit applications at least annually to the DEA for individual production quotas. In turn, the manufacturers of NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER, which are third-party contract manufacturers, have to obtain a procurement quota to source tapentadol for the production of NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER.
     The DEA requires substantial evidence and documentation of expected legitimate medical and scientific needs before assigning quotas for these activities. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. The DEA may also require drug manufactures to submit applications for individual production quota on a rolling basis. 
     Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we, as well as our third-party Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) suppliers and manufacturers, are subject to such regulation by several states with respect to the manufacture and distribution of these products.
     Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
     The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) contains provisions that have or could potentially impact our business, including (a) an increase in the minimum Medicaid rebate to states participating in the Medicaid program on branded prescription drugs; (b) the extension of the Medicaid rebate to managed care organizations that dispense drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries; and (c) the expansion of the 340B Public Health Service Act drug pricing program (340B Program), which provides outpatient drugs at reduced rates, to include certain children’s hospitals, free standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers.

     Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the Sunshine Act) provisions, enacted in 2010 as part of ACA, require pharmaceutical manufacturers, among others, to disclose annually to the federal government (for re‑disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures and impose penalties for failures to disclose. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. As a result of the ambiguity in certain of these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.
     Our operations and business are subject to a number of other laws and regulations, including those relating to the workplace, privacy, laboratory practices and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances as well as controlled substances. In addition, state laws may also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances and may contain different or broader privacy protections than the federal provisions.
     EMPLOYEES
     As of December 31, 2017, we had 434 full‑time employees. In connection with our Commercialization Agreement with Collegium, we terminated our pain sales force of approximately 230 sales representative and 25 manager positions and began reducing our headquarters-based employees, which reduction is expected to be substantially completed by mid-2018.  As of February 15, 2018, we had 170 full-time equivalent employees. 
     We plan to relocate our corporate headquarters from Newark, California to Lake Forest, Illinois sometime in mid-2018. In connection with this relocation, we will significantly reduce our office staff and reduce our headquarters office space by approximately 50%. See note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information about our restructuring.
     None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our retained employees are good.
     Biographical information regarding our executive officers is contained in Part III, Item 10 and is incorporated herein by reference.
