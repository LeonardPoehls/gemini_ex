     See “—Segments and Sources of Revenue” below and “Segment Information” in the notes to the financial statements for information regarding revenues and total assets for each business segment.
     History and Organizational Structure
     General
     The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 2004. Originally incorporated in Hawaii in 1883 as Mutual Telephone Company, our Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. subsidiary has a strong heritage of over 133 years as Hawaii’s communications carrier. From 1967 to May 1, 2005, we operated as a division of Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) or its predecessors. On May 2, 2005, the Verizon businesses conducted in Hawaii were reorganized and consolidated (2005 Reorganization) into Hawaiian Telcom Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the 2005 Reorganization, we became a stand-alone provider of communications services, operating as Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. and Hawaiian Telcom Services Company, Inc., both wholly owned subsidiaries of Hawaiian Telcom Communications, Inc.
     On December 1, 2008, the Company, Hawaiian Telcom Communications, Inc., Hawaiian Telcom, Inc., Hawaiian Telcom Services Company, Inc. and certain other affiliates (collectively, the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in order to facilitate a balance sheet restructuring. The Debtors’ chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization became effective, and the Company and other Debtors emerged from chapter 11, on October 28, 2010.
     Hawaiian Telcom, Inc., a Hawaii corporation, is the incumbent local exchange carrier (“ILEC”) in Hawaii and operates our regulated local exchange carrier business. Hawaiian Telcom Services Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation, operates other businesses including Internet, television, advanced communications and network services, managed services, data center services including colocation and virtual private cloud, cloud‑based services, long distance and wireless businesses. SystemMetrics Corporation, a wholly‑owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Telcom Services Company, Inc. and a Hawaii corporation, provides data center services including colocation and virtual private cloud. Wavecom Solutions Corporation, a wholly‑owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. and a Hawaii corporation, provides voice, data and converged services.

 Industry Overview
     The telecommunications industry is comprised of companies involved in the transmission of voice, data and video communications over various media and through various technologies. There are two predominant types of local telephone service providers, or carriers, in the telecommunications industry: incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) and competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). An ILEC refers to the regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs), which were the local telephone companies created from the breakup of AT&T in 1984, as well as small and midsize independent telephone companies, such as Hawaiian Telcom, Inc., Cincinnati Bell Inc. and Consolidated Communications, Inc., which sell local telephone service. These ILECs were the traditional monopoly providers of local telephone service prior to the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In contrast, a CLEC is a competitor to local telephone companies that has been granted permission by a state regulatory commission to offer local telephone service in an area already served by an ILEC.
     Over the last decade, the U.S. telecommunications industry has undergone significant structural changes as many of the largest service providers have achieved growth through acquisitions and mergers, while others have restructured or entered bankruptcy to obtain protection from creditors. In addition, the Telecommunications industry continues to see changes in consumer behavior as products and services continue to evolve.  Despite these changes, the demand for telecommunications services as a whole, particularly data services, has remained strong, and telecommunications companies increasingly bundle services and provide integrated offerings for customers.  Hawaii’s telecommunications industry remains active, and demand for telecommunications services overall remains strong, due in part to the State’s geographic isolation. Hawaii is connected to the mainland United States and Asia via cable and several satellite networks.
     Our Business Strategy
     Our primary objective is to become the number one service provider of innovative “Always OnSM” communications, information and entertainment solutions to the people and businesses of Hawaii. The key elements of our business strategy are to grow our business with a focus on delivering superior service to our customers, which includes the following:
· | Leverage our broadband network. Our broadband network is the foundation for our services to our customers, and we continue to expand its footprint and invest in advanced technology platforms that support advanced communications and network services. We completed the build‑out of our Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) core network statewide and continue to deploy both fiber‑to‑the‑node (FTTN) and fiber‑to‑the‑premise (FTTP) access technologies to enhance and expand the speed and reach of our broadband network. We are deploying high‑speed technologies such as Very High Bit Rate Digital Subscriber Line Generation 2 (VDSL2), Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON), and Metro Ethernet to deliver new broadband services such as our next‑generation television to consumers, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Internet protocol Virtual Private Network (IP‑VPN), managed services, data center services, including colocation and virtual private cloud, and cloud‑based services to businesses. In both customer segments, we continue to enhance our services by adding new service options, features and functionality.

services, and cloud applications better positions us to compete for new customers and drive winback opportunities while also allowing us to improve retention of existing customers by migrating them from legacy services. Our next generation television service, Hawaiian Telcom TV, is an important growth component for our consumer products portfolio and critical to our strategy to win the home and capture a share of the significant television and entertainment market opportunity.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improve operating profitability and capital efficiencies. We strive to maintain a disciplined approach to managing operating expenses and capital spending. Our focus on driving operational improvements in our business has resulted in cost savings, and we continue to identify initiatives that we believe will further improve our cost structure. In addition, we continue to review and renegotiate contracts with key IT and outsource suppliers, which has led to additional cost savings. We manage our capital expenditures to optimize returns through disciplined planning and targeted investment of capital. Our strategy is to continue making strategic investments in our business in order to position the Company for long‑term growth. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In furtherance of the Company’s growth strategy, we continue to make important investments that further our business objectives:
    
· | In September 2013, we completed the acquisition of SystemMetrics Corporation (SystemMetrics), a leading provider of data center services in the State of Hawaii. The acquisition increased the scale and scope of our existing data center operations by adding a state‑of‑the art facility in Honolulu with 6,500 square feet of data center capacity and room for expansion. SystemMetrics complements our existing portfolio of business service offerings and enables us to further diversify our revenue base.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In August 2014, the Company joined a consortium of national and international companies to build and operate the Southeast Asia to United States (SEA-US) trans Pacific submarine cable system connecting Indonesia, the Philippines, Guam, Hawaii and the mainland United States. The cost to construct the system is expected to be approximately $235 million. The Company will pay $25 million over the multi-year construction period, with the majority to be paid at periodic milestones in 2016 and 2017, for a fractional ownership in the system, of which $16.6 million has been incurred through December 31, 2016. As part of this project, the Company has agreed to construct a cable landing station in Makaha, Hawaii, and to provide cable landing services to SEA-US. Management expects the system to be completed in the second half of 2017, and will provide an initial 20 Tbps of capacity using state of the art 100Gbps technology to accommodate the statewide increase in data consumption.

      Our Competitive Strengths
     We believe the following are among our core competitive strengths and enable us to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and help us successfully execute our business strategy:
· | Strong Local Presence. We have been serving Hawaii’s communities for over 132 years and employ approximately 1,300 employees statewide. Each year, we donate to various local charities and our employees volunteer thousands of hours of community service. Moreover, we believe we are able to understand our customers’ needs because our employees share many of those same needs. We also share Hawaii’s history, heritage, and strive to be an example of Hawaii’s unique values. Because we are locally managed, we believe we are more responsive to Hawaii’s consumers and businesses. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Growth‑Oriented Product Portfolio. We are the only communications service provider in our market that can provide the same broad array of services to both consumers and business customers that includes voice, Internet, data, CPE, wireless, advanced communications and IP‑based network services, managed services, data center services including colocation and virtual private cloud, and cloud‑based services. Our expanding service suite, including high‑quality enhanced data networking services such as our business VoIP and IP‑VPN services, our managed services, and our cloud applications are targeted at the key growth areas in our marketplace. Our next‑generation television service, employing Ericsson Mediaroom™, is

targeted at capturing a share of the significant video and entertainment market opportunity and also promotes pull-through sales of Internet service.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Advanced Network Infrastructure. We own one of the State’s most extensive and reliable communications networks, including one of the largest fiber optic cable networks in Hawaii. Our statewide MPLS backbone is one of the largest IP networks in Hawaii and allows us to deliver advanced IP‑based services to over 99% of the State’s population. Our network is supported by Hawaii’s only 24x7 state‑of‑the‑art network operations center. We continue to expand our fiber network and to enhance and expand the speed and reach of our broadband network, which we believe will enable us to offer new products and services that will generate growth in our business and allow us to compete more effectively in the marketplace. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong Management Team. We have assembled an experienced management team that we believe is well‑qualified to lead our Company and execute our strategy. Our management team has significant operational experience in the telecommunications industry combined with extensive knowledge of our local market, which we believe will continue to be a critical driver of our success going forward. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our Products and Services
     Telecommunications
     We generally classify our operations and related products and services into three core customer channels: Business, Consumer, and Wholesale.  Presented below is an overview of the products and services we offer in each customer channel.     Business Channel

 Data Services
     We provide a broad portfolio of data services, which we believe are a key growth area driven by demand for increasing bandwidth and more advanced data solutions from business customers.  We offer a range of broadband services including High-Speed Internet access, an asymmetrical broadband service geared toward small and medium-sized business customers, with speeds up to 1 Gigabits per second (Gbps) depending on the customer’s location, and Dedicated Internet Access (DIA), a symmetrical Internet access delivered over Ethernet with speeds up to 10 Gbps.  
     The role of business communication providers is evolving. Consistent with this, we have expanded into application centric, advanced communications and network services. Our services include Routed Network Service, a high performance IP virtual private networking service for business customers; Enhanced Internet Protocol Data Service, a multipoint switched Ethernet service; and Hosted PBX, a business VoIP service that provides businesses with a complete, converged communication solution in a hosted package.
     In addition to advanced communications and network services, we continue to provide special access tariff services such as frame relay, a shared wide area network service, and dedicated private lines.  See “—Regulation” for further discussion of special access.
     Voice Services
     Voice services include basic local phone and long distance services for business customers.  We provide basic local services generally for a fixed monthly recurring charge and can be enhanced with a variety of value  added services such as call waiting, caller ID, voice messaging, three way calling, call forwarding and speed dialing. Value added services may be purchased individually or as part of a package offering for a monthly recurring charge.  The rates that can be charged to customers for basic local and certain other services are regulated by the HPUC. We charge business customers higher rates to recover a portion of the costs of providing local service to residential customers, as is customary in the industry. See “—Regulation” for further discussion of regulatory matters.

     Equipment and Managed Services
     We have resale relationships and certifications with a number of branded technology vendors, which allows us to competitively sell and install a wide variety of telecommunications equipment such as key, PBX, and other hardware solutions.  In addition, we provide managed services as an end to end solution that manages, monitors, and supports a business’s network, CPE, and corporate data security. As business networks become more complex, the amount of time and capital businesses must spend to support their networks increases accordingly. Our managed services enable customers to focus on their core business by leaving the day to day management of their networks to us. Our managed services product portfolio consists of managed network and security services, IT professional services, and security consulting.     Consumer Channel

 Video Services
     We introduced our next-generation television service on the island of Oahu in July 2011. Our Hawaiian Telcom TV service is 100% digital with hundreds of local, national, international and music channels including high-definition, premium, Pay Per View channels and Video on Demand service. During 2016, we continued to invest in our network to provide integrated digital video, high-speed Internet and voice services to new and existing customers by adding 12,000 new households enabled for our TV service (“HHE”) bringing the total number of HHE to 202,000 as of the end of 2016. The addition of new HHE in our single family home footprint is expected to subside beginning in 2017.  Our IPTV service is expected to be a critical growth component for our consumer products portfolio and an anticipated anchor of our service bundling strategy. With television, we are now able to bundle digital video, high-speed Internet and voice services in certain areas of the island of Oahu.      Internet Services
     We provide high-speed Internet access to our residential customers with speeds up to 1 Gbps in the FTTP footprint.  For customers who order speeds of 50 Mbps or higher, we also offer Wi-Fi Plus, a premium program that provides customized solutions to maximize customers’ in-home Wi-Fi experience.     Voice Services
     Consumer voice services include basic local telephone and long distance services.  We provide additional value-added features such as call waiting, caller ID, voice messaging, three way calling, call forwarding and speed dialing. We also offer a variety of long distance plans, including rate plans based on minutes of use, flexible or unlimited long distance calling services.  The rates that can be charged to customers for basic local and certain other services are regulated by the HPUC.        Wholesale Channel

 We provide special access or network transport services to our wholesale customers, network operators and other telecommunications carriers.  Special access services include IP-based private networks, Ethernet, as well as Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), and Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) transport services.  See “—Regulation” for further discussion of special access.  In addition, we also provide wireless backhaul, or fiber-to-the-tower connections to support the growing demand for wireless broadband.       Other

 Other services include interstate and intrastate switched access for the origination, transport and termination of long distance calls (see “—Regulation” for further discussion of access charges), Connect America Fund support (see “—Regulation” for further discussion of universal service), operator services, billing and collection services and space

and power rents for colocation services.  We also provide other services including public pay telephone services at approximately 3,100 locations throughout the State of Hawaii. 
     In addition, we offer wireless services pursuant to a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) services agreement with Sprint Spectrum, L.P. (Sprint). That agreement allows us to resell Sprint wireless services, including access to Sprint’s nationwide personal communication service (PCS) wireless network to residential and business customers in Hawaii under the Hawaiian Telcom® brand name. The services agreement with Sprint was renewed in May 2015 for a 3-year term which expires in May 2018.
     Data Center Services
     We provide colocation and virtual private cloud data center services to our business customers. Colocation enables our customers to install and remotely operate their IT equipment. Virtual private cloud services include the use of shared virtualized computing resources and a variety of customer control features and services, including back up data storage and cloud-based network security. We also offer a complete cloud service portfolio that includes Desktop-as-a-Service product, Microsoft® Office 365 suite of cloud-based Software-as-a-Service products, along with Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Security-as-a-Service.  In addition, we provide related professional services, including planning, design, implementation and support services, to enable our customers to better manage and transition between their IT solutions.  We consider data center services as part of our business channel.     Markets and Customers
     Telecommunications
     We have been a telecommunications provider in Hawaii for more than 133 years. Our market consists of 86 central offices serving an area of approximately 6,263 square miles on the islands of Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, Kauai, Molokai and Lanai. We are the incumbent provider of local exchange services within this area and own the State’s most extensive local telecommunications network, with approximately 299,000 local access lines served as of December 31, 2016, of which 45% served residential customers, 54% served business customers, and the remaining 1% served other customers.
     Our market is characterized by high population density, with approximately 70% of the state’s population concentrated on Oahu over an area of approximately 598 square miles, or approximately 1,700 persons per square mile. In addition, approximately 34% of the households in Hawaii reside in multi dwelling units (MDUs)—approximately 44% on Oahu—compared with approximately 26% in the U.S. overall. This concentration of customers and commerce provides opportunities to leverage our network infrastructure to deliver products and services efficiently and in a cost effective manner and to market and sell our services more effectively. Given Hawaii’s geographic isolation and the diversity of its population, Hawaii residents and businesses may have telecommunications needs that are different from those on the mainland United States. Furthermore, in 2015, the median household income in Hawaii was estimated to exceed the national median household income by approximately $16,000. For the foregoing reasons, our strategy is to leverage the distinctive qualities of the Hawaii market to develop customized, local marketing strategies.
     Our business marketplace is dominated by several key industries. The federal government accounts for approximately 12% of gross state product. With the U.S. Pacific Command, one of the largest U.S. unified service commands, based in Hawaii, the federal government, collectively through its many departments and agencies, is one of our largest customers. Similarly, Hawaii state and local government, collectively through their many departments and agencies, constitutes a significant part of our business.  The hospitality industry and financial institutions also account for a significant portion of our business. The operations of these leading sectors are communications intensive, and we believe that they are dependent on our modern, reliable services. Hawaii’s small business market (in the aggregate) is also a key driver of Hawaii’s economy—approximately 95% of the companies in Hawaii employ fewer than 50 employees, and these businesses make up a market of approximately 37,000 businesses. We believe that these business customers represent an underserved segment that we are targeting aggressively with new product and service offerings.

 Data Center Services
     We believe there is a significant growth opportunity to provide data center services, including colocation and virtual private cloud, to businesses across the State of Hawaii. There are two important trends driving the growth in the adoption of data center services—the increasing use of cloud based technologies by business customers to run their most important business functions, and the increasing demand for outsourced solutions. At present, the percentage of businesses in Hawaii that use colocation and virtual private cloud services is small compared to utilization in similarly sized mainland U.S. markets.     Competition
     The telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We experience competition from many communications service providers, including the local cable operator Oceanic Time Warner (Oceanic), wireless carriers, long distance providers, competitive local exchange carriers, Internet service providers, Internet information providers, over‑the‑top hybrid voice providers, and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. Many of these companies have a strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to competition that may affect our future revenue growth. We expect competition to intensify as a result of the entrance of new competitors and the rapid development of new technologies, products and services.
     Oceanic, a subsidiary of Time Warner Cable Inc., the second largest cable operator in the United States, is the Company’s most significant competitor. Approximately 70% of the occupied households on Oahu that subscribe to television service subscribe to Oceanic’s cable television service. Oceanic also has the majority share of the high speed Internet market in Hawaii, which it uses as a platform to offer voice services utilizing VoIP technology, and markets its cable, high speed Internet, and voice services through competitive bundled offerings. In addition, Oceanic (now marketing business products under “Spectrum Business”) has targeted communications service offerings to small and medium sized businesses.  Oceanic competes aggressively with the Company on products, pricing and marketing.  In 2016, Charter Communications acquired Time Warner Cable Inc. but Oceanic continued to operate business-as-usual. In April 2017, Charter is expected to introduce its products and pricing in Hawaii.
     Wireless communications services continue to constitute a significant source of competition with traditional wireline phone service, especially as wireless carriers expand and improve their network coverage and continue to lower their prices. As a result, many customers have chosen to completely forego use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless services. We anticipate the wireless substitution trend will continue, and could pose additional threat to our high speed Internet product, particularly if wireless service rates continue to decline and the wireless service providers are able to deliver faster data speeds. Over the top hybrid providers, such as Skype and Magic Jack, also offer the capability to provide local voice and long distance calls using an Internet equipped personal computer.
     The advanced communications and network services business, as well as the managed services, data center services including colocation and virtual private cloud, and cloud based services businesses, are highly competitive due to the absence of significant barriers to entry. The emergence of non-traditional, application centric players in the market is redefining the role of service providers in these fields.
     We are uniquely positioned in the State to bundle data center services with network, managed services, data communications equipment and support services for an end to end, statewide solution. Due to the high cost of commercial real estate in the State of Hawaii, there is a limited inventory of colocation data center space available for Hawaii businesses. There are numerous other providers of cloud based software, including system integrators in Hawaii and web based service providers, that offer software subscriptions and virtual machines on cloud based servers housed in data centers on the mainland U.S. and internationally. However, such out of state solutions raise concerns regarding response latency, the higher cost of private network connectivity from Hawaii and data security. 
     We employ a number of strategies to combat the competitive pressures we face. Our strategies are focused on preserving and generating new revenues through customer retention, upgrading and upselling services to existing customers, new customer growth, winbacks of former customers, new product and feature deployment, and by managing 

 
  7

 
our profitability and cash flow through targeted reductions in operating expenses and efficient deployment of capital. We believe the key to success in these strategies is the continued enhancement and expansion in the speed and reach of our broadband network, which we believe will enable us to offer new products and services that will generate growth in our business and allow us to compete more effectively in the marketplace. Another key to success is a focus on enhancing the customer experience, as we believe exceptional customer service will differentiate us from our competition. Customers expect industry leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the requirement of the carrier to excel in this area is crucial for customer retention.
     Network Architecture and Technology
     Our strategy is to enhance and expand the most technologically advanced broadband communications network in the state of Hawaii and to position ourselves as a key hub for critical trans-Pacific traffic. Pursuing such a strategy has enabled us, among other things, to continue being the market leader in Hawaii for advanced communications and network services and managed and cloud-based services. In 2016, we invested approximately $79 million in our network including significant expenditures to expand the reach, capacity, and resiliency of our IP-based packet and broadband network. Significant strides were made in 2016 to add hundreds of miles to our fiber network and continuing our transformation toward an optical, IP-based broadband network. Additionally, we believe that our commitment to the SEA-US trans-pacific submarine cable system will enable us to expand data connectivity beyond Hawaii to both the Asia/Pacific and Continental U.S. locations.
     MPLS and Transport Network
     We believe that our statewide MPLS network is unmatched in Hawaii in reach, capacity, security, resiliency, and reliability. Consisting of two provider core routers, eight provider edge routers, and 39 service edge routers meshed throughout the island chain, we offer a wide range of Layer 2 and Layer 3 MPLS services with many advanced features, including advanced traffic engineering support of intelligent QoS (Quality of Service) Service OAM (operations, administration, and management) capabilities, multiple access technologies, standards based routing protocols, Internet access across a single physical connection, and up to 100Gb Ethernet access. Driven by continued high bandwidth demands from our high-speed Internet service, next-generation television service, wireless backhaul, and other retail and wholesale business requirements, in 2016 we continued to expand our next generation network with the introduction of a provider core architecture that simplifies our overall network while increasing scale and maintaining the level of resiliency expected by our customers. These interconnected platforms combine wave division multiplexing (WDM) transport, reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADM), and centralized carrier Ethernet switching in a single converged device helping us to meet the growing bandwidth needs at a more affordable price. Our current backbone infrastructure consists of two border routers with diverse trans-Pacific links to mainland carriers, along with expanded peering and content caching arrangements with global providers to reduce latency and buffering to our customers. In 2017, we plan to continue to expand bandwidth capacity in the border and core sections of our MPLS network to accommodate increased demand and utilize our trans-pacific submarine cable system for direct connections to the world’s leading internet carriers.
     Our telecommunication infrastructure includes more than 16,000 sheath miles of fiber optic cable and copper wire distribution lines. Submarine and deep-sea fiber optic cables connect the islands of Kauai, Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Hawaii, while digital microwave radios provide backup inter island connections. In addition to our owned or leased interisland cables between Oahu, Kauai, Maui, Hawaii, Molokai, and Lanai, we are connected by trans-Pacific fiber optic cables to the U.S. Mainland, which provide ring diversity to protect our communications between the islands and high-speed broadband links in and out of the State.
     Voice Network
     We continue to add services and features via our VoIP application servers to provide Hawaii businesses the communication tools they need to compete locally and globally. In 2016, we extended our VoIP platform with Unified Collaboration (UC) features such as Instant Messaging and Presence.

 As of December 31, 2016, we operated 99 local base and remote switches and five tandem switches on the islands of Hawaii, Kauai, Lanai, Maui, Molokai and Oahu. All of our legacy access lines are served by digital switches provided predominantly by Nokia (formerly Alcatel-Lucent) and Genband.
     Network Optimization Initiatives
     To lower on going operational costs and to adjust our capacity to account for legacy revenue attrition, we optimized portions of our network. We exited two legacy Wavecom leased sites, shut down our oldest WDM network consisting of five nodes, and exited two Hawaiian Telcom radio facilities.  We expect to increase the pace of optimizing our legacy network infrastructure in 2017.     Access Infrastructure
     In 2016, we continued our aggressive investment to transform our access network to a high-speed, fiber-based broadband network and now have approximately 202,000 households enabled on our next generation broadband network.  An additional 3,900 business addresses are also on our GPON network. GPON is a FTTP solution providing a complete fiber connection to businesses allowing for transmission speeds of over 1 Gbps.  Continued deployment of FTTP solutions will serve new (greenfield) MDU, single family subdivision developments, and targeted business corridors. By laying fiber and utilizing various passive optical network components from these developments to our central offices, we can further leverage the capabilities of our MPLS backbone, provide higher bandwidth services to our customers, including our television service, and reduce maintenance costs. We also continued to expand our fiber network deeper into neighborhoods, shortening over 1,400 customer loops in 2016 to 3,000 feet or less using FTTN technology, expanded our fiber networks to approximately 491 cell sites across the state of Hawaii to provide backhaul services to our wireless carrier customers, and fine-tuned our FTTP access infrastructure to accommodate 1 Gbps download speed internet bandwidth in selected areas on all major islands. These network enhancements allowed the increased penetration and expansion of higher broadband services including our television service.  In 2016, we concluded our NGN build to residential addresses on Oahu.  Our 2017 plans includes further expansion of our next-generation broadband network in business areas.
     In 2016, we concluded Phase I of the federal Connect America Fund (CAF) program to provide high speed data services to a total of approximately 1,800 underserved and unserved locations on the island of Hawaii.  Our 2017 plans include a continuation of expansion of providing broadband to additional CAF-eligible areas as part of our Phase II federal grant.
     Next-Generation Television Service
     The implementation of IP-based television service is driving one of the largest network transformations in the telecommunications industry. We introduced our next-generation television service on the island of Oahu in July 2011, deploying the service to both copper-fed and fiber-fed customers and converting entire MDU complexes to our new service. Utilizing Ericsson Mediaroom™ middleware, we provide a wide range of content and multimedia services over our IP based network and provide our customers with new viewing experiences and applications, such as Whole Home DVR (Digital Video Recorder), instant channel change, brilliant picture and sound quality, and over 80 TV Everywhere apps that allow customers to view content on mobile devices. We continue to see strong demand for our television service.     Network Surveillance and Operations
     Our statewide network infrastructure is monitored and managed by our Network Operations Center (NOC) located in Honolulu. The eNOC provides surveillance 24x7, 365 days-a-year, for our statewide network consisting of 86 central offices, TV head-end facility, associated interoffice facilities, microwave radio towers, and E911 facilities. Our network infrastructure for voice, data, and video is monitored proactively with state-of-the-art performance and fault management systems. Customer networks are also monitored proactively by our Managed Services team. We have a customer service center which also operates on a 24x7, 365 days-a-year basis to handle customer inquiries and repairs, and provide call completion services. All customer installations and repairs requiring a field technician are offered

during extended hours and coordinated by our Dispatch Center. All construction activity, for both outside and inside plant, is coordinated by our engineering operations team located at our main office on Oahu.
     In addition to our network infrastructure, we operate a wide range of equipment from large boom trucks to small passenger vehicles, mobile generators, and other miscellaneous trailers, tools and test equipment. We own or lease most of our administrative and maintenance facilities, central offices, remote switching platforms, and transport and distribution network facilities. With limited exception, our assets are located exclusively in the state of Hawaii.
     Information Technology and Support Systems
     Our IT-related initiatives continue to be aimed at delivering advanced technologies to our customers as well as delivering a superior customer service experience. Our systems have evolved and we continue to focus our strategy towards customer-centric architectures. This approach focuses on delivering end-to-end system solutions based on customer improvement initiatives integrated into product development. The service delivery mechanisms are comprised of a mixture of commercial off-the-shelf-systems, internally designed and developed systems that are purpose built for functions unique to our product offerings, and select niche applications that offer optimal capabilities and flexibility at the network layer.
     As part of our ongoing commitment to customer service, we implemented improvements in 2016 to our customer contact center systems with the implementation of a 360° customer view and a significant upgrade to the latest IVR/ACD technology. In addition, in 2016 we provided our sales force with new system capabilities in support of our next generation network for quicker quoting.
     We continue to focus efforts on flow-through automation from order entry through billing, and in 2016 we continued to implement improvements which reduced manual processing of complex orders, increased productivity, and enhanced overall data quality. We made further improvements in 2016 through consolidation of order entry process and systems. We improved our field dispatch and fiber provisioning systems to increase installation efficiency of our next generation network. In 2017, we plan to continue to make improvements through version upgrades of our existing Business Order entry systems, IVR/ACD, and our provisioning and inventory management applications.
     As is the case with other telecommunications companies, we are an on-going target for cyber criminals. In response, we have aggressively pursued initiatives to reduce our cyber security related risks.  In 2016, we adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework to guide our current and future cybersecurity standards, policies, guidelines and practices.  Using this framework, we implemented a unified security management infrastructure to consolidate our cybersecurity threat detection and intelligence in addition to deploying additional security control points to improve our security posture.  We continue to provide our employees, contractors and vendors awareness including evolution of our corporate cybersecurity communications and policies.   Hawaiian Telcom also provides cybersecurity awareness to our customers and the Hawaii community in general.  In 2017, we continued our investment in security access, control points and systems as our Information Technology evolved in the areas of mobility and cloud services.   In addition, we continue to leverage government resources at the federal, state and local levels to enhance the cybersecurity of Hawaiian Telcom’s network and services.  These and other investments reflect our on-going commitment to securing our information assets and protecting sensitive data in our information systems.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 1,300 full‑time employees in Hawaii. Of the total employees, approximately 55% were represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 1357 pursuant to a five‑year collective bargaining agreement that expires at the end of 2017. Negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement are expected to begin on or before May 1, 2017.  We believe that management currently has a constructive relationship with the represented and non‑ represented employee group.

 Insurance
     We have insurance to cover risks incurred in the ordinary course of business, including errors and omissions, cyber liability, general liability, property coverage (which includes business interruption), director and officers and employment practices liability, auto, crime, fiduciary and worker’s compensation insurance in amounts typical of similar operators in our industry and with reputable insurance providers. Central office equipment, buildings, furniture and fixtures and certain operating and other equipment are insured under a blanket property insurance program. This program provides substantial coverage against “all risks” of loss including fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake, and other perils not specifically excluded by the terms of the policies. As is typical in the telecommunications industry, we are self‑insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities, including our buried, undersea and above‑ground transmission lines. We believe that our insurance coverage is adequate; however, the incurrence of substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.     Regulation
     Federal and State Regulation of Telecommunications Services
     Our telephone operations generally are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to interstate services and the HPUC with respect to intrastate services. The following summary does not purport to describe all current and proposed applicable federal and state regulation.     Competition
     We face increasing competition in all areas of our business. Regulatory changes brought on by the 1996 amendments to the Communications Act, regulatory and judicial actions, and the development of new technologies, products and services have created opportunities for alternative telecommunication service providers, many of which are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than our ILEC. We are unable to predict definitively the impact that the ongoing changes in the telecommunications industry will ultimately have on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The financial impact will depend on several factors, including the timing, extent and success of competition in our markets, the timing and outcome of various regulatory proceedings and any appeals, the timing, extent and success of our pursuit of new opportunities resulting from the amendments to the Communications Act and technological advances, and any changes in the state or federal laws or regulations governing communications.     Universal Service
     As a provider of interstate telecommunications, we are required to contribute to federal universal service programs. The FCC adjusts the contribution amount quarterly and may increase or decrease this amount depending on demand for support and the total base of contributors. We previously drew Interstate Access Support of approximately $1.9 million annually from this funding, which was phased out in 2015 after we accepted Connect America Fund (CAF) Phase II support, as further described below.
     In November 2011, the FCC released its “Connect America Fund” Order which adopted a number of proposals relating to reforming existing universal service support mechanisms. Among other things, the Order transformed the FCC’s universal service and intercarrier compensation systems into a new Connect America Fund (CAF), which funds broadband deployment in census blocks that the FCC has determined are unserved by an unsubsidized wireline competitor. For price cap carriers such as our subsidiary Hawaiian Telcom, Inc., CAF Phase II support is distributed pursuant to a forward looking cost model. In August 2015, we notified the FCC that we would accept CAF Phase II support which amounts to $4.4 million in annual funding for six years for the calendar years 2015-2020. Under the terms of CAF Phase II, we will offer broadband service at 10 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream or better to approximately 11,000 eligible locations in high-cost areas in the State of Hawaii and will provide voice and broadband services at reasonable rates.  In addition, the FCC previously awarded Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. approximately $400,000 in CAF Phase I Round 1 support and approximately $1 million in CAF Phase I Round 2 support.  Broadband deployment obligations for Rounds 1 and 2 have been completed. The FCC is expected to issue additional clarifications relating to CAF Phase II including the methodology for measuring broadband speeds but we do not know if this will impact our 

 
  11

 
ability to meet the program obligations and result in a loss of some of the support if program obligations are not fully met in a timely manner.
     Government Regulation of Retail Rates
     The FCC and the HPUC are the two agencies that regulate our telecommunications services. In general, the FCC regulates interstate service, and the HPUC regulates intrastate service. The HPUC has, slowly over time, reduced its rate regulation of some of our services. The HPUC classifies all regulated telecommunications services as fully competitive, partially competitive, or non‑competitive.
     In 2009 and 2010, the Hawaii State Legislature required the HPUC to treat all intrastate retail telecommunications services, including intrastate toll (i.e., inter island), central exchange (Centrex), most residential and business local exchange services, integrated service digital network (ISDN) private lines and special assemblies, and directory assistance, as “fully competitive” under the HPUC’s rules with certain qualifications. HPUC approval and cost support filings are no longer required to establish or reduce rates or to bundle service offerings; however, all service offerings must be priced above the service’s long run incremental cost, and the HPUC can require cost support demonstrating compliance with its costing rules at any time. The HPUC retains the ability to suspend and investigate any offering.  In 2012, the Hawaii State Legislature further leveled the regulatory playing field by providing us with pricing flexibility to increase tariffed intrastate rates for any retail telecommunications service without approval from the HPUC with the exception of basic exchange service. (i.e., single line residential and single line business services), which continue to require HPUC approval. Competitive forces, however, may cause us to be unable to raise our local rates in the future.
     The classification of retail local exchange intrastate services as fully competitive and the ability to bundle the services with other fully or partially competitive services or other services that are not within the HPUC’s jurisdiction enable us to charge a discounted rate for bundled service offerings and have helped us to be more competitive.
     State and Federal Regulation of Long Distance Services
     We are subject to certain conditions imposed by the HPUC and the FCC on the manner in which we conduct our long distance operations. For example, we are prohibited from joint ownership of local and long‑distance telephone transmission or switching facilities. The HPUC is responsible for ensuring that our ILEC does not discriminate against other long distance providers.     Federal Requirements
     As an ILEC, we are subject to federal laws governing a number of access and interconnection requirements, other competitive obligations. Among other things, an ILEC must negotiate in good faith with other carriers requesting interconnection and access to unbundled network elements (UNEs) and must offer its competitors access to UNEs, such as local loops and inter office transport, at regulated rates. The FCC also has limited our obligation to unbundle fiber facilities to multiple dwelling units, such as apartment buildings, and to homes and offices deployed in FTTC and FTTP arrangements. In addition, federal law regulates competitors’ requests to colocate facilities within our central offices and to have access to our subscriber list information in order to produce competing directories. The FCC also has imposed specific rules regarding the manner and time within which a customer’s telephone number must be ported to a competing carrier’s service, and has strict guidelines prohibiting the ILEC’s use of this information for any other purposes.     Interstate and Intrastate Access Charges
     The rates that we can charge for interstate access are regulated by the FCC. The FCC has made various reforms to the existing rate structure for access charges, which, combined with greater competition, have caused the aggregate amount of access charges paid by long distance carriers to decrease over time. 
     Our interstate and intrastate access charge levels have been and will continue to be fundamentally affected by the FCC’s reform of intercarrier compensation, described below.

 
  12

 

     Federal Framework for Intercarrier Compensation
     In its “Connect America Fund” Order (see “—Universal Service” above) that reformed universal service, the FCC also fundamentally restructured the regulatory regime for intercarrier compensation, which consists of state and interstate access charges and local reciprocal compensation. Among other things, this comprehensive reform unifies state and interstate intercarrier charges in certain circumstances, provides a mechanism to replace intercarrier revenues lost through rate unification, and resolves prospectively a number of outstanding disputes among carriers regarding interconnection and compensation obligations. In particular, the FCC’s order required that price-cap carriers reduce interstate and intrastate terminating switched access rates to $.0007 over a six year phase-down period.  The FCC also required that most intercarrier compensation be eliminated, and that a system of “bill & keep” replace it whereby the carrier would have to seek recovery of its costs entirely from its own end users. In the interim, the FCC capped most existing intercarrier compensation rates and established a phase down of those rates over a six-year period for price cap companies such as Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. To partially offset the resulting decrease in revenues, the Commission authorized Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. to assess its end user customers a limited recovery charge that would increase over the time period during which intercarrier compensation rates decline, then would be phased out over a three-year period beginning in 2017. Finally, the FCC decided that interstate access charges should apply to VoIP or other Internet protocol based service providers on a prospective basis, subject to the same interim phase down requirements described above. The FCC found that carriers should have the opportunity to make up for any loss of revenues either through the established recovery mechanisms or through the sale of additional services, such as broadband and television services. 
     Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. has implemented the first five phases of the intercarrier compensation reform, offsetting a portion of the resulting revenue loss through the FCC-authorized monthly recurring access recovery charge for certain classes of customers.
     In a separate proceeding, the FCC found that Internet bound traffic is not subject to reciprocal compensation under Section 251(b)(5) of the Communications Act. Instead, the FCC established a federal rate cap for this traffic, which is and will remain $0.0007 per minute until the FCC decides otherwise.
     Special Access
     The FCC has adopted rules for special access services that provide for pricing flexibility and ultimately the removal of services from price regulation when prescribed competitive thresholds are met. We currently have pricing flexibility for certain special access services offered throughout our territory. In the first quarter of 2015, Hawaiian Telcom, as a provider of dedicated special access services, complied with the FCC’s order for a mandatory special access data collection by filing detailed information concerning carrier services provided to enterprise and wholesale customers, including special access services. The FCC has used the data collected to evaluate competition in the market for special access services and to help the FCC decide whether to modify the special access pricing rules for price cap carriers, including whether the pricing flexibility rules should be modified or eliminated. The FCC has compiled the data and our economic consultant, hired by a consortium in which we participate with six other price cap carriers, has submitted their findings that competition in the special access market is robust and that pricing flexibility should be continued. We also filed comments in support of these findings with respect to the Hawaii market. In late 2016, the FCC Chairman circulated an Order that would have reduced BDS prices for certain legacy services over three years but this order was not voted on and it is uncertain when this proceeding will be concluded or what impact it will have on providers of dedicated special access services, especially in light of the pending change in the FCC Chairperson. 
     In October 2015, the FCC initiated an investigation into the terms and conditions of the special access service pricing plans of four large price cap carriers (AT&T, CenturyLink, Frontier, and Verizon).  Issues designated for investigation included whether the following practices were just and reasonable practices under the Communications Act (Act): (1) percentage commitments based on a purchaser’s historical or existing levels of purchases; (2) shortfall fees; (3) upper percentage thresholds; (4) overage penalties; (5) certain long-term commitments; and (6) early-termination fees.  The investigation also considered whether certain commercial agreements should be subject to the filing requirements of the Act and whether the special access pricing plans inhibit the transition from TDM-based special access to IP-based

services.    In May 2016 the FCC ordered the affected carriers to remove such provisions from their tariffs by July 1, 2016.  We do not know if and when we may be required to remove similar provisions from our tariffs.
     Federal Regulatory Classification of Broadband and Internet Services
     The FCC has been considering whether, and under what circumstances, services that employ Internet protocol are “telecommunications services” subject to regulations that apply to other telecommunications services, but it has not definitively ruled on the issue and instead has made a series of decisions addressing specific services and regulations. 
     In March 2006, a request of Verizon that sought forbearance from Title II regulation for certain advanced broadband special access services was deemed granted by operation of law. This forbearance grant was applicable to us since Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. was part of Verizon when the original Verizon petition for forbearance was filed. This action permitted us to deregulate covered advanced broadband special access services, giving us greater flexibility in our pricing and terms and conditions for eligible services. In October 2011, tw telecom of hawaii l.p. and others filed a petition requesting the FCC to reverse in part the forbearance deemed granted to Verizon. We filed comments in opposition to the petition. In November 2012, the Ad Hoc Telecommunications Users Committee and others filed a petition requesting the FCC to reverse in part the forbearance for Verizon and other grants of forbearance by the FCC related to advanced broadband special access services. There is no definite timeframe for an FCC decision on these petitions, which may be addressed as part of the special access proceeding.
     In December 2010, the FCC adopted “net neutrality” rules, termed “open Internet” rules that would bar Internet service providers from blocking or slowing Web content sent to homes and businesses. The rules continue to treat broadband Internet access services under the FCC’s Title I authority, but adopted as rules the existing guidelines applicable to Internet service providers. The FCC also adopted three additional rules concerning blocking, non discrimination, and transparency. The anti-discrimination and no blocking rules were vacated by a federal court of appeals, but the public disclosure requirement remains in place.
     In February 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband service, both fixed and mobile, from its longstanding status as a Title I information service to a Title II common carrier telecommunications service. While reasonable network management is permitted, the open Internet order bans blocking legal content/applications, throttling lawful traffic and paid prioritization or “fast lanes”, expands transparency rules and creates a general conduct rule to bar broadband Internet service providers from unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging the ability of consumers and edge providers to reach and communicate with each other. Further, the FCC granted new authority to address Internet interconnection issues arising in the exchange of traffic between mass market broadband providers and other networks and services such as edge providers. While the order grants forbearance from many Title II provisions such as rate regulation or tariffs, last mile unbundling, burdensome filing requirements/accounting standards, USF contributions, and any new taxes or fees, uncertainty looms concerning continued forbearance in future years. All the new rules will be effective the first quarter of 2017, but Congress is considering adopting open Internet legislation to prevent Title II regulation of broadband services, and there are indications that the FCC may also reassess its reclassification of broadband service to a Title II common carrier telecommunications service given the pending changes at the FCC. We do not know what the final outcome of these actions will be, or how our broadband services may be affected.
     Video Services Regulation
     Through our Hawaiian Telcom Services Company, Inc. subsidiary, we began to provide television service on the island of Oahu in July 2011. We are regulated as a cable TV operator under federal and state law. As the non‑dominant video service provider in the state of Hawaii, we face the risk that we will be unable to obtain access to programming that we need in order to compete with Oceanic Time Warner (Oceanic), the dominant cable TV provider in the state. Some of this programming is owned by the parent company of Oceanic, which may or may not be required to provide access to us under the FCC’s program access rules.
     In October 2012, the FCC issued an order lifting the program access rule ban on exclusive contracts between any cable operator and any cable‑affiliated programming vendor. It also issued a separate notice seeking comment on whether (1) to establish a rebuttable presumption that an exclusive contract for a cable‑affiliated Regional Sports 

 
  14

 
Network (RSN) is an unfair act; (2) it should establish a standstill provision during an RSN‑related complaint; and (3) the presumptions for RSNs should be extended to a cable‑affiliated national sports network. The FCC found a preemptive prohibition on exclusive contracts is no longer necessary and that a case‑by‑case process will remain in place to assess the impact of individual exclusive contracts. The FCC order provides a 45‑day answer period for all complaints and a six‑month deadline for it to act on a complaint alleging a denial of programming. The order also incorporates safeguards regarding RSNs, by establishing a rebuttable presumption that an exclusive contract involving a cable‑affiliated RSN has the “purpose or effect” of “significantly hindering or preventing” the complainant from providing television services, placing the burden of proof on the distributor.
     In December 2012, the FCC granted a complaint filed by the Mauna Kea Broadcasting Company with the FCC seeking to place its over-the-air broadcasting station KLEI TV on both Oceanic’s and our television systems. The order required us to place KLEI TV on channel 6, which is already occupied by another programming station. Both Oceanic and Hawaiian Telcom Services Company, Inc. have filed a petition for reconsideration of this decision, which effectively stays the mandate of the order until all appeals are resolved. We cannot predict when or how the FCC will resolve this petition.
     In June 2015, Charter Communications Inc. filed applications with the FCC, HPUC and Hawaii State Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (“DCCA”) Cable TV Division for approval of the merger of Charter Communications, Inc. ("Charter") and Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC), which owns Oceanic, the dominant cable TV provider in Hawaii.  In this same transaction, Charter is also merging with Advance/Newhouse Partnership (“Advance”), which provides video services through Bright House Networks, LLC in six states, excluding Hawaii. We filed comments with the FCC and DCCA that given Oceanic’s large market share in both the video and broadband markets, conditions specific to the Hawaii market should be placed on the acquisition so that the merger will not further stifle competition and harm the video programming and wired broadband markets in Hawaii.  Final approval of the transaction with limited non-Hawaii specific conditions was granted in May 2016.
     In October 2016, the FCC adopted a Broadband Privacy order that requires broadband Internet service providers (ISPs) to obtain “opt-in” permission before using or sharing information about the sites their customers visit on the Internet and their online communications but allows the ISPs to use non-sensitive information on an opt-out basis—that is, unless the consumer takes affirmative action to object.  The order also imposes data security and breach notification requirements, as well as transparency requirements regarding notice of information collection, how it is used, who it is shared with, and customer options for granting or denying permission. Privacy information must be “persistently” available on the ISP’s website or mobile app.
     The order abandons the three-tier usage-based privacy framework for broadband ISPs in favor of an approach that bases privacy obligations on the sensitivity of the information being used or shared and in some areas is inconsistent with the FTC’s technology-neutral privacy regime. The FCC’s order is subject to numerous petitions for reconsideration. We do not know what the final outcome will be, or how our broadband services may be affected.
     Other Federal and State Regulatory Proceedings
     The FCC has been exploring whether to modify its rules requiring utilities to provide telecommunications carriers and cable television companies with access to their poles, ducts, and rights of way. In April 2011, the FCC adopted new pole attachment rules that, among other things, require access to poles and conduit within a shorter period of time, and further limit make ready costs. In addition, these new rules change the rates for pole attachments by mandating that broadband attachers pay pole attachment rates that are closer to existing cable TV rates, than higher rates applicable to telecommunications carriers. These rules also for the first time allow telephone companies to demand reasonable rates from utility pole owners. These rules tend to increase the burdens and costs of pole and conduit owners such as us. The rules were upheld on appeal in February 2013. In December 2015, the FCC further revised the formula for calculating pole attachment rates for telecommunications carriers.  The change will ensure that pole attachment rates for telecommunications attachers, including providers of broadband Internet access service (BIAS), approximate the rates for cable attachers.  In November 2013, the FCC adopted rules to improve the reliability and resiliency of 911 communications networks nationwide by requiring that 911 service providers take reasonable measures to provide reliable 911 service, as evidenced by an annual certification. Providers can comply with this requirement by either 

 
  15

 
implementing certain industry backed “best practices”, or by implementing alternative measures that are reasonably sufficient to ensure reliable 911 service. As a 911 service provider, Hawaiian Telcom Inc. filed its annual certification that it was 100% compliant by October 2016 with the new 911 communications networks reliability and resiliency standards.
     In August 2015, the FCC adopted rules concerning the transition from the copper-based Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) network to a fiber-based Internet Protocol (IP) network. To address backup power requirements for residential consumers of IP based voice and data services that replace the traditional telephony used to dial 911, effective February 2016, prior to switching facilities-based, fixed, residential voice services from copper, which is line-powered, to fiber, Hawaiian Telcom must educate affected residential subscribers on the impact of this switch, and offer these subscribers the option to purchase a backup power solution that provides at least eight hours of standby power during a commercial power outage. Within three years, in accordance with FCC requirements, Hawaiian Telcom is required to offer at least one option that provides a minimum of 24 hours standby power.  The purpose of the requirement is to ensure consumers can make calls to 911 in the event of a power outage. 
     In a separate proceeding, the FCC also adopted rules governing the retirement of copper loops and the discontinuance of legacy services used as a wholesale input. Among other things, ILECs will be required to: (1) provide interconnecting entities at least six months’ advance notice of proposed copper retirement; and (2) consider the impact of their actions on the end-users of carrier-customers when discontinuing, reducing, or impairing a service used as a wholesale input. In order to receive authority to discontinue, reduce, or impair either special access services at DS1 speed and above or commercial wholesale platform service, ILECs will also be required to provide competing carriers with wholesale access to their IP services on reasonably comparable rates, terms, and conditions. The FCC’s order is subject to a court appeal and it is uncertain when this will be resolved.  
     In October 2015, Black Diamond Capital Management, LLC, (“Black Diamond”) which through two of its managed investment funds, collectively owns approximately 24.1% of the total outstanding common stock of Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc. (Holdco), filed an application with the HPUC requesting approval to increase its ownership up to 33% of the outstanding common stock of Holdco. Under state law, no more than twenty-five percent of the issued and outstanding voting stock of a corporation organized under the laws of the State and who owns, controls, operates, or manages a public utility shall be held, by any single foreign corporation or any single nonresident alien, or held by any person, unless prior written approval is obtained from the HPUC. Hawaiian Telcom supported Black Diamond’s request based on the Standstill and Support Agreement between Black Diamond and Hawaiian Telcom.  In May 2016, the HPUC granted Black Diamond approval, with conditions, to increase its ownership up to 31.5% of the outstanding common stock of the Company.
     In December 2015, the FCC, responding to a forbearance petition filed by USTelecom in late 2014, released an order removing certain regulatory requirements for legacy voice services that are no longer relevant in today's marketplace. The FCC granted forbearance from FCC rules regarding the unbundling of 64 kbps voice-grade channels. The FCC's rules previously required unbundling of such channels in order to provide narrowband services over fiber where an ILEC retires a copper loop it has overbuilt with FTTP or FTTC. The FCC granted forbearance, subject to a narrow, targeted "grandfathering" condition, under which incumbents must maintain access to unbundled 64 kbps channels that are in use as of the adopted date of the order. The FCC also granted forbearance from rules requiring ILECs to provide access to newly-deployed entrance conduit in “greenfield” (new developments) situations to competitive LECs at regulated rates. The FCC, however, denied forbearance for “brownfield” situations (existing developments) because that concluded that ILECs have a "pre-existing advantage" in brownfield deployments that merited different treatment. The removal of these requirements helps to level the playing field in the increasingly competitive telecommunications market by relieving us of some of the outdated obligations to provide competitive access.  
     Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
     We are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern our operations and may adversely affect our costs. Some of our properties use, or may have used in the past, on‑site facilities or underground storage tanks for the storage of hazardous materials that could create the potential for the release of 

 
  16

 
hazardous substances or contamination of the environment. We cannot predict with any certainty our future capital expenditure requirements for environmental regulatory compliance, although we have not currently identified any of our facilities as requiring material expenditures for environmental remediation or to achieve compliance with environmental regulations.
