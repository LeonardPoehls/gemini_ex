Overview
Bazaarvoice was founded on the premise that the collective voice of the consumer is the most powerful marketing tool in the world. Our solutions and services allow our retailer and brand clients to understand that consumer voice and the role it plays in influencing purchasing decisions, both online and offline. Our solutions capture, manage and display consumer-generated content including ratings and reviews, questions and answers, customer stories, and social posts, photos, and videos. This content is syndicated and distributed across our clients' marketing channels, including category/product pages, search terms, brand sites, mobile applications, in-store displays and paid and earned advertising. This consumer-generated content enables our clients to generate more revenue, market share and brand affinity. Our solutions are designed to empower our clients to leverage insights derived from consumer-generated content to improve marketing effectiveness, increase success of new product launches, improve existing products and services, effectively scale customer support, decrease product returns, reach consumers when actively shopping via highly targeted audience advertising, and enable retailers to launch and manage on-site advertising solutions and site monetization strategies.
Consumers’ decisions to purchase products and services can be directly affected by other consumers' input, comments and opinions. Consumers often trust and rely on what other consumers say about a brand, product, or service, particularly if they consider the content to be authentic and credible. Consumer interaction through online social channels has significantly increased the volume and availability of online consumer-generated content about products and services, which is proven to have a significant and growing influence on both online and offline purchases. The rapid adoption of web-enabled mobile devices is further amplifying the impact of online consumer-generated content by making this content even easier, more convenient, and faster to generate and access. As a result, there has been a paradigm shift in retailer and brand marketing in response to this “connected economy” in which shared, collaborative relationships are networked between businesses, clients, and other influencers. Traditional methods are being disrupted and businesses are now seeking solutions that embrace online consumer-generated content to more effectively engage, influence, and tap into the collective power of consumers.
Our solutions, which are primarily provided via a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, platform, enable our clients to:


• | capture and display consumer-generated content, such as online ratings and reviews, photos, and questions and answers about specific products and services, which creates consumer confidence and increases conversion rates;


• | syndicate that consumer-generated content into our vast network of brand and retail clients where it can further influence online and in-store purchases;


• | understand consumer sentiment so our clients can respond to what consumers want; and


• | monetize the value of that content through targeted advertising based on online and offline shopping behavior.

Our Platforms and Solutions
Our products and services solve marketing challenges.
Bazaarvoice knows the issues and challenges marketers face in getting their products in front of the right people at the right time. Our products and solutions were created to solve these challenges by:

• | Enhancing brand and retailer preferences by providing highly relevant and trusted content at key points in the consumer's purchase journey, which increases purchase conversion both online and in-store;


• | Acquiring new customers by reaching one of the largest networks of shoppers in the world;


• | Driving loyalty by using shopper behavior to improve and personalize the customer experience; and


• | Building awareness by leveraging review content to enhance search engine optimization (“SEO”) and marketing performance.

These solutions can be broken down into two broad categories of products and services.
1) The Collection, Curation and Analysis of Consumer-Generated Content:
Bazaarvoice Conversations Platform
Our Conversations platform provides our retailer and brand clients with capabilities to capture, manage and display online consumer-generated content. Consumers interact with our solutions as they view or author consumer reviews, questions, photos, videos, long-format narratives and other forms of consumer-generated content. Content that is displayed by our Conversations platform may be styled to match our clients’ brand, preserving important branding elements of our clients’ businesses.
Content captured and managed by our Conversations platform may be used by our clients in their online websites, mobile-optimized websites, mobile applications, social networks, in-store kiosks, physical in-store displays, printed flyers, email and other forms of online and offline media.
Key products and features of our Conversations platform include:


• | Ratings & Reviews. Allows our clients to capture, manage and display consumer reviews about their products and services on their websites and mobile-optimized websites.


• | Questions & Answers. Allows our clients to facilitate question and answer conversations between consumers, or between consumers and brand representatives, on their websites.


• | Seller Ratings. Provides clients the ability to solicit and collect reviews about their company. Seller ratings are based on reviews about customers’ online experiences with the client’s company. Seller Reviews are collected by us on behalf of the client via e-mail solicitation. Once submitted, the Seller Reviews are displayed on our public-facing website as well as third-party sites and can also be syndicated to the clients’ website.


• | Workbench Analytics. Provides basic analytics capabilities that allow our clients to generate reports highlighting simple ratings trends, text analysis and product and service issue identification. Workbench Analytics also allows clients to perform self-service administration.

Bazaarvoice Curations
Allows our clients to pull in content from across a wide variety of social platforms, including Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Clients can then organize and display photos, videos, text and links that leverage social content throughout their site.
Bazaarvoice Product Sampling
Allows brands and retailers to build their own branded community to engage their advocates to gain content and momentum for new products, seasonal launches or across a portfolio.
Bazaarvoice Spotlights
 Provides our clients the opportunity to achieve substantially enhanced search results at the product category level by including consumer-generated content on their category pages, in addition to their product pages.
2) The Distribution and Monetization of Consumer-Generated Content Collected by Our Clients:
Bazaarvoice Connections Solutions
Our Conversations clients are connected through our SaaS platform to form a syndication network. We offer network syndication and brand engagement solutions to facilitate the distribution of online consumer-generated content among our clients and to enable brands to directly interact with consumers on our retail clients’ websites to influence purchase decisions wherever they may take place.

• | BrandAnswers As a key component of our Connections solution, BrandAnswers enables brands to interact directly with consumers on retail websites within our network to answer questions and provide suggestions on alternative products that may better meet that consumer’s needs. Brands gain visibility into all questions and answers about their products on retail websites that participate in our distribution relationships.


• | Review Response. Enables brands to interact with consumers by responding to reviews posted on retail websites within our network. Brands can strengthen their affinity with consumers by demonstrating that they are listening to and acting on consumer feedback gathered in the retail channel.

Bazaarvoice Advertising
By leveraging shopper data in our network, our advertising platform enables our brands and retailers to place digital advertising directly to in-market shoppers, based on their behavior in reading reviews, interacting with product data pages and searching category pages. 
5

Key products and features of our Advertising platform include:

• | Shopper Segments. We develop shopper profiles and sell targeted sets of shoppers to brand marketing departments, shopper marketing agencies and media agencies so they can effectively reach consumers while they are in the shopping environment.


• | Word of Mouth Advertisements. Provides brands with the ability to increase engagement with their advertising through the inclusion of authentic consumer sentiment. These “word of mouth” ad units can be used both on the Bazaarvoice Advertising network and throughout the web to create advertisements that are trusted, relevant and targeted.


• | Mobile Advertising. Bazaarvoice’s Advertising solution enables brands to reach consumers on their mobile devices.


• | Retail Site Monetization. Bazaarvoice Advertising has partnerships with major retail digital sites (desktop & mobile) to market to in-market shoppers on their behalf.

Bazaarvoice Professional and Managed Services
We offer a wide variety of services to help clients grow and expand their content programs, as well as understand best practice techniques and strategies to fully leverage our platforms and solutions.
Our Growth Strategy
The following are key elements of our growth strategy:
Grow our global client base and further penetrate industry verticals.
We believe that our platforms provide significant value for retailers and brands of all sizes. As a result, we expect to continue to add new accounts globally and expand our network. Moreover, we plan to further penetrate our current industry verticals and expand into additional verticals as we believe they can benefit from utilizing our platform to better understand consumers.
Increase brand penetration and sell new solutions to our existing clients.
We believe that we have a significant opportunity to build on relationships with existing clients, including some of the leading companies in the world. Many of our clients sell products through numerous distinct brands, both domestically and internationally. We have the opportunity to expand our relationship with these clients by deploying our solutions for some or all of their other brands.
Most of our clients use only a subset of the solutions available in our platforms. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to sell other solutions, including current and planned advertising offerings, to our existing clients as well as to new clients.
Increase the value of our network as a monetization tool for clients and grow the volume and variety of content across it to help clients derive greater consumer insights.
We believe we have a significant opportunity to accelerate the syndication of content across our network and increase the quantity and value of our shopper data profiles, which can provide significant monetization opportunities for our clients by utilizing our advertising and personalization solutions.
We plan to continue to aggregate an increasing volume and variety of online consumer-generated content and other relevant data across our network. In turn, we expect that consumers will have access to a greater amount of relevant online consumer-generated content to inform their purchase decisions anywhere, including in-store and mobile. We plan to enhance our clients’ ability to analyze the aggregated data by introducing new analytics capabilities to help our clients derive meaningful insights from shopper data across our network. We also intend to help our clients act on these unique shopping insights with highly targeted marketing and advertising solutions in the future.
Continue to make investments to improve client satisfaction and broaden our platform's capabilities through innovation.
We plan to continue to make investments into our worldwide client services in an effort to improve the quality of our client’s experience with our solutions and thus continue to improve client retention. We believe that our ability to retain our active SaaS clients and expand their use of our solutions over time is an indicator of the long-term value of our client relationships.
We view investments in research and development to be an integral part of our strategy. Our research and development efforts are principally focused on improving our software architecture to make our development efforts more efficient and cost-effective and adding new solutions to our platform to enhance our value proposition to existing and prospective clients. We are also developing new solutions that will enable us and our clients to more effectively leverage our network reach and the data we collect.

Pursue selective acquisitions and commercial relationships.
We may pursue selective acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies that will enable us to acquire targeted product and technology capabilities. From time to time, we also may enter into commercial relationships with internet and social media businesses if we believe this will benefit our clients.
Our Clients
We define an active SaaS client as an organization with which we have an annual, or longer, contract to provide one or more of our hosted social commerce solutions pursuant to which we are recognizing revenue as of the last day of the quarter, and we count organizations that are closely related as one active SaaS client, even if they have signed separate contractual agreements. We believe that our ability to increase our active SaaS client base is a leading indicator of our ability to grow revenue.
Due to the presentation of the PowerReviews business as discontinued operations, the number of active SaaS clients we disclose are from continuing operations only. As a result, our disclosure of active SaaS clients could include a common client for which we recognized recurring revenue who has organizations that have separate contractual agreements.
As of April 30, 2017, we served 1,494 active SaaS clients from continuing operations, including clients in the retail, consumer products, travel and leisure, technology, telecommunications, financial services, healthcare and automotive industries. No single client represented more than 10.0% of our revenue for the year ended April 30, 2017.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions through our direct sales team located globally in the markets we serve. Our sales cycle time can vary substantially from client to client but typically requires three to 12 months, although advertising sales cycles can be faster than SaaS sales cycles. In addition to focusing on new client sales, our sales teams are also focused on selling additional solutions to our existing clients.
Our marketing efforts are intended to build awareness, support lead generation, provide sales support, and penetrate new markets. Our marketing efforts include:


• | participation in, and sponsorship of, user conferences, trade shows, and industry events;


• | online marketing activities, including social advertising, search engine marketing, search engine optimization, webinars, email campaigns, our company website, and our Bazaarvoice Blog;


• | corporate communications activities including proactive and reactive media relations, analyst relations, social media, executive speaking engagements, customer reference program, and awards;


• | informational resources development to educate prospective clients on the evolving nature of marketing and business, including white papers, client case studies, and in-person demonstrations;


• | activities designed to increase client engagement and provide opportunities for additional upsell;


• | sales resources development; and


• | industry partnership and business development programs.

We host a number of sales and marketing events with current and prospective clients and opinion leaders for training, solutions demonstrations, and best practice sharing. These have included but aren’t limited to regional user group events, client dinners, industry event participation, SXSW panels and promotions and the Bazaarvoice Summit, an event for current and prospective clients to share insights. 
Worldwide Client Services
Our Worldwide Client Services team is responsible for managing all client activity after clients purchase our solutions. With locations in the markets we serve, our team is divided into four broad functions:

• | Client Onboarding – strategic consultants, implementation project managers, implementation engineers and user interface designers responsible for the solution design, implementation, and launch of Bazaarvoice solutions on clients’ websites;


• | Client Success – a team of client success professionals who provide consulting, account management, and support for program best practices and strategic success plans to drive tangible business results in a scalable manner. The Client Success team leads the renewals of our clients’ agreements with us;


• | Client Support – consists of support professionals who provide generalized client support for a variety of issues as well as the more traditional technical support services to diagnose and correct technical issues, deliver new production releases and respond to configuration change requests for our clients; and


• | User Generated Content Services – content moderators who review and moderate user generated review content across multiple languages and authenticity analysts who use internet forensics techniques to detect fraudulent reviews and validate authentic reviews.

Our enterprise license agreements with our clients include software updates and specific levels of onboarding, and client retention/renewal services. However, under these license agreements, major functional updates or enhancements may, at our discretion, be considered new solutions that will be made available to our clients at an additional charge.
Research and Development
Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, maintenance and operation of our technology solutions. Our research and development process emphasizes frequent, iterative and incremental development cycles, enabling us to incorporate client feedback while maintaining a high standard of quality. Within the research and development team, we have several highly aligned, independent sub-teams that focus on particular capabilities of our solutions. Each of these sub-teams includes product managers, designers, developers and quality assurance engineers responsible for the initial and ongoing development of their solution capability. In addition, the research and development team includes our production operations team, which is responsible for platform uptime.
We believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to the future success of our business. Historically, we have made substantial investments in research and development, and we plan to continue doing so in order to further differentiate ourselves from our competitors. In addition, we augment our full-time research and development staff with offshore third-party contractors located in Ukraine and India. Our research and development expenses were $40.1 million, $41.5 million and $37.7 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Competition
The market for social commerce solutions is highly competitive. The competitive dynamics of our market are unpredictable because it is rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to potential disruption by new technological innovations.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:


• | product breadth and functionality;


• | scope, quality and breadth of client base;


• | amount and quality of content;


• | service;


• | price;


• | reputation; and


• | operating model efficiency.

We believe that we compete favorably on the factors described above. We compete primarily against traditional marketing and advertising programs. Many businesses remain hesitant to embrace social commerce solutions, such as ratings and reviews, driven by their reluctance to display negative reviews about their brands, products or services or about other brands displayed on their websites. Additionally, some businesses have developed, or may develop in the future, social commerce solutions internally. These businesses may consider their internal solutions adequate, even if our solutions are superior.
We have several direct and indirect competitors across the regions we serve that provide third-party social commerce solutions, including but not limited to companies such as PowerReviews, Sprnklr, Turn To, Reevoo, eKomi, Yotpo, Rating System and Gigya. As a result of our divestiture of the PowerReviews business and the court-ordered terms associated with that divestiture, our competition with PowerReviews has increased. Additionally, we face potential competition from participants in adjacent markets that may enter our markets by leveraging related technologies and partnering with other companies.
We may also face competition from companies entering our market, including large Internet companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook, which could expand their platforms or acquire one or more of our competitors. While these companies do not currently focus on our market, they have significantly greater financial resources and, in the case of Amazon and Google, a longer operating history. They may be able to devote greater resources to the development and improvement of their services than we can and, as a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to technological changes and clients’ changing needs. Because our market is changing rapidly, it is possible that new entrants, especially those with substantial resources, more efficient operating models, more rapid product development cycles or lower marketing costs, could introduce new solutions that disrupt the manner in which businesses use online consumer-generated content and engage with consumers online to address the needs of our clients and potential clients. Our business and operating results could be harmed if any such disruption occurs.
We cannot be certain that these competitors, both current and potential, will not offer or develop services that are considered superior to ours or that services other than ours will attain greater market acceptance.

Our Culture
We consider our people and our culture to be a key differentiator for Bazaarvoice. As such, we invest in our people to drive high performance throughout the organization. We focus on communicating to build engagement and alignment around our strategy; creating a unique and competitive culture; attracting and hiring top talent; developing key capabilities around sales, services, R&D and leadership; and rewarding and recognizing high performance.
In particular, our culture gives us a competitive advantage in recruiting and retaining talent and is built upon the following fundamental beliefs:


• | We believe in delighting our customers – we are passionate about making a difference for our clients – among which are some of the most influential customers on the planet;


• | We believe in doing what matters – we have a mission that inspires and gives us purpose;


• | We believe in our seven values – performance, passion, innovation, authenticity, respect, teamwork and generosity; and


• | We believe in the power of people coming together – we are stronger and smarter together.

Technology Infrastructure & Operations
We have invested extensively in developing our proprietary technology infrastructure to support the growth of our business. Our proprietary technology infrastructure includes a third-party data center, cloud computing and network management, a secure centralized source control management system and proprietary data analytics.
Maintaining the integrity and security of our technology infrastructure is critical to our ability to provide online consumer-generated content, and we have a dedicated security team that promotes industry best practices and drives compliance with data security standards. We use encryption technologies and certificates for secure transmission of personal information between consumers and our solutions.
Our technology infrastructure has the ability to handle sudden bursts of activity for users over a short period of time with high levels of performance and reliability. We operate at a scale that routinely delivers more than 600 million consumer-generated content (“CGC”) impressions per day with peak activity of over 2 billion impressions per day.
Key elements of our technology infrastructure are described below.


• | Scalable Infrastructure. Our physical network infrastructure utilizes multiple hosted and cloud data centers linked with a high speed virtual private network. We utilize commodity hardware together with cloud infrastructure, and our architecture is designed for high availability and fault tolerance while accommodating the demands of our service utilization.


• | Cloud Computing Innovation. We have developed our architecture to work effectively in a flexible cloud environment that has a high degree of automated elasticity together with high levels of availability.

Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property includes our patent applications, registered and unregistered trademarks and registered domain names. We believe that our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business and that our technology infrastructure currently gives us a competitive advantage. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and the European Union, as well as contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and assets. We currently have trademarks registered in the United States for our name and certain of the words and phrases that we use in our business. We also rely on copyright laws to protect software relating to our websites and our proprietary technologies, although we have not yet registered for copyright protection. We have registered numerous Internet domain names related to our business in order to protect our proprietary interests. As of April 30, 2017, we had 14 issued U.S. patents and 8 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner.
The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. Third-parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts, other parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our websites without authorization. We may be unable to prevent competitors from acquiring domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon or diminish the value of our domain names, trademarks, service marks and our other proprietary rights. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our solutions. Failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could significantly harm our competitive position and operating results.
In addition, we license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our solutions. Licenses of third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us at a commercially reasonable cost or at all.

Companies in the internet and technology industries, and other patent, copyright and trademark holders own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently threaten or enter into litigation based on claims of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, notices that claim we have misappropriated or misused other parties’ intellectual property rights. There may be intellectual property rights held by others, including issued or pending patents, copyrights and trademarks, that cover significant aspects of our technologies, content, branding or business methods. Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management’s attention and other resources. These claims also could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using technology, content, branding or business methods found to be in violation of another party’s rights. We might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding or business methods, which could require significant effort and expense and make us less competitive in the social commerce market. If we cannot license or develop technology, content, branding or business methods for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively.
Employees
As of April 30, 2017, we had 763 full-time employees. We also engage a number of independent contractors and consultants. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or is a party to a collective bargaining agreement.
Information about Segment and Geographic Revenue
Information about segment and geographic revenue is set forth in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8: “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Corporate Information
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 2005. Our principal executive offices are located at 10901 Stonelake Blvd, Austin, TX 78759, and our telephone number is (512) 551-6000. Our corporate website address is www.bazaarvoice.com. In addition to the information about us and our subsidiaries contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, information about us can be found on our website including information on our corporate governance principles. Our website and information contained on or accessible through our website are not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not incorporate the information contained on, or accessible through, our website into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We completed our initial public offering in February 2012 and our common stock is listed on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (“NASDAQ”) Global Select Market under the symbol “BV.” Unless the context requires otherwise, the words “Bazaarvoice,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Bazaarvoice, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
On June 12, 2012, we acquired PowerReviews, Inc. (“PowerReviews”), a provider of social commerce solutions, for a total cash and stock purchase price of $150.8 million. On January 8, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division (the “Court”) ruled, in connection with a complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), that our acquisition of PowerReviews violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 18. Under the terms of a Joint Stipulation with the DOJ (the "Joint Stipulation") and an Order to the Court, on June 4, 2014, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest all of the assets of PowerReviews, LLC, the successor to PowerReviews, to Wavetable Labs, LLC (“Wavetable”), which subsequently changed its name to PowerReviews, for $30.0 million in cash, $4.5 million which was held in escrow and subsequently released in fiscal 2016. As a result of the foregoing, PowerReviews revenues, related expenses and loss on disposal, net of tax, are components of “loss from discontinued operations, net of tax” in the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented. On the consolidated balance sheets, the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations of PowerReviews have been presented as ‘Assets held for sale’ and ‘Liabilities held for sale,’ respectively, as of April 30, 2014. The statement of cash flows is reported on a combined basis without separately presenting cash flows from discontinued operations. The discussion of our results of operations is based upon the results from our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated.
