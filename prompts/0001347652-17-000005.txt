ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. (“CorEnergy”) was organized as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations on December 8, 2005. As used in this report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and the “Company” refer to CorEnergy and its subsidiaries. Please refer to the Glossary of Defined Terms presented at the beginning of Part 1 for definitions of additional capitalized terms and abbreviations used in this report. Prior to 2011 we operated as a business development company under the name Tortoise Capital Resources Corporation and invested primarily in securities of privately held and micro-cap public companies operating in the U.S. energy sector. In April 2011, we withdrew our election to be treated as a business development company. We do not plan on making additional investments in securities (other than short-term, highly liquid investments to be held pending acquisition of real property assets and, in certain cases, equity securities related to an underlying real property investments) and intend to liquidate our legacy private securities investments in an orderly manner. We elected REIT status for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with calendar year 2013. Our REIT election, assuming continuing compliance with the then applicable qualification tests, will continue in effect for subsequent taxable years. 
COMPANY OVERVIEW
CorEnergy primarily owns assets in the U.S. energy sector that perform utility-like functions, such as pipelines, storage terminals, rail terminals and gas and electric transmission and distribution assets. Our objective is to provide shareholders with a stable and growing cash dividend, supported by long-term contracted revenue from operators of our assets, primarily under triple-net participating leases. These leases generate stable cash flows without direct commodity price exposure. We believe our leadership team’s energy and utility expertise provides CorEnergy with a competitive advantage to acquire, own and lease U.S. energy infrastructure assets in a tax-efficient, transparent, investor-friendly REIT. We meet the capital needs of companies in the U.S. energy infrastructure sector because we are a passive, long-term partner using our management's extensive industry knowledge to customize our long-term leases and structured financings. Our leadership team also has extensive insight on the broad universe of assets that may be owned by a REIT and utilizes a disciplined investment philosophy developed through an average of over 24 years of relevant industry experience.
We expect our leases to provide us with contracted base rent, plus participating rent based upon asset-specific criteria. The energy industry commonly employs contracts with participating features, and we provide exposure to both the risk and opportunity of utilization of our assets, which we believe is a hallmark of infrastructure assets of all types. Our participating triple-net leases require the operator to pay all expenses of the business including maintaining our assets in good working order. 
The majority of our assets leased to tenants under triple-net leases are dependent upon the tenants' exploitation of hydrocarbon reserves in the fields where our assets are located. These reserves are depleted over time, and therefore, may economically diminish the value of our assets over the period that the underlying reserves are exploited. Accordingly, we expect the contracted base rents under these leases, including fair market renewal rent expectations, to provide for a return on capital, as well as a return of capital, over the life of the asset. The portion of rents we believe to constitute return of capital are utilized for debt repayment and/or are reserved for capital reinvestment activities in order to maintain the Company’s long-term earnings and dividend paying capacity. The return on capital is that portion of rents which are available for distribution to our shareholders through dividend payouts.
Base rents under our leases are structured on an estimated fair market value rent structure over the initial term, which includes assumptions related to the terminal value of our assets and expectations of tenant renewals. At the conclusion of the initial lease term, our leases generally contain fair market value repurchase options or fair market rent renewal terms. These clauses also act as safeguards against our tenants pursuing activities which would undermine or degrade the value of our assets faster than the underlying reserves are depleted. Our participating rents are structured to provide exposure to the commercial activity of the tenant, and as such, also provide protection in the event that the economic life of our assets is reduced based on accelerated production by our tenants.
Our assets are primarily mission-critical to our customers, in that utilization of our assets is necessary for the business they seek to conduct and their rental payments are an essential operating expense. For example, our crude oil gathering system assets are necessary to the exploitation of upstream crude oil reserves, so the operators' lease of those assets is economically critical to their operations. Some of our assets are subject to rate regulation by FERC or state public utility commissions. Further, energy infrastructure assets are an essential and growing component of the U.S. economy that give us the opportunity to assist the capital expansion plans and meet the capital needs of various midstream and upstream participants.
We intend to distribute substantially all of our cash available for distribution, less prudent reserves, on a quarterly basis. CorEnergy targets dividend growth of 1-3% annually from existing contracts through inflation escalations and participating rents and additional growth from acquisitions. Based on low inflation and current production levels, the Company is not anticipating significant inflation-based or participating rents in 2017. Since qualifying as a REIT in 2013, we have grown our annualized dividend from $2.50 per

share to $3.00 per share. Our management contract includes incentive provisions, aligning our leadership team with our stockholders' interests in raising the dividend only if we believe the rate is sustainable.
2016 Highlights
2016 proved to be a challenging year in the energy industry, largely driven by volatility in commodity prices. This resulted in a number of North American oil and gas producers filing for bankruptcy protection during the year, including the parent companies of two of our lease tenants. Our 2016 year was highlighted by enduring these bankruptcy proceedings while our tenants remained current on their monthly rents. These and other key transactions and events during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, as well as subsequent to year end but prior to the filing of this report, are highlighted below:
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016

• | In January 2016, the Department of Defense awarded Omega Pipeline Company, LLC a new, 10-year agreement with very similar terms and conditions as the previous agreements to continue providing natural gas and gas distribution services through January 31, 2026.


• | On March 30, 2016, we refinanced our share of the Pinedale Credit Facility using funds drawn from the CorEnergy Revolver.


• | On April 1, 2016, we received the final $1.4 million distribution from escrow, related to the November 2014 sale of VantaCore.


• | During May 2016, we repurchased a total of $1 million of the Convertible Notes in the open market.


• | On June 16, 2016, we sold substantially all of the foreclosed assets of Black Bison Water Services and its subsidiaries to Expedition Water Solutions for a combination of $1 million in cash plus an earn-out of up to $6.5 million in royalty payments.


• | During the second quarter of 2016, we repurchased 90,613 common shares for a total of $2 million.


• | Effective October 1, 2016, a portion of the Four Wood Financing Notes with SWD Enterprises was restructured.


• | On November 28, 2016, the US Bankruptcy Court approved Ultra Petroleum's assumption of the Pinedale LGS Lease Agreement with no economic changes. Ultra Petroleum declared bankruptcy in April 2016 and has remained timely on its rent payments throughout the bankruptcy proceedings. 


• | On December 30, 2016, Energy XXI announced that it had completed its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the US Bankrputcy Code with the succeeding company named Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc. This followed the declaration of bankruptcy in April 2016. Our tenant of the Grand Isle Gathering System remained outside the bankruptcy process and continued to make timely rent payments throughout the bankruptcy proceedings. 

Significant 2017 Developments

• | Effective March 1, 2017, MoGas entered into a long-term firm transportation services agreement with its largest customer, Laclede Gas Company ("Laclede"). The agreement, which amends a prior agreement, extends the termination date for Laclede's existing firm transportation services agreement from October 31, 2017 to October 31, 2030. Tariff rates under the extended agreement will be discounted beginning on November 1, 2018.

Energy Infrastructure Financing Investments
We have provided financing loans to owners and operators of energy infrastructure real property assets, secured by such assets and related equipment, as well as by the outstanding equity of the borrowers. These loans include participating features pursuant to which we may receive additional interest tied to increases in utilization of the underlying facilities, and one also includes an equity enhancement. See the section titled "Asset Portfolio and Related Developments" in Item 7 and Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement included in this report for additional information concerning these investments.
Private Equity Investments
Our legacy private equity investments generally have been liquidated in accordance with the plans of those entities. For additional information, see “Private Security Assets” under Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K.
Acquisition Strategies and Due Diligence
We generally rely on our own analysis to determine whether to make an acquisition. In evaluating net lease transactions, we generally consider, among other things, the following aspects of each transaction:

• | Tenant/Borrower Evaluation – We evaluate each potential tenant or borrower for its creditworthiness, typically considering factors such as management experience, industry position and fundamentals, operating history, and capital structure, as well as other factors that may be relevant to a particular acquisition. We seek opportunities in which we believe the tenant may have a stable or improving credit profile or credit potential that has not been recognized by the market. In evaluating a possible investment, the creditworthiness of a tenant or borrower often will be balanced with the value of the underlying real estate, particularly if the underlying property is specifically suited to the needs of the tenant. Whether a prospective tenant or borrower is creditworthy will be determined by our management team and reviewed by the investment committee, as described below. Creditworthy does not necessarily mean “investment grade.” 


• | Importance to Tenant/Borrower Operations – We generally will focus on properties that we believe are essential or important to the ongoing operations of the tenant. We believe that this type of property will provide a relatively low risk of loss in the case of a potential bankruptcy or abandonment scenario since a tenant/borrower is less likely to risk the loss of a critically important lease or property. Additionally we focus on assets which are necessary for the economic production of hydrocarbon resources, and which would remain necessary to any owner of the assets. 


• | Diversification – We attempt to diversify our portfolio to avoid dependence on any one particular tenant, borrower, collateral type, and geographic location within the U.S. or tenant/borrower industry. By diversifying, we seek to reduce the adverse effect of a single under-performing investment or a downturn in any particular asset or geographic region within the U.S. 


• | Lease Terms – Generally, the net leased properties we will acquire will be leased on a full recourse basis to the tenants or their affiliates. In addition, we generally will seek to include a clause in each lease that provides for increases in rent over the term of the lease. These increases are fixed or tied generally to increases in indices such as the CPI. The lease will also generally seek to provide for participation in gross revenues of the tenant at the property, thereby providing exposure to the commercial activity of the tenant. Alternatively, a lease may provide for mandated rental increases on specific dates, and we may adopt other methods in the future. 


• | Asset Evaluation – We review the physical condition of the property and assess the likelihood of replacing the rental payment stream if the tenant defaults. We also generally engage a third party to conduct, or require the seller to conduct a preliminary examination, or Phase 1 assessment, of the site to determine the potential for contamination or similar environmental site assessments in an attempt to identify potential environmental liabilities associated with a property prior to its acquisition. 


• | Transaction Provisions to Enhance and Protect Value – We attempt to include provisions in the leases that we believe may help protect a real property asset from changes in the operating and financial characteristics of a tenant that may

9


Index to Financial Statements | Glossary of Defined Terms

affect its ability to satisfy its obligations or reduce the value of the real property asset. Such provisions include requiring our consent to specified tenant activity, requiring the tenant to provide indemnification protections, and requiring the tenant to utilize good operating practices consistent with objective criteria. We seek to enhance the likelihood of a tenant’s lease obligations being satisfied through a guaranty of obligations from the tenant’s corporate parent or other entity or a letter of credit. In addition, in some circumstances, we may provide tenants with repurchase options on the leased property. We expect, in those situations that the option purchase price will generally be the greater of the contract purchase price or the fair market value of the property at the time the option is exercised.

• | Equity Enhancements – We may attempt to obtain equity enhancements in connection with transactions. These equity enhancements may involve warrants exercisable at a future time to purchase stock of the tenant or borrower or their parent. If warrants are obtained, and become exercisable, and if the value of the stock subsequently exceeds the exercise price of the warrant, equity enhancements can help achieve the goal of increasing investor returns. 


• | Other Real Estate Related Assets – As other opportunities arise, we may also seek to expand the portfolio to include other types of real estate-related investments, in all cases within the energy infrastructure sector, such as:


• | equity investments in real properties that are not long-term net leased to a single-tenant and may include partially leased properties, undeveloped properties and properties subject to short-term net leases, among others;


• | mortgage loans secured by real properties including loans to our taxable REIT subsidiaries;


• | subordinated interests in first mortgage real estate loans, or B-notes;


• | mezzanine loans related to real estate, which are senior to the borrower’s equity position but subordinated to other third-party financing; and


• | equity and debt securities (including preferred equity, limited partnership interests, trusts and other higher-yielding structured debt and equity investments) issued by companies that are engaged in real-estate-related businesses as defined by regulations promulgated under the Code, including other REITs.

Use of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries
We operate as a REIT and therefore are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on the income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders, including the income derived through leasing fees and financing revenue from our REIT qualifying investment in energy infrastructure assets. However, even as a REIT, we remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our taxable REIT subsidiaries. The use of TRSs enables us to own certain assets and engage in certain businesses while maintaining compliance with the REIT qualification requirements under the Code. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries, and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our TRSs to other subsidiaries, including qualified REIT subsidiaries.
Regulatory and Environmental Matters
Our energy infrastructure assets and operations, as well as those of our tenants, are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of public health and safety, zoning and land use, and pricing and other matters related to certain of our business operations. For a discussion of the current effects and potential future impacts of such regulations on our business and properties, see the discussion presented in Item 1A of this report under the subheading “Risks Related to Our Investments in Real Estate and the U.S. Energy Infrastructure Sector." In particular, for a discussion of the current and potential future effects of compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations, see the discussion titled "Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our income and the cash available for distribution” within such section.
Financing Strategies
Consistent with our asset acquisition policies, we use leverage when available on terms we believe are favorable. The amount of leverage that we may employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. Although we currently do not anticipate doing so, the amount of total funded debt leverage we employ may exceed 50 percent of our total assets. Secured loans which we obtain, could be recourse or non-recourse to us. A lender on non-recourse mortgage debt generally has recourse only to the property collateralizing such debt and not to any of our other assets, while full recourse financing would give the lender recourse to all of our assets. The use of non-recourse debt, helps us to limit the exposure of all of our assets to any one debt obligation. Lenders may, however, have recourse to our other assets in limited circumstances not related to the repayment of the indebtedness, such as under an environmental indemnity. We may have an unsecured line of credit that can be used in connection with refinancing existing debt and making new acquisitions, as well as to meet other working capital needs. We intend to incur debt which bears interest at fixed rates, or is effectively converted to fixed rates through interest rate caps or swap agreements.

Competition
We compete with public and private funds, commercial and investment banks and commercial financing companies to make the types of investments that we plan to make in the U.S. energy infrastructure sector. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to a greater variety of funding sources than are available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, allowing them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. These competitive conditions may adversely affect our ability to make investments in the energy infrastructure sector and could adversely affect our distributions to stockholders.
RECENT TRANSACTIONS
Effective March 1, 2017, MoGas, entered in to a long-term firm transportation services agreement with Laclede, its largest customer. The agreement, which amends a prior agreement, extends the termination date for Laclede’s existing firm transportation agreement from October 31, 2017 to October 31, 2030. During the entire extended term, Laclede will continue to reserve 62,800 dekatherms per day of firm transportation capacity on MoGas. This service will continue at the full tariff rate of $12.385 per dekatherm per month until October 31, 2018, at which time the rate will be reduced to $6.386 per dekatherm per month for the remainder of the agreement. 
The amended contract was negotiated in response to changing market conditions affecting the midcontinent gas supply. In January 2017, the Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (“REX”) announced the completion of its pipeline capacity enhancement project, which allows it to flow less expensive natural gas from the Appalachian Basin westward to its Zone 3 delivery points in western Illinois and eastern Missouri. This development, plus additional pipeline and basin developments, has caused gas companies, including MoGas shippers, to consider sourcing supply from REX and the East Coast in place of Rocky Mountain supply. MoGas has a number of opportunities to offset the reduction in revenue from Laclede, including potential pipeline extensions, leveraging its multiple pipeline connections, exploring different supply basin optionality, and other revenue enhancement strategies. Prior to the November 1, 2018 effective date of the reduced rate with Laclede, MoGas intends to act upon several of these prospects and the Company believes that through a combination of these opportunities, it will be able to significantly offset the reduction in revenues from Laclede in 2019 and beyond.
MANAGEMENT
Our Manager
We are externally managed by Corridor. Corridor is a real property asset manager with a focus on U.S. energy infrastructure real property assets. Corridor assists us in identifying infrastructure real property asset acquisition opportunities, and is generally responsible for our day-to-day operations. 
Corridor Team
Each of our officers is an employee of Corridor or one of its affiliates. Corridor is not obligated to dedicate certain of its employees exclusively to us, nor are it or its employees obligated to dedicate any specific portion of its or their time to our business. As described below, we pay a management fee and certain other fees to Corridor, which it uses in part to pay compensation to its officers and employees who, notwithstanding that some of them also are our officers, receive no cash compensation directly from us.
We pay Corridor a management fee based on total assets under management. Additionally, in aligning our strategy to focus on distributions and distribution growth, Corridor is paid an incentive fee based on increases in distributions to our stockholders. A percentage of the Corridor incentive fee is reinvested in CorEnergy's common stock. Pursuant to a Management Agreement and an Administrative Agreement, Corridor has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to present us with suitable acquisition opportunities consistent with our investment objectives and policies and is generally responsible, subject to the supervision and review of our Board of Directors, for our day-to-day operations.
Energy Infrastructure Real Property Asset Management
The Corridor team has experience across several segments of the energy sector and is primarily responsible for investigating, analyzing and selecting potential infrastructure asset acquisition opportunities. Acquisitions and transactions are submitted to our Board of Directors for final approval following a recommendation from the management team.
We believe that effective management of our assets is essential to maintain and enhance property values. Important aspects of asset management include restructuring transactions to meet the evolving needs of current tenants, re-leasing properties, refinancing debt, selling properties and knowledge of the bankruptcy process.

We monitor, on an ongoing basis, compliance by tenants with their lease obligations and other factors that could affect the financial performance of any of our properties. Monitoring involves receiving assurances that each tenant has paid real estate taxes, assessments and other expenses relating to the properties it occupies and confirming that appropriate insurance coverage is being maintained by the tenant. We review financial statements of tenants and undertake regular physical inspections of the condition and maintenance of properties. In addition, we periodically analyze each tenant’s financial condition and the industry in which each tenant operates.
Private Investment Monitoring
We monitor our private investments to determine progress relative to meeting the Company’s business plan and to assess the Company’s strategic and tactical courses of action. This monitoring is accomplished by attendance at Board of Directors meetings, ad hoc communications with portfolio company management, the review of periodic operating and financial reports, an analysis of relevant reserve information and capital expenditure plans, and periodic consultations with engineers, geologists, and other experts. The performance of each private portfolio company is also periodically compared to performance of similarly sized companies with comparable assets and businesses to assess performance relative to peers. Corridor’s monitoring activities are expected to provide us with information that will enable us to monitor compliance with existing covenants.
Management Agreement
Under our Management Agreement, Corridor (i) presents the Company with suitable acquisition opportunities consistent with the investment policies and objectives of the Company, (ii) is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Company, and (iii) performs such services and activities relating to the assets and operations of the Company as may be appropriate. The Management Agreement does not have a specific term, and will remain in place unless terminated by the Company or the Manager in the manner permitted pursuant to the agreement. 
The terms of the Management Agreement include a quarterly management fee equal to 0.25 percent (1.00 percent annualized) of the value of the Company’s Managed Assets as of the end of each quarter. For purposes of the Management Agreement, “Managed Assets” means the total assets of the Company (including any securities receivables, other personal property or real property purchased with or attributable to any borrowed funds) minus (A) the initial invested value of all non-controlling interests, (B) the value of any hedged derivative assets, (C) any prepaid expenses, and (D) all of the accrued liabilities other than (1) deferred taxes and (2) debt entered into for the purpose of leverage. For purposes of the definition of Managed Assets, the Company’s securities portfolio will be valued at then-current market value. For purposes of the definition of Managed Assets, other personal property and real property assets will include real and other personal property owned and the assets of the Company invested, directly or indirectly, in equity interests in or loans secured by real estate or personal property (including acquisition-related costs and acquisition costs that may be allocated to intangibles or are unallocated), valued at the aggregate historical cost, before reserves for depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or bad debts or other similar noncash reserves.
The Management Agreement includes a quarterly incentive fee of 10 percent of the increase in distributions paid over a threshold distribution equal to $0.625 per share per quarter. The Management Agreement also requires at least half of any incentive fees to be reinvested in the Company’s common stock. 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company and the Manager agreed to the following modifications to the fee arrangements described above:

• | In light of the provisions for loan losses recognized by the Company on certain of its energy infrastructure financing investments (collectively, the "Underperforming Loans") during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, the Manager voluntarily recommended, and the Company agreed, that effective on and after the Company's March 31, 2016 balance sheet date, solely for the purpose of computing the value of the Company’s Managed Assets in calculating the quarterly management fee under the terms of the Management Agreement, that portion of the Management Fee attributable to the Company’s investment in the Underperforming Loans would be based on the estimated net realizable value of such loans, not to exceed the amount invested in the Underperforming Loans as of the end of the quarter for which the Management Fee is calculated. This agreement superseded a prior agreement between the Company and the Manager, which was effective as of September 30, 2015, concerning valuation of the Black Bison Loans for purposes of calculating the Management Fee.


• | The Manager voluntarily recommended, and the Company agreed, that the Manager would waive $88 thousand of the $595 thousand total quarterly incentive fees that would otherwise have been payable under the provisions described above with respect to dividends paid on the Company's common stock during the year ended December 31, 2016, and accordingly the Manager received an incentive fee of $507 thousand during the year.
