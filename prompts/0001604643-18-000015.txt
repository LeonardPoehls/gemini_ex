Company Overview
Evoqua Water Technologies is a leading provider of mission critical water treatment solutions, offering services, systems and technologies to support our customers’ full water lifecycle needs. With over 200,000 installations worldwide, we hold leading positions in the industrial, commercial and municipal water treatment markets in North America. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of differentiated, proprietary technology solutions sold under a number of market-leading and well-established brands. We deliver and maintain these mission critical solutions through the largest service network in North America, assuring our customers continuous uptime with 87 branches as of September 30, 2018. We have an extensive service and support network, and as a result, a certified Evoqua Service Technician is no more than a two hour drive from more than 90% of our customers’ sites. 
Our solutions are designed to ensure that our customers have access to an uninterrupted quantity and level of quality of water that meets their unique product, process and recycle or reuse specifications. We enable our customers to achieve lower costs through greater uptime, throughput and efficiency in their operations and support their regulatory compliance and environmental sustainability. We have worked to protect water, the environment and our employees for over 100 years. As a result, we have earned a reputation for quality, safety and reliability and are sought out by our customers to solve the full range of their water treatment needs, and maintaining our reputation is critical to the success of our business.
We provide solutions across the entire water cycle. The water cycle begins with “influent” water, which is sourced from oceans, rivers, lakes, as well as other sources. We treat the influent water so that it can be used for a wide variety of industrial, commercial and municipal applications. In industrial applications, influent water, after it is treated, is used as process water for applications, such as microelectronic production, as an ingredient in the production of food and beverage 
3

and other goods and in utility applications including boiler feed water, cooling water and steam condensate. Commercial applications for influent water include laboratory testing and aquatic activities, while municipal applications for influent water include treatment to produce safe drinking water and wastewater that is compliant with applicable regulations. After the water is used it is considered “effluent water,” and we enable its treatment through the removal of impurities so that it can be discharged safely back into the environment or reused for industrial, commercial or municipal applications.
We have developed a broad set of well established, unique relationships across a highly diverse customer base. In the industrial market we serve over 25,000 customers, including a substantial majority of the industrial companies within the Fortune 500. We partner with our industrial customers through our direct sales and service team, which is organized geographically and by specific end market. In the municipal market we serve over 7,800 U.S. wastewater sites and over 1,800 global drinking water treatment sites, providing solutions that help treat over 40% of the U.S. municipal wastewater sites as of September 30, 2018. Our deep institutional relationships with independent sales representatives across North America, who serve as the primary channel for new municipal water treatment projects, and upon whom we depend to successfully market and sell our products, services and solutions provide us significant access to new projects up for bid and for servicing our installed base.
For the year ended September 30, 2018, we generated 85% of our revenues in North America with a strong and growing international presence, and we currently employ approximately 4,000 individuals. For the year ended September 30, 2018, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.34 billion, $7.9 million and $216.9 million, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2017, we generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.25 billion, $6.4 million and $207.7 million, respectively. For more information on Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-How We Assess the Performance of Our Business-Adjusted EBITDA.”
As depicted in the table below, we target attractive global end‑markets that utilize water as a critical part of their operations or production processes including pharmaceuticals and health sciences, microelectronics, food and beverage, hydrocarbon and chemical processing, power, general manufacturing, municipal drinking water and wastewater, marine and aquatics end markets. While a decline in general global and economic conditions could adversely affect us, our business 
4

is highly diversified across our key attractive and growing end markets presented below, and we believe that no single end market drives the overall results of our business.
Our Industry
We estimate the global water and wastewater market to represent more than $600 billion in total revenue and includes both capital and operating expenditures for the treatment and transportation of water by industrial, municipal, commercial and residential end users. Within the global water and wastewater market, we estimate our addressable market, comprised of equipment, consumables, aftermarket parts and operations‑related and maintenance‑related services for the treatment of water for industrial, commercial and municipal end users, to represent over $85 billion in total revenue. 
Our estimated addressable market is further refined to include our served market, which we estimate to be approximately $8.5 billion in the North American region and approximately $7.5 billion across Europe and the Asia Pacific region, totaling approximately $16 billion in total revenue. As compared to our larger addressable market, our served market excludes sectors that would require meaningful growth investment on our part to capture new customers or market opportunities.
While a decline in general global economic and business conditions may adversely affect demand for our products, services and solutions, we believe the global water market will continue to experience growth, supported by a variety of anticipated secular trends that will drive the demand for water across a multitude of industrial, commercial and municipal applications. These secular trends include global population growth, urbanization, industrialization and overall economic growth. In addition, the supply of clean water could be adversely impacted by factors including an aging water infrastructure within North America and increased levels of water stress from seasonal rainfall, inadequate water storage options or treatment technologies. More specific to our business, water is a critical component and byproduct of many processes, including in manufacturing and product development. As such, as global consumption patterns evolve and water shortages persist, demand for solutions and services will continue to increase. 
We hold leading positions in our North American market verticals that have been cultivated by our suite of differentiated solutions and our comprehensive service network. However, despite our leading position in many individual 
5

market verticals where we participate, these markets remain very fragmented, and we estimate that our market share was less than 25% in most market verticals in which we participated during 2018.
We serve three primary market verticals: (i) industrial, (ii) commercial and (iii) municipal. Industrial and commercial customers vary in size, scope and the complexity of their water treatment needs and include small manufacturing clients with a single facility, large commercial waterparks and multinational corporations with a significant global footprint. The municipal market consists of potable water and wastewater treatment solutions that are sold to municipalities and private companies operating under a concession agreement to own and operate treatment facilities on behalf of municipalities. We serve each market with a full range of solutions, services, technologies and aftermarket offerings.
Our Growth Strategy
The key elements of our strategy include:
Grow and further penetrate our existing customer base. We believe our strong brands, leading position in highly fragmented markets, scalable and global offerings, leading installed base and unique ability to provide complete treatment solutions will enable us to capture a larger share of our existing customers’ water treatment spend while expanding with existing and new customers into adjacent end‑markets and underpenetrated regions, including by investing in our sales force and cross‑selling to existing customers. Our growth initiatives include both expanding our presence in our core North American market as well as replicating our leading position and strategies into underpenetrated global regions. For example, through innovative technologies such as IONPURE continuous electrodeionization and Defender aquatic regenerative media filtration systems, we have expanded our positions in markets such as Asia and the Middle East.
Through direct and indirect sales efforts, outreach and education, we plan to continue to enhance our relationships and enable further adoption of our products, technologies and solutions by end customers and key influencers, including municipal representatives, engineering firms, designers and other system specifiers. Our performance depends, in part, on our ability to attract, incentivize and retain third party sales representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively, and competing for sales personnel with established customer relationships intense.
Continued transition of our customers to a higher value‑add service‑based business model. Our goal is to provide reliable water treatment solutions by combining our products and technologies with extensive service and distribution capabilities. We selectively target high value projects with opportunities for recurring business through service, parts and other aftermarket opportunities over the lifecycle of the process or capital equipment. In particular, we have developed internet‑connected monitoring technologies through the deployment of our Water One® service platform, which enables customers to outsource their water treatment systems and focus on their core business, offering customers system optimization, predictive and proactive service, and simplified billing and pricing. Our Water One® platform also enables us to transition our customers to pricing models based on usage, which otherwise would not have been possible without technological advancement. Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to develop or acquire new products, services and solutions, identify emerging technological trends in our target end markets and maintain the integrity of our information technology systems.
Drive margin expansion and cash flow improvements through continued focus on operational excellence and execution. Effective October 1, 2018, we restructured our business into two operating segments, which we expect to result in cost savings in the range of $15 million to $20 million on an annualized basis once fully implemented. We have separately identified and are pursuing a number of discrete initiatives which, if successful, we expect could result in additional cost savings over the next three years. These initiatives include our ePro and supply chain improvement program to consolidate and manage global spending, our improved logistics and transportation management program, further optimizing our engineering cost structure, and capturing benefits of our Water One® platform. Furthermore, as a result of significant investments we have made in our footprint and facilities, we believe we have capacity to support our planned growth without commensurate increases in fixed costs.
Commercialize and drive adoption of nascent and newly acquired technologies by leveraging our sales channels and application expertise. We offer a full range of services, systems and technologies that we continually develop to meet our customers’ evolving water lifecycle needs. We develop our technologies through in‑house research, development and 
6

engineering and targeted tuck‑in, vertical market and geography-expanding, technology‑enhancing acquisitions. We have a reservoir of recently launched technologies and a pipeline of new offerings designed to provide customers with innovative, value‑enhancing solutions. Furthermore, since April 2016, we have successfully completed twelve acquisitions that expand our vertical markets and geographic reach and enhance our technologies, strengthening our existing capabilities and adding new capabilities and cross selling opportunities in areas such as mobile wastewater treatment, soil and air treatment, regenerative media filtration, anodes, UV and ozone disinfection, aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment technologies and electrochemical and electrochlorination cells. We must continue to develop and acquire new products, services and solutions to successfully compete in our markets.
We believe a key differentiator for our technology development program is our strong record of incorporating new technologies into the comprehensive solutions we provide to our customers across our platform. We are able to rapidly scale new technologies using our leading direct and third‑party sales channels and our relationships with key influencers, including municipal representatives, engineering firms, designers and other system specifiers. Through our service network, we have a direct view of our customers’ water needs which allows us to focus on developing and acquiring the most relevant and sought‑after solutions.
We believe our continued investment in driving penetration of our recently launched technologies, robust pipeline of new capabilities and best‑in‑class channels to market will allow us to continue to address our customer needs across the water lifecycle.
Continue to evaluate and pursue accretive tuck‑in acquisitions to add new technologies, attractive geographic regions and end‑markets. As a complement to our organic growth initiatives, we view tuck‑in acquisitions as a key element of our overall growth strategy which will enable us to accelerate our growth in our current addressable market, new geographies and new end market verticals. Our existing customer relationships, channels to market and ability to rapidly commercialize technologies provide a strong platform to drive growth in the businesses we acquire. To capitalize on these opportunities we have built an experienced team dedicated to mergers and acquisitions that has, since April 2016, successfully completed twelve acquisitions that expand our vertical markets and geographic reach and enhance our technologies,  which we have typically financed through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. In 2018, we successfully closed four acquisitions: Pure Water Solutions, LLC, which supplements our existing high-purity water treatment business; Pacific Ozone Technology, Inc., which adds a complementary line of ozone disinfection products; ProAct Services Corporation, which expands our capabilities in on-site and mobile water treatment services; and Le Groupe IsH20Top Inc., which strengthens our high-purity water treatment capabilities in Canada. Although we may not continue to identify suitable acquisition targets and implement our growth strategy, we currently have a pipeline which includes more than 60 potential targets, which has been developed proactively by our team as well as informed by our customer base.

Industrial Segment
Our Industrial Segment provides application‑specific solutions and full lifecycle services for critical water applications. We focus on treating industrial process water, utility water and wastewater. Industrial process water requires specific purity standards, which are used in making goods in industries such as microelectronics, pharmaceuticals and health sciences and food and beverage, including ingredient water. Industrial utility water is used for critical industrial applications, including as boiler feed and cooling water. Industrial wastewater is effluent water discharged from plants or facilities which is treated before it is returned to the environment or recycled or reused within the water cycle. Our operations across the water cycle are complex and, if conducted improperly, may result in potential costs and liabilities, including as a result of environmental damage. Our comprehensive solutions are comprised of capital systems and related recurring aftermarket services, parts and consumables, along with long‑term and short‑term service contracts and emergency services. Our comprehensive capabilities range from discrete offerings to the provision of highly complex, fully integrated solutions. We are able to leverage our broad range of products and technologies to deliver a tailored solution that best addresses a specific customer’s needs, including a growing portfolio of smart water technologies encompassed in our Water One® platform. Key capital and related aftermarket service and product offerings include filtration, reverse osmosis, ion exchange and continuous deionization. As a result of our speed, capabilities and experience, we serve as a trusted partner to over 25,000 industrial customers, including a substantial majority of Fortune 500 industrial companies. As water is a critical component in many industrial production processes, unavailability of proper water purity, specification or quality can lead to significant constraints, downtime and increased operating costs.

We market our offerings through our direct sales and service team, which is organized geographically and by end market and is complemented by an inside sales force, field sales engineers and a growing e‑commerce platform. Our Industrial Segment sales organization focuses on direct sales with a market‑vertical focus across geographic, strategic and e‑commerce channels to market. As of September 30, 2018, our Industrial Segment services network included approximately 600 field service and 150 engineering employees, and over 90% of our customers are within two hours’ travel of one of our branches.

Municipal Segment
We maintain a comprehensive municipal representative network in the United States, providing us with a unique ability to influence specifications and the basis of design for new treatment facilities. We also maintain relationships with engineering firms, operators and other key influencers through our direct technical sales force to drive adoption of our offerings. As of September 30, 2018, our Municipal Segment sales organization consisted of a network of over 80 independent manufacturing representative companies, supported by our approximately 100 field service technicians and approximately 80 sales personnel, organized across wastewater treatment, municipal services and MEMCOR structures globally.
Products Segment
Our Products Segment customer base includes water treatment designers, OEMs, engineering firms, integrators and our own Industrial and Municipal Segments. Our Products Segment sales organization consists of five direct and indirect sales and aftermarket channels: (i) our direct and third‑party aquatics and disinfection sales representatives target commercial aquatics, municipal and industrial water treatment in Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific geographies, (ii) our process and drinking water sales channels work with non‑exclusive OEMs and with our Industrial Segment to build small, “skidded” solutions for global industrial customers, to get our modular solutions specified into larger units and projects, (iii) our electrochlorination sales managers typically work with representatives of ship builders, shipyards, ship owners, service providers and manufacturers to have our products, services and solutions specified into commercial and military ships and offshore oil and gas rigs, (iv) our separation technology channel managers and sales representatives work with a large network of third‑party manufacturers’ representatives that are exclusive to specific territories or industries and leverage direct sales in industries not covered by third‑party representatives and (v) our direct sales force sell our anodes into Americas, Europe and China geographies, and opportunistically cross‑sell electrocatalytic products to our anode customers. As of September 30, 2018, we had active relationships with more than 200 OEM partnerships and managed over 250 channel partners.
Research, Development and Engineering
We utilize a disciplined, stage‑gate process-consisting of development, field test, commercialization, supply chain and sourcing decisions-to identify and develop new technologies to commercialize, focus our efforts on and engage early with supply‑chain management to promote profitability. We focus on tuck‑in acquisitions as additional resources for new product innovation and development. 
Our global research, development and engineering footprint includes six facilities located in the United States, the Netherlands, Germany, Singapore and Australia, staffed with managers, scientists, researchers, engineers and technicians, along with partnerships spanning leading universities research centers and other outside agencies. We spent approximately $15.9 million during the year ended September 30, 2018 on research, development and engineering, primarily related to employee costs.
Information Technology
Our information technology systems consist of enterprise management, e‑commerce, customer relationship and field service management, customer quoting and billing, environmental compliance, business and operational support, procurement and sales force management systems. We utilize an e‑commerce platform that makes our products available to customers at all times, and we provide our e‑commerce customers with both general and customer‑specific portals, which provide customized pricing for strategic customer accounts. Further, in connection with our ePro initiative, we have adopted SAP Ariba to assist in automating and centralizing our procurement process. In 2018, we started implementing the S4 HANA SAP platform across certain of our acquired businesses. It is our intention to build this platform to support all of our core businesses and transition from our current ECC 6.0 SAP platform. We update and build our information technology infrastructure through further investments focused on cost efficiencies, reliability, functionality and scalability.

Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We currently have over 1,250 granted or pending patents. We undertake to strategically and proactively develop our intellectual property portfolio by pursuing patent protection, obtaining copyrights and registering our trademarks in the United States and in foreign countries. We currently rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and control access to our intellectual property through license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non‑disclosure agreements with third parties, employment agreements and other contractual rights, to protect our intellectual property rights.
Competition
Our industry is highly fragmented, and includes a number of regional and niche‑offering focused competitors. Competition is largely based on product performance, reliability and innovativeness of products, services and solutions, application expertise and process knowledge, brand reputation, energy and water efficiency, product compliance with regulatory and environmental requirements, product lifecycle cost, scalability, timeliness of delivery, proximity of service centers to our customers, effectiveness of our distribution channels and price. Within each of our segments and the various businesses that comprise them, we compete with a fragmented range of companies, but do not have any individually key competitors.
Backlog
Backlog represents the total amount of revenue we expect to receive as a result of contracts and orders awarded to us. However, because many of our contracts and orders are subject to reduction, cancellation or termination at the option of our customer, backlog is not an indication of our future performance. As of September 30, 2018, our backlog was approximately $607.4 million, which includes service, aftermarket and capital projects. Upon adoption of ASU 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, during the first quarter of 2019 we will be disclosing backlog solely based on the expected future revenue for unfulfilled and remaining performance obligations for capital projects where neither Evoqua nor the customer can terminate the contract without penalty.
Employees
As of September 30, 2018, we had approximately 4,000 employees. Of these employees, approximately 56% were full‑time salaried level staff and the remaining employees consisted of a mix of full‑time and part‑time hourly workers. Approximately 74% of our employees work in our U.S. operations and approximately 26% work in foreign operations. None of our facilities in the United States or Canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements. As is common in Germany and the Netherlands, our employee populations there are represented by works councils. We are not involved in any material disputes with our employees and believe that relations with our employees and, to the extent applicable, with our organized labor unions, are good.
Insurance
We maintain insurance policies to cover directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary, crime, special accident, property, business interruption, cargo, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, environmental, umbrella and excess liability insurance.
All of our insurance policies are with third‑party carriers and syndicates with financial ratings of an A or better. We and our global insurance broker regularly review our insurance policies and believe the premiums, deductibles, coverage limits and scope of coverage under such policies are reasonable and appropriate for our business. The continued availability of appropriate insurance policies on commercially reasonable terms is important to our ability to operate our business and to maintain our reputation. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”

Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive and varied laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to anti‑corruption and trade, data security and privacy, employment, workplace safety, public health and safety, product safety, intellectual property, transportation, zoning and fire codes. We operate our business in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
In particular, our international operations subject us to laws and regulations related to anti-corruption and trade, including those related to export and import compliance, anti-trust, anti-bribery and money laundering. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws and regulations, and we have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in compliance with applicable United States and international laws and regulations. However, any violation of such laws, regulations or policies could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, debarment from government contracts and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Failure to comply with applicable anti-corruption and trade laws, regulations and policies, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, could result in fines and criminal penalties, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.”
In certain countries where we operate, our employees are represented by a works council, as required by local law. In such countries, we are required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these works councils in connection with certain corporate decisions, such as a major restructuring, a change of control or changes to local management. Certain other decisions that directly involve employment matters applicable either to all employees or certain groups of employees may also require works council approval. Further, certain of our international operations offer employees defined benefit plans in compliance with applicable local legal provisions requiring payments of, among other things, mandatory pension payments or allocations for severance pay. None of our U.S. or Canadian employees are represented by unions or works councils, and our U.S. and Canadian operations do not maintain defined-benefit plans.
In addition, there are numerous U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding data security, privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other user data, the scope of which is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. If our efforts to protect the security of information about our customers, suppliers and employees are unsuccessful, a significant data security breach may result in costly government enforcement actions, private litigation and negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers, and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could suffer. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-If we experience a significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, our business and reputation could suffer.” Further, governments are continuing to focus on privacy and data security and it is possible that new privacy or data security laws will be passed or existing laws will be amended in a way that is material to our business.
Environmental Matters
The geographic breadth of our facilities and the nature of our operations subject us to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in jurisdictions throughout the world. Such laws and regulations relate to, among other things, emissions to air, the treatment and discharge of drinking water and wastewater, the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the handling, storage, use, transport, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and solid, hazardous and other wastes, product safety and workplace health and safety. These laws and regulations impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on our operations and the products we distribute. The failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third‑party claims, damage to property or natural resources and personal injury claims, requirements to investigate or cleanup property or to pay for the costs of investigation or cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment, remedial actions or the pulling of products from the market, and could negatively impact our reputation with customers. We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that, in the opinion of management, are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. However, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business, the products we distribute, the services we provide and the business of our customers, and the interpretation or enforcement of these laws 
17

and regulations, are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predict accurately the effect that changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may have upon our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Should environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, become more stringent, our costs could increase and significant capital expenditures or operational restrictions could be required, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. However, such increased stringency could also increase demand for our products, services and solutions, which assist various industries and municipalities in meeting environmental and safety requirements for the treatment and discharge of drinking water and wastewater. In addition, increased public awareness of the presence and human health impacts of man‑made chemicals and naturally occurring contaminants in drinking water may increase demand for our municipal service offerings. Correspondingly, if stringent laws or regulations are delayed or are not enacted, or repealed or amended to be less stringent, or enacted with prolonged phase‑in periods, or not enforced, then demand for our products and services may also be reduced.
The nature of our operations, which involve the handling, storage, use, transport, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and solid, hazardous and other wastes, exposes us to the risk of liability and claims associated with contamination at our current and former facilities or sites where we have disposed of or arranged for the disposal of waste, or with the impact of our products and services on human health and safety and the environment. Laws and regulations with respect to the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous materials upon statutorily defined parties, including us, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal. We have been subject to claims and remediation obligations, including having been named as a potentially responsible party, in certain proceedings initiated pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and similar state and foreign laws, regulations and statutes, and may be named a potentially responsible party in other similar proceedings in the future. Unforeseen expenditures or liabilities may arise in connection with such matters.
