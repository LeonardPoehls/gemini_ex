 Item 1. Business 

ProLung is developing, and commercializing its predictive analytic lung cancer risk test, which it refers to as the Electro Pulmonary Nodule Scan, EPN Scan, or the ProLung Test. The ProLung Test was developed to accelerate the assessment of malignancy in lung abnormalities or lesions found in the chest by Computed Tomography (CT) scan. Time is of the essence for these patients and their families as they may have to wait from three months to three and one half years to assess the risk of malignancy. Because lung biopsies are invasive and lung surgery may be life threatening, physicians, patients and insurance companies delay biopsies and the therapies until the risk of malignancy is greater than 50%. For these patients, the delay reduces the potential treatment window and causes mental trauma.

The ProLung Test can be administered as soon as the lesion is identified by CT, without waiting, and may provide a much faster pathway to biopsy and therapy or relaxed watchful waiting. The ProLung Test is non-invasive, immediate, painless and non-radiating. It costs a fraction of repeat CT studies and requires as little as 30 minutes. Most importantly, it may eliminate the anguish of waiting for these patients and accelerate their access to therapy. 

In the United States, a dramatic change in the early detection of lung lesions is underway. Beginning in 2013, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommended CT screening guidelines for lung cancer in adults aged 55 to 80 who have a 30 pack-year history and currently smoke or have quit smoking in the past 15 years. In February 2015, the U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service announced its coverage of lung cancer screening by CT. This newly reimbursed screening procedure is increasing the number of individuals with suspicious findings in the lung that may be candidates for the ProLung Test. 

In May 2013, ProLung received the CE mark in Europe for its Electro Pulmonary Nodule Scanner. This marking is regulatory approval that clears the marketing and sale of the EPN Scan in the European Economic Area and European Free Trade Association Countries representing 509 million individuals and 31 member states. ProLung has tested a total of 150 patients in Italy, Switzerland and Germany and has the opportunity to develop its European market following U.S. FDA approval and the practice of widespread lung cancer screening.

In the United States, ProLung submitted an application for marketing approval under Section 510(k) from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In February, 2015, we received a letter from the FDA identifying a number of issues, questions, and concerns in our application, including the risk classification of the test, the study design and study analysis along with what we consider other less important questions. In subsequent meetings with the FDA, ProLung succeeded in reducing the number of concerns and was asked to complete an additional study. As of April 2017, 335 of a 350 patient study have been enrolled. Before the FDA can grant approval of our application, we must resubmit the application with the results of the requested study and resolve or negotiate the removal of the remaining issues previously identified by the FDA as well as address possible issues to be identified in the future. 

From inception to date, we have generated limited revenues. We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company under the federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.

Lung Cancer Market Summary

According to the World Health Organization, cancer is expected to overtake heart disease as the leading worldwide cause of death. Lung cancer is by far the deadliest of all cancer sites, killing more people than breast, prostate, colon, liver, kidney, and melanoma cancers combined. Each year there are over 1.6 million new cases of lung cancer worldwide, as well as nearly 1.4 million deaths. It kills more women than breast cancer and the lifetime chance of developing lung cancer is 1:17 in women and 1:14 in men.1Lung Cancer Incidence and Mortality
 
 | New Cases | Deaths 
United States2 | 222,500 | 155,870 
European Union3 | 313,000 | 268,000 
China4 | 653,000 | 597,000 
World5 | 1,825,000 | 1,590,000

 
Lung cancer patients face median five-year survival rates of only 16 percent (compared to 93 percent for breast cancer and 100 percent for prostate cancer)6. Survival rates of lung cancer lags behind that of other cancer sites due to a lack of early and effective detection, and a challenging biopsy. A significant amount of time is required to assess the risk under current guidelines. Should innovation reduce the time required for assess the risk of malignancy, lung cancer mortality would approach that of other cancer sites. In those instances when lung cancer was detected in its earliest stage, five year survive improves by 38%. Experts project that with accurate and early diagnosis, five-year survival could approach 80 percent.7

U.S. Market  potential market of 24 million patients

Americans at high risk:
 
Region | Population (in millions) | At high risk13 (in millions) | Market Channel 
United States | 319 | 123 | Direct & Indirect

Symptomatic:
 
Each year 225,500 are diagnosed with lung cancer. Approximately 90 percent of lung cancer patients are symptomatic at presentation (~200,250).8
 
Asymptomatic /Incidental:
 
In addition, an estimated 13.5 million chest CT scans are performed annually, primarily for other purposes, of which 18 percent reveal incidental non-calcified solitary pulmonary nodules resulting in an estimated 2.4 million patients without lung cancer symptoms whose indeterminate masses require follow-up.9

Lung Cancer Screening:

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are 123 million Americans at risk of lung cancer (96 million current and former smokers plus 27 million exposed to carcinogenic agents at home or in industry).10 In the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial of 53,454 patients, approximately 24% of the CT scans performed were positive revealing a lung nodule suspicious for lung cancer that required follow-up.11 CT screening was recommended by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force on December 31, 2013 and Medicare began to pay for lung cancer screening on February 5, 2016. If the approximate 100 million Americans at high risk for lung cancer received a low dose CT screen approximately 24% (24 million) Americans may reveal lung nodules requiring follow up and these patients would be eligible to receive the EPN Scan. 

In the U.S., 12 hospital groups are currently involved in ProLungs EPN Scan in lung cancer research, and we have plans to expend to an additional two hospitals and clinics for pre and post market related research. Assuming that our 510(k) de Novo FDA clearance is granted, of which there can be no assurance, we plan to transition hospitals involved in research to commercial placements of the EPN Scan System and consumable test kit.

European Market  potential market of 30 million patients

The European Union and European Free Trade Association Countries represent 510 million individuals and 31 member states. Europe has some of the highest smoking prevalence of any region in the world which has led to a high prevalence of lung cancer. In 2012, the World Health Organization estimates that 268,000 individuals died from lung cancer and that more than 313,000 cases were diagnosed in the European Union. According to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, lung cancer rates in Europe will outreach other leading cancers. Among European women in particular, it is estimated lung cancer rates might reach or outnumber those of breast cancer with predicted lung cancer rates rising 9 percent to 14/100,000 in 2015, while other cancer rates are trending downward.

Following the publication of the National Lung Screening Trial (2010) in the United States, multiple studies are underway in Europe to confirm benefits of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer in the European population. In December 2015, the United Kingdom Lung Screening Trial (UKLS) published results indicating a 73% increase in five-year survivability if high risk patients received LDCT lung cancer screening. Multiple European lung cancer screening trials are expected to reach conclusion and publication in the coming year, further laying the groundwork for implementation of national lung cancer screening programs.

It is estimated that 26% of Europeans smoke, or approximately 133 million individuals who are at high-risk of lung cancer. According to rates in the published National Lung Screening Trial (2010), over 30 million these individuals will have an indeterminate lung nodule and require follow up to determine the risk of malignancy. As the number of individuals with indeterminate lung nodules continues to increase in Europe, risk stratification tools such as the ProLung Test are needed to close the gap between discovery of a nodule and the determination of malignancy. When European nations begin to implement lung cancer screening programs, millions more of these individuals will become candidates for the ProLung Test.

ProLung has regulatory approval for the European Union and European Free Trade Association Countries. On May 10, 2013, the EPN Scan was assessed and certified as meeting the requirements of Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices The European regulatory authorities have the right to audit periodically and on a random basis, our compliance with European Directives. The Company has maintained audit-tested compliance with the ISO 13485 quality system requirements for more than three years. In Europe, the ProLung predictive analytic device is indicated for use in patients who have undergone CT in which a pulmonary lesion of indeterminate significance has been detected. We are marketing the EPN Scan for use as an aid in the risk stratification of such patients for the presence of lung cancer.

In January 2016, we initiated an Italian registry and enrolled 150 patients who received the EPN Scan at four leading Italian cancer centers. Released results were comparable to those of published trials. Further commercial testing is underway at clinics in Germany and Switzerland.
 
China Market  potential market of 90 million patients

According to the World Health Organization, the number of smokers is steadily growing in China and increasing at higher rates than any other region. One in three of the worlds cigarettes is smoked in China. The average Chinese smoker consumes 22 cigarettes per day. This is nearly a 50% increase from 1980. Overall, more cigarettes are smoked in China than in the next top 29 cigarette-consuming countries combined. Lung cancer is epidemic in China with 653,000 deaths due to lung cancer and an estimated 597,000 news cases of lung cancer. The World Health Organization estimates that the annual lung cancer mortality rate in China may reach 1 million by 2025. In addition, air pollution presents a significant environmental hazard in Chinas many industrial zones and is contributing to the rise of lung cancer prevalence. Air pollution, occupational exposure and an estimated smoking population of over 400 million people will ensure that lung cancer is a public health crisis in China for decades to come.

The government smoking cessation campaign and subsequent intervention are poorly funded and weakly enforced. The political reality is that certain provincial governments are somewhat dependent upon state-owned tobacco sales and taxation. However, despite these challenges, the Government is collaborating with medical leadership in pulmonology and radiology to study low-dose CT screening for earlier detection of lung cancer. The Government has also sponsored economic studies to investigate the reimbursement of lung cancer screening in the health insurance system. Today, asymptomatic lung cancer is detected in the hospital emergency room when looking for something else. Future implementation of a lung cancer screen will create a greater need for a risk stratification test such as the ProLung Test.

It is estimated that 28% percent of the 1.3 billion person Chinese populations smokes, including over 50% of the Chinese male population. This creates a high-risk population of over 400 million individuals who are at-risk for lung cancer. According to rates in the published National Lung Screening Trial (2010), approximately 90 million individuals of this at-risk population will have an indeterminate pulmonary lesion and require follow up to determine the risk of malignancy. As the number of individuals with indeterminate lung nodules continues to increase in China, risk stratification tools such as the ProLung Test will be needed to close the gap between discovery of a nodule and the determination of malignancy. This clinical need for risk stratification will be multiplied if a lung cancer screening program is implemented in the Chinese healthcare system.

We have licensed a Chinese entity the non-exclusive rights to sell ProLung products in China provided that the licensee does not export from China. We offer limited clinical and training support and are entitled to a royalty of seven percent of the licensees revenue. Our involvement with the licensee is not expected to require additional investment by ProLung and ProLung has the right to license its technology to other parties.

In February 2014, the Chinese licensee received approval to manufacture, but not to market or sell the device in China as a lung cancer risk stratification device in Wuxi near Shanghai. On March 15, 2015, the licensee entered clinical trials at two prominent hospitals for the purpose of seeking regulatory approval to market and sell ProLungs EPN Scan in China. The licensee has since expanded the trial to two additional premier cancer hospitals.

Latin American Market  potential market of 25 million patients

Latin America, the original producer and consumer of tobacco, has exported tobacco consumption across the globe in only 6 centuries. Nearly 10% of the worlds smokers live in Latin America (i.e., more than 120 million). The World Health Organization estimates that half of these smokers will suffer premature tobacco-related illness and death. The average per person cigarette consumption among smokers in Latin American countries ranges between 500 and 1500 cigarettes per year. While accurate data on smoking rates varies widely between countries and urban versus rural locales, according to the Pan American Health Organization there is an alarming increase of youth smoking prevalence in Latin American nations. Youth age 13-15 years old in Latin and South America smoke more than adults in many countries. There is an overall trend of females smoking more than their male counterparts. If these rates are not decreased, many experts believe lung cancer will emerge as the main cause of death in the region. According to The Cancer Atlas, lung cancer is already the leading cause of cancer death for both sexes combined in the Americas region.

Lung cancer screening pilot programs are beginning in multiple urban centers across Latin American in response to the now epidemic lung cancer rates in the region. It is important for physicians to have a cost-effective tool for risk stratification of indeterminate pulmonary nodules as to not increase the economic hurdle that already hinders many from across to quality healthcare in this region. The ProLung Test may offer a cost effective and economically advantageous method for risk stratification in Latin America health systems.

Latin American has a population of approximately 626 million people with a population at-risk for lung cancer of at least 120 million. In accordance with rates from the National Lung Screening Trial (2010) roughly 25 million individuals will have an indeterminate pulmonary lesion and require follow up to determine the risk of malignancy. As the number of individuals with indeterminate lung nodules increases in Latin America, risk stratification tools such as the ProLung Test are needed to close the gap between discovery of a nodule and the determination of malignancy. This clinical need for risk stratification will be multiplied if lung cancer screening programs are implemented across Latin American nations.

ProLung has planned sponsorship and speaking opportunities at pulmonary and lung cancer specific symposia in Latin America and has developed relationships with key regional opinion leaders in lung cancer management. ProLung is in discussions with distributors in the major Latin American markets for distribution and commercialization deals. Based on primary physician feedback and response, ProLung expects a viable and strong market for a risk stratification tool such as the ProLung Test. We have not commenced seeking required approvals in any countries in the Latin American market and are unsure when, or if, we will see such approvals.

Competition
 
The development and commercialization of new products to improve the accuracy and efficiency of risk stratification of lung cancer is competitive and we expect considerable competition from major medical device companies, laboratory biomarker tests, and academic institutions that are conducting research in lung cancer. Extensive research and financial resources have been invested in the discovery and development of new lung cancer identification tests. Potential competing technologies include, but are not limited to; breath markers, sputum cytology12 and DNA related markers, blood markers13, radiography and CT imaging.
 
The timing of market introduction of some of our potential products or of competitors products may be an important competitive factor. We plan to sell into the European market prior to entry into the U.S. market and other international markets. We believe the speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical trials and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities to market are important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors including product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, reimbursement, and patent position. We believe that our EPN Scan is superior or equivalent to existing alternatives in all of these areas, other than availability (in the U.S. due to lack of FDA approval) and reimbursement. We are in the process of seeking reimbursement approval in the European Union and expect to seek reimbursement approval in the U.S. when we obtain marketing approval.

The Electro Pulmonary Nodule Scan

We believe the EPN Scan is the only predictive analytic focused upon the lung. ProLungs bioconductance technology is the first accurate and reliable mass averaging bioconductance device that has shown utility to evaluate the risk of lung cancer in patients with lesions of the lung in well-controlled clinical trials. The novel mass averaging bioconductance technology of the Company refers to the simultaneous consideration of multiple measurement pathways. 
 
The EPN Scan will be introduced to the market like a standard predictive analytic test without the need for transmission of a physical sample or specimen. Instead, the EPN Scan acquires precision bioconductance measurements by means of a patented Probe and disposable diaphoretic electrodes14 placed on the back and arms. The data containing precision measurements is processed by a proprietary classifier algorithm and a report is electronically generated that may be used by the physician in addition other risk factors such as nodule size, family history, gender, histology and other risk stratification information to evaluate patients with suspicious masses or lesions identified by CT scan. The EPN Scan is immediate, pain-free, non-invasive, and non-radiating. It requires little patient preparation and can be completed in less than 20 minutes by a proficient technician.
 
We provide the following components of the EPN Scan system:
 
·
 EPN Scanner System - The EPN Scanner System consists of the EPN Probe, the EPN Scanner and EPN tower, monitor and keyboard which are all medical grade components available for sale in English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian versions. 

·
 EPN Scan Kit  Each single-use EPN Scan Kit is sold in a hygienic, non-sterile envelope that displays a unique identifier code that is required for access to a EPN Scan report together with all of the components necessary to assure precision test performance, patient comfort and hygiene. Each EPN Scan Kit includes six diaphoretic electrodes, one ProLung Probe tip and introducer and one moistening sponge.
The EPN Scan Procedure

1.
 The EPN Scan System is connected to the probe, to the electrode cables, and to the power supply. Following a brief power-on sequence, the EPN Scan completes self-diagnostics.

2.
 The patient is selected and seated. 

3.
 ProLung EPN Scan kit is opened and removed from its tamper-proof packaging.

4.
 Single-use diaphoretic electrodes are placed at sites on the patients back and arms.

5.
 Session data is entered including technician name, physician name, report delivery method and patient data.

6.
 Testing begins, as prompted by the device, by applying the probe to acquire measurement data from sites on the chest, shoulders and arms. 

7.
 Monitors the acquisition of real-time data. Should re-measurement be required, the device provides visual and audible notification that it has not received usable data.

Governmental Regulations

Marketing Approvals
 
We must receive separate regulatory approvals from the FDA and equivalent regulatory bodies in other countries for each of the devices before we can sell them commercially in the U.S. or internationally. We cannot make the claims necessary to market any of our product candidates until we have completed the requirements for regulatory approval. We do not know whether regulatory authorities will grant approval for any of the products that we, our marketing partners, or distribution partners will develop. 

A summary of the status of our marketing approvals in the key initial markets we have identified is set forth below: 
 
·
 United States. ProLung submitted a 510(k) Class II submission to the FDA on March 20, 2014. Devices cleared via Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act can be marketed and sold in the United States. 

In the United States, ProLung submitted an application for marketing approval under Section 510(k) from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In February, 2015, we received a letter from the FDA identifying a number of issues, questions, and concerns in our application, including the risk classification of the test, the study design and study analysis along with what we consider other less important questions. In subsequent meetings with the FDA, ProLung succeeded in reducing the number of concerns and was asked to complete an additional study. As of April 2017, 335 of a 350 patient study have been enrolled. Before the FDA can grant approval of our application, we must resubmit the application with the results of the requested study and resolve or negotiate the removal of the remaining issues previously identified by the FDA as well as address possible issues to be identified in the future. 

·
 European Union. CE marking was granted as of May 10, 2013 for the EPN Scan which permits the product to be sold throughout the European Economic Area (European Union member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), Switzerland, and Turkey. CE marking requires manufacturers to maintain an ISO 13485 Quality System.

 Latin America. ProLung has planned sponsorship and speaking opportunities at pulmonary and lung cancer specific symposia in Latin America and has developed relationships with key regional opinion leaders in lung cancer management. ProLung is in discussion with distributors in the major Latin American markets for distribution and commercialization deals. Based on primary physician feedback and response, ProLung expects a viable and strong market for a risk stratification device such as the EPN Scan. 

·
 China. State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) roughly follows the FDA model and approval from the SFDA permits the marketing and sale of the device in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). To be sold in China, medical devices must be registered with Chinese health authorities. In February 2014, the Companys licensor in China received approval to manufacture the device from the Beijing government. Additional approvals are required to market and sell the device in this market. 

After each respective regulatory approval is obtained, the next step in each of these markets is for insurance companies or government agencies, as applicable, to agree to reimburse for the EPN Scan. We have not commenced this process in the U.S. or China, as we do not have marketing approval. 

Manufacturing Requirements

As a manufacturer of medical devices, we must comply with the 21 CFR Part 820 Good Manufacturing Practice regulations established by the FDA. These requirements are meant to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective. We maintain a quality management system that includes standard operating procedures for key processes such as manufacturing, record keeping, post market surveillance, complaint handling and corrective and preventative action. Our quality management system is currently ISO 1348542 certified and complies with the 21 CFR Part 820 Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. Contract manufactures we select will qualify with the 21 CFR 820 Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, which may reduce or eliminate the need for the Company to comply with certain manufacturing requirements as discussed below. We will also be subject to similar requirements imposed by other countries.

Manufacturing
 
We currently manufacture the EPN Scanner and the EPN Scan Kit. When volume requirements exceed current manufacturing capacity, we intend to utilize contract manufacturers for the physical manufacturing of our products. This may afford us numerous benefits, including:
 
·
 reduce or eliminate significant start-up costs required to acquire manufacturing personnel and brick and mortar manufacturing facilities;

·
 the ability to ramp up production quickly;

·
 access to leading technologies, supply chain networks and best-in-class manufacturing processes for its products;

·
 flexibility to use one or many manufacturers in many regions of the world to optimize costs, production volumes, material availability, lead times, and to meet various regional regulations.
 
We have interviewed, performed site visits, and qualified multiple, redundant contract manufacturers which will be required to produce our products. As of December 31, 2016 we have no contractual obligations with such contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of our products. 
 
Our prospective contract manufacturers will source our product components from multiple specialized vendors that supply plastics, sheet metal, machining, cables, wire harnesses, and other computer hardware components. We maintain our own design control and ISO 13485 quality system. 
 
Research and Development

The Company spent $1,219,189 and $1,250,723 on company-sponsored research and development during fiscal years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Employees
 
As of April 17, 2017, the Company had eight employees. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.
 
We believe we will remain an emerging growth company through at least December 31, 2017.

Because of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an emerging growth company and because we will have an extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards, we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
