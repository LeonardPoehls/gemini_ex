ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Telenav is a leading provider of connected car and location-based platform products and services. We utilize our automotive navigation platform and our advertising platform to deliver these products and services. Our automotive navigation platform allows us to deliver enhanced location-based services to automobile manufacturers, as well as original equipment manufacturers and tier one suppliers, to which we refer collectively as OEMs. Our advertising platform, which we provide through our Thinknear subsidiary, delivers highly targeted advertising services leveraging our location expertise for advertisers and advertising agencies. We report operating results in three business segments: automotive, advertising and mobile navigation. Our fiscal year ends June 30. In this Form 10-K, we refer to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017 and ending June 30, 2018 as fiscal 2015, fiscal 2016, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, respectively. Our total revenue was $160.2 million in fiscal 2015, $183.3 million in fiscal 2016 and $169.6 million in fiscal 2017. Our net loss was $23.1 million in fiscal 2015, $35.3 million in fiscal 2016 and $47.3 million in fiscal 2017.
Our legacy mobile navigation business has declined steadily since fiscal 2013, and we expect it to continue to decline and represent less than 10% of our consolidated revenue commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Telenav began offering its mobile navigation services in 2003. Our mobile navigation business generates revenue from our partnerships with wireless carriers who sell our navigation services to their subscribers either as a standalone service or in a bundle with other data or services. The mobile navigation business has declined both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue from $116.4 million, or 61% of our revenue, in fiscal 2013 to $19.0 million, or 11% of our revenue, in fiscal 2017, as subscriptions for paid navigation services declined in favor of free or freemium navigation services offered by our competitors with greater resources and name recognition, such as Google and Apple. We have experienced and anticipate that we will continue to experience the non-renewal of our agreements for these services by our wireless carrier customers as demand from their subscribers declines. In the event our mobile navigation business ceases to be profitable or we determine that it diverts resources from strategic growth areas of our business, we may ultimately elect to terminate our legacy wireless carrier mobile navigation business.
We derive revenue primarily from automobile manufacturers and OEMs, advertisers and advertising agencies. We receive revenue from automobile manufacturers whose vehicles contain our proprietary software and are able to access our personalized navigation services and OEMs who provide larger systems in which our automotive navigation services are integrated. These manufacturers and OEMs generally do not provide us with any volume or revenue guarantees. In addition, we have a growing business in mobile advertising where our customers are primarily advertising agencies, which represent national and regional brands, and channel partners, which work closely with local and small business advertisers. 
For our automotive segment customers, we offer our automotive and mobile navigation platform products and services to vehicle manufacturers and OEMs for distribution with vehicles. We believe our history as a supplier of cloud-based navigation services combined with our proven track record of working closely with these automobile manufacturers and OEMs provides a unique advantage in the automotive navigation marketplace over our competitors. We offer traditional navigation products that are built into the vehicle, which we refer to as on-board, connected navigation services that use our mobile phone-based wireless connectivity, which we refer to as brought-in, and hybrid solutions that contain both on-board and connected functionality. We provide our automotive navigation products and services to automobile manufacturers such as Ford Motor Company and affiliated entities, or Ford, which represented 69% of our revenue in fiscal 2017, General Motors Holdings and its affiliates, or GM, and Toyota Motor Corporation, or Toyota.
We believe our advertising delivery platform offers significant audience reach, sophisticated targeting capabilities and the ability to deliver interactive and engaging ad experiences to consumers on their mobile devices. We are experts in location-based advertising and believe we offer differentiated value to brick-and-mortar and brand advertisers through our location targeting capabilities. Our technology focuses on managing the complexity and scale associated with mobile location data to deliver better mobile campaigns for our advertising partners. We deliver mobile advertisements by leveraging our proprietary in-house ad serving technology. Our inventory, or accessible market, is comprised of thousands of mobile applications and mobile websites that are accessed through advertising exchanges using programmatic real-time bidding, or RTB, tools.

Automotive Navigation
Industry background
We believe the automobile industry is undergoing a significant change in the way that it develops and acquires technology for vehicles. This shift is impacting automobile manufacturers and OEMs. Historically a car included a collection of relatively distinct functional capabilities, for example the radio, the air conditioning system and the braking system. Each system operated independently and thus could be provided by a different OEM or third party supplier. More recently, this piece-by-piece approach to assembling cars has been replaced with a much more comprehensive and systematic approach, which integrates a number of technology solutions within a vehicle. This transition is evident in the changes to in-car infotainment solutions, from which consumers are demanding better integrated and more feature rich experiences. This transition has impacted the delivery of navigation services in passenger vehicles. For instance, automobile manufacturers are introducing lower priced navigation units as a central component of on-board entertainment and information systems rather than as standalone units and are making navigation standard on more vehicles. Furthermore, enhanced integrated premium navigation solutions extend beyond traditional navigation units by combining audio and voice capabilities with wireless network connectivity to deliver real time location services, such as traffic, weather information and other connected data.
Automotive navigation systems are typically on-board or brought-in. On-board navigation systems represent the traditional products with all key navigation elements of the system residing in the car as a self-contained application along with the related software and content, and the system does not require access to the Internet or wireless networks to function. Brought-in systems utilize mobile phone-based wireless connectivity, but use the car's internal electronic systems including the video screen and audio capabilities. In some cases, the on-board service is enhanced by the delivery of certain “live” data and connected functionality, such as real-time traffic conditions, cloud search, and/or cloud routing delivered wirelessly to the on-board system for display, which results in a type of hybrid service capability.
Industry challenges
The automobile industry is experiencing significant consumer demand for in-car connected services resulting from the availability of mobile phone-based Internet services which have reset consumer expectations. For example, on-board navigation systems are limited to the vehicle in which they are installed. The mapping and POI data is loaded when the vehicle is manufactured and requires time, cost and effort to update through a visit to a dealer or via an SD card and more recently, through updates provided using Wi-Fi capabilities. These on-board systems have typically been sold as an optional feature for a one-time charge with limited adoption by consumers. Automobile manufacturers that can enhance the in-car experience with mobile connectivity and improved infotainment capabilities are finding greater acceptance from consumers, but the delivery of these capabilities is technically challenging and not a traditional part of the automobile manufacturer's capabilities. This challenge is driving automobile manufacturers to seek new partners to create differentiated in-car experiences. Automobile manufacturers and OEMs want to provide connected navigation services in a way that can be used safely by the driver “keeping hands on the wheel and eyes on the road” and effectively integrate with large in-vehicle display or vehicle speakers, voice recognition and location sensors. In addition, the automobile industry has seen the recent introduction of brought-in platforms and products such as Apple's CarPlay and Google's auto initiatives, including Open Automotive Alliance, which take control of the product and platform away from the automobile manufacturer or OEM and could diminish brand loyalty to the automobile manufacturer.
Our competitive strengths
Automobile manufacturers procure the various elements of each car that they manufacture from a number of suppliers directly and through OEMs. We work directly with automobile manufacturers such as Ford, GM and Toyota, as well as through OEMs. Our strong track record as a connected and personalized navigation services provider to mobile phones and our history of working with large wireless carriers has provided us with skills and technology that are well suited to meet the demands faced by today's automobile manufacturers and OEMs. The sales cycle for automotive navigation systems is long, consultative and requires direct and continuous engagement with the automobile manufacturer and OEMs to succeed in securing business. Often the automobile manufacturer uses the sales process to help it to define the ultimate product that it chooses to deliver to its end users in a way that not only enhances customer experience but also allows the automobile manufacturer to differentiate itself from the competition. We believe that our success with brought-in and on-board navigation at Ford, GM and Toyota, and the continuing shift in emphasis to connected services has demonstrated the strength of our offerings to other automobile manufacturers and OEMs. Our ability to bring innovative in-car user experiences that are optimized for the driving experience sets us apart from other providers of phone based offerings, such as Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto.

Our automotive services and products
We entered the automotive navigation services business in fiscal 2008, initially with Ford, and our first brought-in navigation product was launched in Ford's model year 2010 vehicles. Since that time, we have been working with Ford and other automobile manufacturers and OEMs to provide our mobile navigation services and products worldwide through on-board and brought-in systems. Our technology powers automotive navigation services and products that provide accurate, easy to use and connected navigation services to drivers at a low cost. 
Our primary automotive customer to date, Ford, currently distributes our on-board product as a standard or optional feature with its models. Our automotive products are now included in Ford models manufactured and sold in North America, Europe and China, as well as distributed in models sold in South America, Australia and New Zealand. Ford Europe and Ford Australia and New Zealand also offer a map update program under which Ford owners in Europe with SYNC® 3 and in Australia and New Zealand with SYNC® 2 or SYNC 3 are eligible to receive annual map updates at no additional cost through the contractual period. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations - Recent Developments - Ford Map Updates." Most recently, we announced that Ford has chosen Telenav to provide connected services globally for Ford’s SYNC 3 platform starting with select model year 2018 vehicles.
We have agreements with GM that include our brought-in services for GM's vehicles as well as integration of our on-board and connected navigation solutions in its vehicles. Our brought-in services for GM vehicles include GM's OnStar RemoteLink® and associated branded mobile applications powered by our location-based services platform, which includes mapping and one-box search. GM recently added new branding to the provisioning of this service which included MyBuick, MyCadillac, MyChevrolet and MyGMC, or the MyBrand applications. GM also offers a localized version of its OnStar RemoteLink in Europe for GM's Opel and Vauxhall brands. GM recently sold its Opel and Vauxhall brands to PSA Group on August 1, 2017.
In November 2016, we were selected to provide entry level on-board navigation through LG Electronics, Inc., or LG, a Tier 1 supplier for GM's select line of vehicles, for the European market. This solution launched in in Opel's Adam and Corsa model vehicles in 2017. These products are expected to be made available in select vehicles for model years 2018 to 2022. 
In February 2017, GM launched its first model featuring integration of our on-board and connected navigation solution, the 2017 Cadillac CTS and CTS-V. Due to specified future obligations in connection with the model year 2017 launch, we did not recognize any revenue from GM on-board and connected navigation solutions in fiscal 2017, although we did experience an increase in deferred revenue. Our on-board and connected navigation solution is scheduled to become available in additional regions and GM models for model year 2018 and 2019. In May 2017, GM extended its partnership with Telenav to provide GM's next generation on-board and connected navigation solution on select cars for model years 2020 to 2025. 
We have a partnership with Toyota for brought-in navigation services where our Scout GPS Link mobile application is available in Entune® Audio Plus equipped Toyota vehicles in the United States and in certain of its Lexus models equipped with Lexus Display Audio multimedia. Toyota and Lexus vehicles enabled to connect with our Scout GPS Link began shipping in August 2015 and September 2016, respectively. In January 2017, Telenav and Xevo Inc. announced that Scout GPS Link and Xevo™ Engine Link were chosen to provide brought-in navigation services, including a fully interactive moving map, for select model year 2018 Toyota vehicles equipped with Entune 3.0, as well as certain Lexus vehicles. Our fully interactive solution is expected to become available for model years 2018 to 2023. We anticipate that Toyota and Lexus will offer both our current solution and the new fully interactive solution in model year 2018 vehicles, with the availability of each solution dependent upon the Toyota and Lexus model and trim level. Toyota has announced that the 2018 Camry will be the first model to be offered with the fully interactive solution.
In August 2017, Daimler selected Telenav’s enhanced OSM platform and navigation SDK to power its Mercedes-Benz COMAND TOUCH® Rear Seat Entertainment system throughout the world. Our solution will power the mapping, search and passenger-driver interactive functions.
Our products and services provide our automobile manufacturers and OEMs with the flexibility to use the full range of technologies to deliver on-board products, brought-in services or hybrid products and services, as well as to enhance our navigation solutions with real-time data such as traffic, fuel prices, fresh maps and POIs for enhanced user experiences by drivers. In addition, as the market transitions to cars that are “always connected,” we expect our product and service offerings to become more personalized.

Platform and architecture
Our offerings for automotive navigation services are tailored to meet the requirements of the automobile manufacturers and OEMs while leveraging our expertise with respect to client design and functionality. Our automotive navigation products also offer the capability to connect to our auto and mobile navigation platform for updated data and services. We have created an automotive reference product, or ARP, which allows us to show auto manufacturers and OEMs our entire product portfolio capabilities. Auto manufacturers or OEMs may then elect to have us configure the ARP to meet their needs as an on-board system or an on-board system with connectivity to live data services. In addition, we have designed custom versions of our navigation products to be exclusively cloud-based solutions for those manufacturers or OEMs seeking connected solution only services. 
We have developed proprietary technologies that enable us to provide location-based mapping and navigation services. These technologies include both client-based and cloud-based services. Our client technologies include a navigation and guidance engine and tools that allow us to efficiently develop and deploy new applications for vehicles and mobile phones. Our back-end cloud services technologies allow us to deliver real-time location-based data and services capabilities to support our clients. We have developed a flexible platform that allows us to use multiple data providers for navigation, maps, points of interest, or POIs, traffic and other location-based content services. More recently, we have been expanding our offering of automotive solutions that utilize navigation to also enhance automotive OEM offerings of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, or ADAS, and semi-autonomous capabilities. Such ADAS features use map attributes to tell the vehicle about upcoming road characteristics such as curvature and elevation. This information is used by the vehicle to improve fuel economy and safety.
In January 2014, we acquired skobbler GmbH, or skobbler, a leading provider of technologies that enhance OpenStreetMap, or OSM, mapping data. By combining skobbler's technologies with other proprietary Telenav technologies, we have developed a range of OSM capabilities that allow us to use these crowd sourced maps for more advanced services such as navigation. We deployed OSM as part of our Toyota solution, whereby Toyota’s Entune Audio Plus equipped vehicles and Lexus Display Audio multimedia equipped vehicles are enabled to connect with our Scout GPS Link mobile application. We believe that focusing our efforts on OSM will better position us relative to our competitors and expand the nature and extent of our product offerings.
Our software and client application development processes, which include design, porting and publication processes, allow us to extend our services to different automobiles across various automotive platforms and in-car electronic systems to meet the requirements of automobile manufacturers and OEMs for our on-board and brought-in automotive navigation products.
Our back-end cloud technologies include our Geographic Information System, or GIS, engines for local search, voice recognition, geo alert and advanced geo data aggregation, traffic and a mobile advertising platform. We have developed customized voice recognition technology built upon a third party voice recognition engine to serve the specific needs of navigation services customers. We leverage our existing back-end cloud technologies for deployment to automobile manufacturer and OEM solution applications. We utilize existing technology to expand the connectivity and service offerings for in-car experiences, including seamless interaction between end users' mobile devices and on-board automobile systems such as displays, sensors and audio for our automotive brought-in navigation solutions.
We developed a search technology that focuses on information with localized relevance and accuracy to address the needs of automotive and mobile phone users. Our proprietary GIS provides fast route and map generation while optimizing the route based on real-time traffic conditions. Because our proprietary GIS efficiently uses computing resources, we are able to scale our servers economically for our automotive brought-in solutions.
Advertising Platform
Industry background
Mobile advertising provides advertisers with many benefits over traditional advertising media and PC-based online advertising, such as anytime, anywhere access, personalization, location targeting and relevance. The development of the mobile advertising ecosystem has mirrored the development for online PC-based advertising. A key differentiator in the quality and effectiveness of mobile advertising is the ability to identify the location of the user. Location is a powerful indicator of an individual's interests and likely actions because it provides context about the user that is not available in traditional advertising. Advertising delivered to mobile devices has the potential to increase the impact and relevance of an ad to the user. For example, an ad can be targeted to a consumer who is in close proximity to a retail store, or to a consumer who may live in an area that advertisers wish to target based on demographics or other characteristics. Given the benefits of mobile advertising as compared 
4

to traditional offline advertising and PC-based online advertising, we expect and market studies indicate that marketers will continue to shift their advertising budgets to mobile as this market continues to grow. 
Industry challenges
The mobile advertising marketplace is a dynamic, fast growing industry with many new participants. Advertisers are transitioning significant portions of their marketing budgets to the mobile marketplace where many of the traditional approaches to engaging customers are different and the means to reach their customers presents new challenges. These advertisers need to be able to conduct ad campaigns that achieve favorable return on investment, or ROI. ROI typically includes elements related to message reach, audience targeting capabilities and campaign effectiveness measurements.  Advertisers are particularly focused on measures of effectiveness for mobile which are much less mature and defined than other advertising options. The mobile advertising marketplace is comprised of application developers, advertising networks, mobile agencies, advertising exchanges and demand-side platforms, among others.  The various market participants tend to focus on specific elements of the marketplace and each try to deliver unique technology offerings to assist advertisers. Some focus on targeting, others on audience data and still others on the location information that makes the mobile marketplace distinct from all other advertising opportunities. Thinknear focuses on use of location data to build consumer insights, develop targeting tools, and create unique audiences that enable brands to connect with mobile consumers. Tracking the performance of ads in applications and user interactions with those ads is difficult and requires significant technological capabilities and know-how.
Our competitive strengths 
Our mobile advertising solution combines the large and growing pool of mobile impressions marked with location information, a unique ability to focus on particular audiences, and dynamic user content customizable based on location.
We have developed a number of techniques that allow us to differentiate between ad impressions that include highly-accurate location data and those that do not. Our proprietary Location Score™ technology measures the accuracy of location information within advertising impressions in order to build audience segments that can be targeted for our customers. Our ability to effectively filter out inaccurate data is a key competitive advantage in the rapidly shifting mobile advertising space.
Because of our ability to identify real-time and historical location data, as well as our ability to ingest contextual targeting data, we can target our ads on specified demographics and advertiser defined customer segments. For example, an ad delivered in a geographic area where it happens to be raining can provide a rain-related message. An ad for sunblock can be limited to areas with a high level of sunlight and ultraviolet radiation. In addition, it is our ability to do this at significant scale that allows advertisers to reach their target audience.
Our services
Our advertising services are built around the ability to provide sophisticated location-based advertising in a manner that allows advertisers to connect with consumers on mobile devices. For example:
Creative - We run a wide range of creative ad units, including static, dynamic, mobile video and rich media content. Our creative allows national advertisers to easily “localize” their content without having to create thousands of individual campaigns. Our creative focuses on leveraging location data to incorporate local context such as distance to a store location, information on where to purchase a product or nearby events that could impact the potential consumer.
Targeting - We offer a variety of targeting tools to our advertising clients to improve the performance of the campaigns. Our targeting includes both audience-focused tools centered on reaching specific customer segments and proximity based tools focused on driving foot traffic to retail locations and other direct-response related metrics.
Reports and metrics - We offer clients a broad range of reporting that allows them to monitor all their advertising campaigns and explains clearly what is happening at any particular point in time with respect to any of the campaigns being run. Our platform provides advertisers with a rich set of analytics and insights.
Platform and architecture
Our mobile advertising platform is hosted in the cloud, primarily by Amazon Web Services, or AWS. We leverage the flexibility and scalability of cloud service providers to meet our scale requirements. 
5

We have developed proprietary technologies that enable us to deliver location-based advertising across all types of mobile devices at scale. Our platform integrates location-enabled mobile advertising inventory with a number of contextual and location-based triggers to allow us to target mobile users. Our platform permits us to bid and deliver ad impressions through advertising exchanges in less than 30 milliseconds and to do so on billions of potential impressions every day. In addition, we are able to target our mobile campaigns based on a variety of criteria beyond location. Our platform was built to provide scalability through the use of machine-based decision processes, which allows us to execute thousands of campaigns, each with complex targeting criteria across multiple inventory sources.

Infrastructure and operations
Automotive Navigation
Our end users rely on our services primarily while on the road. As a result, we strive to ensure the continuous availability of our services through our high quality hosting platform and operational excellence.
Data center facilities. We developed our infrastructure with the goal of maximizing the availability of our applications, which are hosted on a highly scalable and available network located in AWS facilities in California, Oregon, Virginia, Germany, Ireland and South Korea. 
We entered into hosted service agreements with AWS for primary resource capacity in addition to disaster recovery capacity. Pursuant to the service agreements, AWS provides leased facility space, power, cooling and Internet connectivity for a term of one year, and such agreements are subject to renewal.
Advertising platform
We developed our advertising platform infrastructure with the goal of maximizing the performance of our platform. Our platform is hosted on a highly scalable and available network provided by AWS. Our advertising platform has been designed to place significant focus on the location of any particular unit of display advertising made available for purchase on real time bidding ad exchanges. This focus on location provides us with the speed and capability to more rapidly bid on the inventory that we believe is best suited for our customers' advertising needs. Our use of AWS provides significant flexibility with respect to service capability to meet any peaks in demand from our advertisers.
Research and development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development and testing of our services and products. Our engineering team has deep expertise and experience in GPS and wireless and connected services and we have a number of personnel with longstanding experience with location services applications and scaling hosted service models. In addition, through our acquisition of Thinknear and our own internal efforts, we have developed expertise in real time bidding and advertising targeting capabilities.
Our current research and development efforts are focused on: 

• | timely execution and delivery of contracted customer solutions while maintaining strict adherence to requirements such as privacy and security;


• | developing a unified platform that enables efficient deployment of our solutions across multiple customers and programs;


• | improving and expanding features, functionality and performance of our existing services;


• | creating new applications, services and products for automobiles, mobile phones and mobile phone operating systems;


• | developing key technology and content to reduce third party costs;


• | developing innovative and engaging advertising products that allow for highly effective targeting of end users and provide for accurate measurement of behavior; and


• | building features and functionality that allow OSM to be used as a substitute for maps licensed from third party providers.

Our development strategy is to identify features, services and products that are, or are expected to be, needed or desired by end users. 
As of June 30, 2017, our research and development team consisted of 604 people, 191 of whom are located in Santa Clara and Culver City, California and 413 of whom are located in Cluj, Romania; Shanghai and Xi'an, China; Berlin, Germany; and Incheon, South Korea. We have been successful in creating cross-border capabilities for high value engineering at lower cost. Our U.S., China and Romanian research and development operations function together to provide service and product development for our automotive customers. Our Romanian development efforts also focus on our OSM products. Our research and development expenses were $68.1 million, $68.9 million and $73.1 million for fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. 
Marketing and sales
Automotive Navigation
In connection with sales efforts directed at auto manufacturers and OEMs, we employ a sales team that focuses on targeted customers and responds to requests for proposal and related sales opportunities.
The design and sales cycle for automotive navigation products and services is substantially longer than those associated with our advertising network services. The automotive sales cycle is consultative and requires direct and continuous management of the customer and OEMs to succeed in securing opportunities to design our services and products into new vehicles. Often the automobile manufacturer uses the sales process to help them to define the ultimate product that they choose to deliver to their end users. For example, design wins for vehicles may be awarded 12 to 36 months prior to the anticipated model year launch of the vehicle. However, once we launch services with an automobile manufacturer, our application and services are typically bundled with the vehicles for multiple years because of the longer automotive product cycles.
Advertising Platform
Marketing. We market our advertising services based upon our location and data expertise. We are building brand recognition and customer relationships based upon a consultative relationship with key advertising buyers, primarily advertising agencies. Given the mobile advertising marketplace is still in its infancy, we believe that we have an opportunity to influence the way buyers understand the advertising opportunity. 
Sales. We are engaged in direct sales efforts to expand the reach of our mobile advertising solutions. We strive to improve the efficiency and productivity of our sales force, which will result in an increase in our advertising sales headcount during fiscal 2018; however, individual sales representatives typically take six to nine months to become fully productive.
Customers
We derive revenue primarily from automobile manufacturers and OEMs, and advertisers and advertising agencies. We derive our revenue primarily from automobile manufacturers and OEMs whose vehicles contain our proprietary software and are able to access our navigation services. In addition, we have a growing business in mobile advertising where our customers are primarily advertising agencies that represent national and regional brands, and channel partners that work closely with local and small business advertisers. To a lesser extent, we have legacy relationships with wireless carrier customers to provide mobile navigation services to their subscribers through mobile phones.
We generate revenue from automobile manufacturers and OEMs for delivery of customized software and royalties from the distribution of this customized software for on-board, brought-in and hybrid automotive navigation solutions. In addition, we earn royalties from brought-in services for vehicle applications powered by our location-based services platform. We typically enter into long term supply arrangements with our auto customers to provide our solutions across multiple car models in multiple regions around the world.
We also generate revenue from advertisers and advertising agencies for the delivery of advertising impressions based on the specific terms of the advertising contract. 
Our revenue from customers located in the United States comprised 96%, 97% and 88% of our total revenue for fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Ford
We are substantially dependent on Ford for our revenue. In fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017, Ford represented 61%, 71% and 69% of our revenue, respectively. We expect Ford to represent a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.

We employ administrative, physical and technical safeguards to prevent unauthorized collection, access, use and disclosure of our end users' private data and to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. We do not use any end user data for direct marketing or promotions without the consent of the user and do not store any user location information that personally identifies the end user except to deliver and support our services. We are also required to comply with our customers' privacy and data securities policies.
Intellectual property 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services and products are available.
We seek to patent key concepts, components, protocols, processes and other inventions. As of June 30, 2017, we held 130 U.S. patents and 124 foreign patents expiring between April 11, 2020 and September 21, 2035, and have 67 U.S. and 42 foreign patent applications pending. Of the pending 67 U.S. patent applications, 66 are nonprovisional utility patent applications. These patents and patent applications may relate to features and functions of our services and the technology platforms we use to provide them. We have filed, and will continue to file, patent applications in the United States and other countries where there 
8

exists a strategic technological or business reason to do so. Any future patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
As of June 30, 2017, we owned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office registered trademarks for Geocookie®, ONMYWAY®, Scout®, Sipity®, skobbler®, Telenav®, and Thinknear®, as well as the logos for Telenav, Scout and skobbler. We also own the Telenav registered trademark in Canada, China, the European Union, Mexico and the United Kingdom.

We endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with which we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on the success of our legal actions against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.
We also enter into various types of licensing agreements to obtain access to technology or data that we utilize in connection with our navigation services. Our contracts with certain licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments, which are payable regardless of the ultimate volume of revenue derived from the number of paying end users. Our most important agreements are with the providers of maps pursuant to which we generally pay a monthly fee per end user or copy or a per transaction fee. We obtain map data from HERE North America, LLC, or HERE, pursuant to a master data license agreement dated December 1, 2002. HERE is principally owned by a consortium consisting of Audi AG, or Audi, BMW AG, or BMW, and Mercedes AG, or Mercedes. Our agreement with HERE was automatically renewed under its existing terms through January 31, 2018, and automatically renews for successive one year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term. In addition, we have entered into separate territory license agreements with HERE under which we are licensed to use certain map data for particular programs with certain of our current automotive customers to fulfill their requirements. The term of these territory licenses with HERE vary based on the customer and program, and can be extended for additional periods. Our agreement with HERE also allows a party to terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations and fails to cure such breach. 
In addition, we obtain other data such as map, weather updates, gas prices, POI and traffic information from additional providers.
Competition
The markets for development, distribution and sale of location services and advertising services are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, public relations, sales, distribution and other resources than we do.
We compete in the automotive navigation market with established automobile manufacturers and OEMs and providers of on-board navigation services such as AISIN AW CO., Ltd, or AISIN, Robert Bosch GmbH, or Bosch, Elektrobit Corporation, or Elektrobit, Garmin, HERE, TomTom and NNG LLC, or NNG, as well as other competitors such as Apple and Google.
We compete in the advertising network services business with mobile platform providers, including Google, Apple, Facebook, Inc., or Facebook, and GroundTruth, Inc., or GroundTruth, Verve Wireless, Inc., or Verve Wireless, PlaceIQ, Inc., or PlaceIQ, and NinthDecimal, Inc., or NinthDecimal, among others. 
Competition in our markets is based primarily on product placement and performance including features, functions, reliability, flexibility, scalability and interoperability; automobile manufacturer and OEM and advertising agency relationships; technological expertise, capabilities and innovation; price of services and products and total cost of ownership; brand recognition; and size and financial stability of operations. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors based upon the performance, reliability and breadth of our services and products and our technical experience.
Some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, including with respect to the following:

• | significantly greater revenue and financial resources;

9


• | ownership of mapping and other content allowing them to offer a more vertically integrated solution;


• | stronger brand and consumer recognition in a particular market segment, geographic region or worldwide;


• | the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products;


• | access to core technology and intellectual property, including more extensive patent portfolios;


• | access to custom or proprietary content;


• | quicker pace of innovation;


• | stronger automotive, OEM, advertising agency and advertiser relationships;


• | more financial flexibility and experience to make acquisitions;


• | lower labor and development costs; and


• | broader global distribution and presence.

Our competitors’ and potential competitors’ advantages over us could make it more difficult for us to sell our navigation services and advertising network services, and could result in increased pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share or expected market share, any of which would likely cause harm to our business, operating results and financial condition.
