Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a science-driven biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel therapies to treat ophthalmic diseases, with a focus on age-related and orphan retinal diseases. Our multi-track strategy is to leverage our clinical experience and retina expertise to develop therapies for large market, age-related retinal diseases, where unmet medical needs remain for these patients, and for orphan eye diseases with a focus on underserved patients, and to utilize a disciplined business development approach to obtain additional products, product candidates and technologies in these disease areas. We believe that there are advantages to pursuing drug development for orphan indications, including the potential for regulatory exclusivity, the potential for clinical trials with smaller sample sizes and the potential for accelerated development timelines. Our team has significant ophthalmic drug development experience and deep relationships with global ophthalmology thought leaders. We have an extensive network of ophthalmic clinical trial sites, having worked with over 250 sites worldwide. We believe that the combination of these factors, together with our experience in designing and executing IND-enabling studies and clinical trials for eye diseases, and specifically back of the eye diseases, provide us a competitive advantage. 
We are developing Zimura® (avacincaptad pegol), our complement C5 inhibitor, for dry and wet forms of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, which is a disorder of the central portion of the retina, known as the macula, that may result in loss of central vision, and autosomal recessive Stargardt disease, or STDG1, which is an orphan inherited retinal disease that also may result in loss of central and peripheral vision. In connection with our Stargardt clinical trial, which we recently initiated, we have expanded our network of thought leaders and clinical trial sites for orphan ophthalmic indications to include leading research university hospitals around the world, where patients with orphan retinal diseases are often referred. 
We are actively engaged in extensive business development efforts to identify, evaluate and potentially obtain rights to and develop additional therapeutic and gene therapy product candidates that would complement our strategic goals and leverage our competitive advantages. We believe that our strategy will provide multiple potential opportunities to bring ophthalmic therapies to market.
Zimura
Based on our Zimura development experience to date, as well as scientific literature in the field, we believe there is a strong rationale to pursue the development of our C5 complement inhibitor, Zimura, in multiple ophthalmic diseases. Zimura is a chemically-synthesized, pegylated RNA aptamer. Aptamers are short molecules made up of a single stranded nucleic acid sequence or an amino acid sequence that bind molecular targets with high selectivity and specificity. We have multiple clinical development programs for Zimura ongoing or planned to initiate by the end of 2018. Our ongoing and planned clinical trials for Zimura, all of which are designed to obtain data to guide potential future development efforts, include the following:

• | OPH2003 (geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry AMD): an ongoing, randomized, double–masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with geographic atrophy, or GA, secondary to dry AMD. GA, the end stage of dry AMD, is a disease characterized by retinal cell death and degeneration of retinal tissue. 


• | OPH2007 (wet AMD): an ongoing, randomized, dose-ranging, open-label, multi-center Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or anti-VEGF, agent Lucentis® (ranibizumab) for the treatment of wet AMD in patients who have not previously been treated with anti-VEGF agents, referred to as treatment-naïve patients. Wet AMD is characterized by the presence and growth of abnormal new blood vessels under and through the retina.

• | OPH2006 (IPCV): an ongoing, randomized, dose-ranging, open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with the anti-VEGF agent Eylea® (aflibercept) for the treatment of idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or IPCV, in patients who have not responded to Eylea monotherapy. IPCV is an age-related retinal disease involving the choroidal vasculature characterized by the presence of polypoidal lesions, which leads to vision loss. We are at a very early stage of site initiation and patient recruitment for this trial. 


• | OPH2005 (autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1)): an ongoing, randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of autosomal recessive Stargardt disease, referred to as STGD1. We are at a very early stage of patient recruitment for this trial. 


• | Non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis: a planned open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis, a rare inflammatory disease of the back of the eye. 

The following table summarizes the current status of these ongoing and planned Zimura development programs:
On-going Business Development and Pipeline Expansion Activities
Since early 2017, we have been engaged in extensive business development efforts. Without limiting any option, the principal focus of this plan, based on our deep expertise and experience in ophthalmic drug development, has been to actively explore obtaining rights to additional products, product candidates and technologies to treat ophthalmic diseases, particularly those in the back of the eye. We evaluated a large number of assets and platforms during 2017 and continue to actively review assets, platforms and other compelling ophthalmology opportunities that would complement our strategic goals. We have considered multiple opportunities over the last several months, including in-licensing, obtaining rights to products, product candidates or technologies, acquisitions, mergers and reverse mergers. Our selection criteria are based on several factors. In general, we are looking for:

• | compelling science;


• | an identified unmet medical need based on the current standard of care;


• | a meaningful commercial opportunity based on existing treatment options and treatment options known to be in development; and


• | areas where we believe we can apply our competitive advantages.

Based on our work to date, among the novel technologies we have evaluated, we believe that gene therapy solutions may be particularly well-suited for our strategy as potential treatments for both orphan and age-related eye diseases. We remain committed to being opportunistic and will consider other compelling opportunities that may emerge.

Eye Diseases
Eye diseases can be caused by many factors and can affect both the front or back of the eye. In its most extreme cases, eye disease can result in blindness. In the developed world, the major diseases that result in blindness are those affecting the retina and optic nerve, including AMD, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. These diseases deprive patients of their sight and, as a result, their ability to live independently and perform daily activities. Any improvement in vision, or even a slowing of the rate of progression of vision loss, has a tremendous impact on the quality of life of people with impaired vision. There are also many other eye diseases that may be less common but still represent an unmet medical need, particularly orphan diseases associated with a genetic mutation that lead to retinal degeneration and vision loss. We believe these disease areas present several potential opportunities for ophthalmic drug development.
Age Related Macular Degeneration
AMD is a disease characterized by progressive degenerative abnormalities in the macula, a small area in the central portion of the retina responsible for sharp vision. AMD is characteristically a disease of the elderly and is the leading cause of blindness in individuals over the age of 50 in developed countries. There are two forms of AMD, dry AMD and wet AMD. Dry AMD is characterized by degeneration of the macula, and with continued progression over multiple years, may ultimately result in atrophy of the central retina associated with progressive central vision loss. By contrast, wet or neovascular AMD, which is characterized by the growth of abnormal new blood vessels under and into the retina, although less prevalent, is more likely to cause sudden, often substantial, loss of central vision.
According to AMD Alliance International, approximately 10 million people in the United States and 30 million people worldwide suffer from some form of AMD. AMD Alliance International estimates that dry AMD accounts for 85% to 90% of all AMD cases. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data, we estimate that over the next two decades in the United States the number of people aged 55 or older is expected to increase by approximately 36% and the number of people aged 65 and older is expected to increase by approximately 69%. We expect that this increase in the number of elderly people will result in a significant increase in the number of cases of both dry AMD, including cases of GA, and wet AMD in the United States. In addition to having a devastating effect on patients, AMD also has a significant impact on the economy. According to a 2010 study sponsored by AMD Alliance International, the annual direct healthcare system costs of visual impairment worldwide due to AMD were estimated at approximately $255 billion.
Dry AMD
Dry AMD is a significant cause of moderate and severe loss of central vision, affecting vision in both eyes in most patients. Although dry AMD is the most common form of AMD, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or European Medicines Agency, or EMA, approved therapies to treat this condition. In dry AMD, thinning of the retinal pigment epithelial, or RPE, cells in the macula develops, along with other age-related changes to the adjacent retinal and choroidal tissue layers. The RPE is a layer of cells within the retina on which photoreceptors are dependent. Dry AMD is typically associated with yellow–white dots or deposits under the RPE, known as drusen. Unlike in wet AMD, there is an absence of abnormal new blood vessel growth, or neovascularization, in dry AMD. The presence of drusen, in the absence of pathological neovascularization, is critical for making the diagnosis of dry AMD in patients over 50 years of age. GA, the end-stage of dry AMD, can result in progressive and chronic degeneration of the retina characterized by variable thinning and dysfunction of retinal tissue.
The progression of visual outcomes for patients with dry AMD is variable. Most patients experience mild to moderate loss of visual function, manifesting in blurring of central vision in the affected eye, as a result of progressive degeneration of the light–sensitive photoreceptor cells in the macula. There are two instances in which visual loss from dry AMD may lead to severe vision loss:

• | Geographic Atrophy. The progression of dry macular degeneration with age can result in a severe form of retinal degeneration called GA, which typically leads to profound and irreversible vision loss. GA is readily diagnosed during retinal examination using standard diagnostic instruments utilized by ophthalmologists. GA appears as abrupt and deep levels of macular tissue loss. It has sharp margins of characteristic degeneration compared to surrounding healthier macular tissue, resulting in progressive and chronic degeneration of the retina characterized by variable thinning and dysfunction of retinal tissue. A comprehensive epidemiology study published in 2004 in Archives of Ophthalmology estimates that there are approximately 1 million people in the United States with GA. 


• | Conversion to Wet AMD. Dry AMD progresses to the wet form of the disease in approximately 10% – 15% of patients, leading to more rapid and further visual loss. A study on the burden of AMD published in 2006 in the 

4

peer reviewed journal Current Opinion in Ophthalmology, estimated that 1,250,000 people in the United States suffer from wet AMD. In addition, AMD Alliance International reports that approximately 200,000 new cases of wet AMD arise each year in the United States.
The absence of treatment options for dry AMD represents an area of urgent unmet medical need, and a major public health concern for the rapidly increasing elderly population.
Wet AMD
Wet AMD occurs when new and abnormal blood vessels proliferate under or within the retina. These abnormal new blood vessels originate beneath the retina, in a layer called the choroid, and invade into the overlying retinal layers. This abnormal new blood vessel growth is generally referred to as pathological angiogenesis. In the context of wet AMD, pathological angiogenesis is associated with both the development of neovascular cells and the accumulation of other cell types and altered tissue. The pathological neovascular tissue in wet AMD is called the choroidal neovascular complex or choroidal neovascularization. Choroidal neovascularization, or CNV, and adjacent and contiguous areas of blood and altered tissue are referred to as a lesion.
Abnormal new blood vessels tend to be fragile and often bleed and leak fluid into the macula. Untreated, new blood vessel growth and associated leakage typically lead to retinal distortion and rapid vision loss. The end stage of the disease features scarring with irreversible destruction of the macula. Approximately 90% of wet AMD cases involve subfoveal choroidal neovascularization, which is blood vessel growth directly under the central portion of the macula, known as the fovea. We plan to enroll patients with active subfoveal wet AMD in our wet AMD trials.
The current standard of care for wet AMD is administration of anti–VEGF monotherapy agents by intravitreal injection. Anti-VEGF agents prevent VEGF from binding to its natural receptor on endothelial cells in the abnormal new blood vessels, thereby inhibiting further abnormal new blood vessel growth and leakage associated with wet AMD. The FDA has approved the anti-VEGF agents Lucentis, Eylea and Macugen for the treatment of wet AMD. The FDA also has approved photodynamic therapy with Visudyne (PDT) as a treatment for patients with wet AMD. In addition, although approved by the FDA as a cancer therapy, the anti–VEGF drug Avastin® (bevacizumab) is used off–label to treat wet AMD. Lucentis is an antibody fragment derived from the same full-length antibody from which Avastin was derived.
AMD and the Complement System 
The causes of AMD are not completely understood. In addition to advanced age, there are environmental and genetic risk factors for developing AMD including ocular pigmentation, dietary factors, a positive family history for AMD, high blood pressure and smoking. A body of recent scientific literature suggests that complement system activation may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of the disease.
The complement system consists of a series of proteins that are involved in the defense of the host body against infectious agents, or pathogens, and other foreign proteins. The complement system modulates a variety of immune and inflammatory responses to these pathogens and foreign proteins. Under normal circumstances, complement proteins, together with antibodies and white blood cells, act beneficially to protect the host body by removing the pathogens and foreign proteins, together with other cellular debris. The complement system is generally tightly regulated, achieving the proper balance of activation and inhibition depending on the host body’s requirements. Poorly regulated or aberrant activation of the complement system, without a balanced or proportional inhibition of complement proteins, may result in a variety of pathological conditions. Activation of the complement system has been implicated in drusen formation. Moreover, complement system activation has also been implicated in preclinical laser-induced CNV models.
 The complement system is generally activated via one of three biological pathways:

• | the classical pathway, which is activated by an antibody-pathogen protein complex;


• | the alternative pathway, which is activated by the binding of a specific complement protein, C3b, to a pathogen or pathogen fragment; and


• | the lectin pathway, which is activated by the binding of a specific blood, or serum, protein called mannose-binding protein, to carbohydrates present on the surface of pathogens.


5

These pathways eventually converge with the generation of an enzyme known as C3 convertase. C3 convertase cleaves, or separates, a serum protein called C3, into C3a and C3b. C3b is an important element of the body’s immune response, as it binds to pathogens and makes them susceptible to destruction by white blood cells. C3b also cleaves complement protein C5. The cleavage of C5 results in the formation of the terminal complement fragments C5a and C5b. C5a has been found to prime RPE cells for inflammasome activation in the presence of waste products from the visual cycle. Inflammasomes are intracellular protein structures that lead to cell death. C5b, in combination with serum proteins C6, C7, C8 and C9, leads to the generation of C5b-9, or membrane–attack complex, or MAC. MAC accumulation in RPE cells leads to mitochondrial damage and cellular dysfunction, eventually leading to cell death. A study published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology in 2002 described the presence of MAC in post-mortem human donor eyes with dry AMD and GA. 
A simplified illustration of the complement system appears below:
VEGF Inhibition and Complement
Avastin, Lucentis and Eylea, on average, all improve the visual outcomes in eyes with wet AMD. A study published in Ophthalmology, which is the official journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, in 2013, however, found that, despite maximal therapy with monotherapy intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, after one year of treatment the majority of patients do not achieve significant visual gain (defined as a gain of 15 or more ETDRS letters). Furthermore, in another study, an increase in dosage or treatment frequency did not lead to additional efficacy and it appears that a “ceiling” for the effect of anti-VEGF therapy may have been reached. In addition, in a third-party clinical trial, after one year of treatment with an anti-VEGF agent, approximately 18% to 22% of newly diagnosed wet AMD patients lost additional vision, defined as the loss of the ability to read one or more ETDRS letters. In a separate study published in Ophthalmology in 2014, approximately one- fifth of the patients who had received anti-VEGF therapy developed GA within two years of treatment. The authors concluded that anti-VEGF therapy may play a role in the development of atrophy. In a follow-up publication from 2017, the authors found that following five years of anti-VEGF treatment, the cumulative incidence of GA had increased to 38% and concluded that the development of GA was common after five years of anti-VEGF treatment for wet AMD.
Complement factor H, or CFH, is a complement regulatory protein that down-regulates complement system activation in the eye. In a recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in 2017, a direct relationship between VEGF and CFH was demonstrated, where the presence of VEGF up-regulated CFH levels and down-regulated complement system activation. In RPE cells, inhibition of VEGF lead to a decrease in CFH levels. In this study, mice that received anti-VEGF 
6

treatment showed a marked decrease in VEGF and CFH leading to increased MAC levels, suggesting that inhibition of VEGF with anti-VEGF agents may contribute to complement system activation. Further, in patients with wet AMD, aqueous humor samples collected from the front of the patients’ eyes 48 hours after intravitreal injection of Avastin demonstrated a decrease in VEGF levels but an increase in the levels of complement proteins C3a, C4a, and C5a as compared to the levels seen prior to Avastin treatment.
Taken together, these findings indicate that although inhibition of VEGF has a potent effect on CNV leakage, inhibition of VEGF may also potentially contribute to complement system activation by reducing CFH levels and therefore limit the full therapeutic potential of anti-VEGF therapy in wet AMD patients.
Idiopathic Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy
Idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or IPCV, is an age-related disease of the choroid characterized by the presence of polypoidal vascular lesions with or without an associated vascular network. In IPCV, leakage under the RPE, subretinal hemorrhage and RPE detachment are common. When leakage or hemorrhage occurs in the macular region, central vision loss occurs. IPCV is often diagnosed as a variant of wet AMD, although it may occur without the associated neovascularization. IPCV is more prevalent in certain populations with pigmented eye color, including Asian populations. Although anti-VEGF therapy is typically administered for IPCV, multiple studies demonstrate that anti-VEGF therapy may not be as effective in IPCV as it is in wet AMD. For many of the same reasons as those described above under “VEGF Inhibition and Complement,” we believe that complement inhibition when added to anti-VEGF therapy may improve the results of anti-VEGF therapy for patients with IPCV.
Stargardt Disease
Stargardt disease is a rare, inherited genetic disease that causes progressive damage to the macula and retina, leading to loss of central vision in children and adolescents. The autosomal recessive form of the disease is referred to as STGD1. An inherited trait is referred to as autosomal recessive when the subject must inherit the trait from each parent for the condition to manifest. Multiple sources, including the National Eye Institute and Genetics Home Reference, both of which are affiliated with the U.S. National Institutes of Health, estimate the prevalence of Stargardt disease to be between 1 in 8,000 and 1 in 10,000, implying an overall prevalence of 32,000 to 41,000 affected persons in the United States, with, we believe, at least as many affected persons in Europe. STDG1, the most common type of Stargardt disease, is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. For STGD1, a subject must inherit a mutation to the ABCA4 gene from each parent. There are currently no therapies approved by the FDA or EMA to treat Stargardt disease. The FDA has recognized Stargardt as an orphan disease, with several treatments in development having received orphan product designation from the FDA.
Visual Cycle Waste Accumulation and MAC Accumulation
STGD1 is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene, which is responsible for making a protein that helps to clear byproducts resulting from the visual cycle from inside photoreceptor cells in the eye. With a defective copy of the ABCA4 protein, these waste byproducts accumulate in the RPE. Waste byproducts that accumulate in the RPE are referred to as bisretinoids. We believe that the accumulation of bisretinoids in RPE cells leads to activation of the complement system. One of the final products of all three complement pathways is MAC. In RPE cells, MAC is normally cleared by lysosomes, which are organelles within cells responsible for waste degradation and disposal. Bisretinoid accumulation leads to lysosomal dysfunction, potentially preventing the clearance of MAC. MAC accumulation also negatively impacts energy production by the mitochondria inside RPE cells. Bisretinoid and MAC accumulation may lead to RPE cell deterioration and contribute to the loss of photoreceptor cells, leading to a decrease in vision over time.

In April 2017, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, or PNAS, published a study reporting on the effects of complement system modulation in the RPE of a mouse model of Stargardt disease. Injection of a recombinant adeno-associated virus containing the coding sequence for a protein that inhibits complement system activation, Crry, into an albino ABCA4 mutant mouse model led to a two-fold reduction in the accumulation of bisretinoids and a 30% increase in the number of photoreceptor nuclei at one year. The study findings indicate that the inhibition of complement activation may lead to healthier RPE cells, which in turn are better capable of processing bisretinoids in the albino ABCA4 mutant mice when compared to untreated mice. Research performed at Duke University and published in a paper appearing in 2013 in Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science demonstrated that RPE cell damage resulting from the combination of complement system activation and visual cycle waste was far more damaging than either component individually in vitro. When complement factor C5 was blocked, there was a significant improvement in RPE cell viability in vitro. Based on the data from these in vitro and in vivo experiments, we believe molecules involved in inhibition or regulation of complement system activation and MAC accumulation are prime targets for therapeutic intervention in STGD1.

Zimura
We are developing our product candidate Zimura for the treatment of four ophthalmic conditions: GA secondary to dry AMD, wet AMD, IPCV and STDG1. Zimura is a chemically-synthesized, pegylated RNA aptamer. Aptamers are short molecules made up of a single stranded nucleic acid sequence or an amino acid sequence. The specific three-dimensional structure of an aptamer, which results from its specific sequence, allows it to bind molecular targets with high selectivity and specificity. Zimura is designed to target and inhibit the complement protein C5. We believe that Zimura binds to C5 and inhibits it from cleaving into the terminal fragments, C5a and C5b. By inhibiting the formation of complement system terminal fragments, Zimura may decrease the activation of inflammasomes and decrease the formation of MAC, thereby potentially avoiding or slowing the degeneration of RPE cells and providing the rationale as a potential therapy for the four conditions that we are targeting. Zimura is a pegylated aptamer, which means that polyethylene glycol is linked to the chemically-synthesized strand of RNA.
Zimura is administered by intravitreal injection. Before a physician administers an intravitreal injection, the patient typically receives topical numbing drops or injection of a numbing agent. In addition, the administering physician typically rinses the ocular surface with an antiseptic solution. By injecting the active agent into the vitreous cavity, the physician delivers the agent in close vicinity to the active disease site with minimal potential for systemic exposure to non-ocular tissues. 
An intravitreal injection results in an elevation of intraocular pressure, or IOP, which is usually transient. Labels for the currently approved anti-VEGF agents, which are also administered by intravitreal injection, include descriptions related to monitoring IOP after intravitreal injection of these drugs. In our clinical trials, the IOP is monitored after each intravitreal injection. Based on our clinical experience to date, we have not seen any meaningful or sustained increase in IOP in clinical trials involving multiple intravitreal injections on the same day, and we believe that multiple intravitreal injections likely could be delivered safely in the same day.
We have completed three clinical trials of Zimura to date: 

• | a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of GA;


• | a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of Zimura administered in combination with Lucentis for the treatment of wet AMD; and


• | a very small Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of IPCV in patients for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy had failed.

Over 100 patients have been treated with Zimura in these three completed trials, with treatment durations extending up to 48 weeks. All doses of Zimura administered in these trials were well-tolerated, with no drug-related safety concerns identified. 
Based on our clinical experience with Zimura, the scientific literature around complement in the eye and the positive Phase 2 data outcome for a competitor's C3 complement inhibitor in GA, we believe Zimura holds promise as a potential treatment for several ophthalmic diseases. Our ongoing and planned clinical trials for Zimura, all of which are designed to obtain data to guide potential future development efforts, include the following:

• | OPH2003 (geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry AMD): an ongoing, randomized, double–masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with geographic atrophy, or GA, secondary to dry AMD. 


• | OPH2007 (wet AMD): an ongoing, randomized dose-ranging, open-label, multi-center Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with Lucentis for the treatment of wet AMD in treatment-naïve patients. 


• | OPH2006 (IPCV): an ongoing, randomized, dose-ranging, open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with Eylea for the treatment of IPCV in patients who have not responded to Eylea monotherapy. We are at a very early stage of site initiation and patient recruitment for this trial. 


• | OPH2005 (autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1)): an ongoing, randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of autosomal recessive Stargardt disease, referred to as STGD1. We are at a very early stage of patient recruitment for this trial. 

8


• | Non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis: a planned open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis, a rare inflammatory disease of the back of the eye. 

Our Zimura clinical experience to date, as well as our ongoing and planned clinical trials for Zimura, are described in greater detail below. 
Age-related Retinal Disease Clinical Trials
Zimura - Dry AMD Trials

OPH2001: Completed Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial of Zimura for GA Secondary to Dry AMD
In 2011, we completed a multicenter, uncontrolled, open label Phase 1/2a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Zimura administered as a monotherapy in patients with GA. We enrolled 47 patients in this trial. We randomly assigned patients in this trial to one of two dose groups. Patients received a total of five intravitreal injections of either 0.3 mg or 1 mg of Zimura over a 36-week treatment period. Patients received an intravitreal injection of Zimura at day 0, week 4, week 8, week 24 and week 36 of the trial, with a final follow-up visit at week 48. 
Zimura was generally well-tolerated in this trial. We did not observe any evidence of drug related adverse events. We also did not observe any incidence of conversion to wet AMD in eyes treated with Zimura. Adverse events were primarily ocular adverse events in the study eye which were related to the injection procedure.
In addition, we performed assessments of visual acuity to detect any potential decrease in vision associated with intravitreal injections, the administered drug or natural progression of the disease if left untreated. We did not identify any drug related safety issues through measurements of visual acuity.    
Our Phase 1/2a clinical trial was an uncontrolled study with a small sample size and was not powered to detect a difference between Zimura dose groups, or the efficacy of Zimura monotherapy, with statistical significance. The primary purpose of the study was to assess safety and tolerability. However, during the more frequent dosing period, we observed a trend, in favor of the higher of two dose groups, of a relative reduction in the mean growth of the GA lesion area, as measured by fundus autofluorescence images read by an independent reading center. Fundus autofluorescence is a common technique for photographing and documenting the size of GA present in the back of the eye, or fundus. Autofluorescence refers to the natural emission of light by biological structures. In fundus autofluorescence images, areas of atrophy are characterized by lower fluorescence.
9

The mean growth from baseline in the GA lesion area during the first 24 weeks of the trial, when the injections were administered more regularly, was 1.00 mm2 for the 24 patients receiving the 0.3 mg dose and 0.78 mm2 for the 23 patients receiving the 1 mg dose. When the injections were administered on a reduced dosing schedule during the subsequent 24 weeks, this relative trend in reduced growth in GA lesion area was no longer present. The following graph sets forth the mean change in GA lesion area from baseline for the two treatment groups over the course of the trial.
We believe this apparent trend in the relative reduction of mean growth in GA lesion area when Zimura was dosed more frequently, together with the relative loss of the benefit when Zimura was dosed less frequently, may suggest a possible drug effect. 
OPH2003: Ongoing Phase 2b Trial of Zimura for GA Secondary to Dry AMD
We are currently conducting a randomized, double–masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with GA secondary to dry AMD. We initiated this trial during the fourth quarter of 2015. During 2017, based on the announcement of positive data from a competitor studying a different complement inhibitor in a Phase 2 trial in GA, we modified this trial to accelerate the timeline to obtain top-line data. Prior to this initial modification taking effect, we had enrolled approximately 75 patients who were randomized to one of three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio in Part 1 of the trial as follows:

• | monthly intravitreal injection of 1 mg of Zimura;


• | monthly intravitreal injection of 2 mg of Zimura; and


• | monthly sham injection.

Following review of additional third-party clinical trial data and further statistical analysis, we have determined to expand this trial for a total of approximately 275 patients. We are enrolling the approximately 200 remaining patients in Part 2 of the trial by randomizing them to one of three treatment groups in a 1:2:2 ratio as follows:

• | monthly intravitreal injection of 2 mg of Zimura plus a sham injection;


• | monthly intravitreal injections of 4 mg of Zimura (administered as two injections of 2 mg of Zimura on the same day); and


• | monthly sham injections (administered as two separate sham injections).

10

Patients will be treated for 18 months. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is an anatomic endpoint, the mean change in rate of GA growth at 12 months, as measured by fundus autofluorescence. We plan to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint for the 2 mg treatment groups as compared to sham and for the 4 mg treatment group as compared to sham. Given that we have limited data regarding the effect of Zimura in GA, we determined the size of the OPH2003 trial based on our best estimates of the size of trial required to demonstrate a potential clinical benefit for Zimura.  This estimate incorporates our assumptions regarding the potential performance of Zimura in this indication based in part on available third-party clinical data and our statistical analysis of this data.  Given the information above, this trial could be underpowered to demonstrate a potential clinical benefit for Zimura in this indication.
We submitted to the FDA the amended clinical trial protocol for the initial modification early in the fourth quarter of 2017 and are currently enrolling patients in Part 2 of the trial based on the amended protocol. We plan to further amend the protocol for the increased trial size of 275 patients during the first half of 2018. Based on our anticipated enrollment rate and notwithstanding the protocol amendment to increase the trial size, we expect initial top-line data from this trial to be available during the second half of 2019. 

Zimura - Wet AMD Trials    
OPH2000: Completed Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial of Zimura for Wet AMD
In 2009, we completed a multicenter, uncontrolled, ascending dose and parallel group, open-label, first in human Phase 1/2a clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of multiple intravitreal injections of Zimura given in combination with multiple doses of 0.5 mg of Lucentis in patients with wet AMD. We enrolled 60 patients in this trial, of which 58 were treatment-naïve patients, and two were treatment-experienced patients. 
Patients were treated at one of five Zimura dose levels: 0.03 mg, 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg and 3 mg. During Part 1 of the trial, a dose-escalation stage, a total of 17 patients were enrolled. Patients received treatment starting at the lowest dose level to be investigated and then further patients were enrolled in a dose-escalation multiple dose scheme in which patients received Zimura dose levels of 0.03 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg or 3 mg. Forty-three patients were subsequently recruited to the second part of the trial, a parallel group stage, in which patients received Zimura dose levels of 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg or 3 mg. As this was a first in human trial, there were various changes made to the protocol during the trial as data were developed, including a protocol amendment to support a dosing regimen for six monthly injections of Zimura once required toxicology data became available. Seven patients from Part 1 of the study had completed the trial prior to this amendment, and therefore received only three injections of Zimura, while the remaining ten patients from Part 1 received six injections of Zimura. In addition, because of a stability issue with the 3 mg formulation, all patients initially receiving the Zimura 3 mg dose level were switched to the 1 mg dose. The Zimura 2 mg dose level was added to Part 2 of the trial at this time.

Zimura was generally well tolerated in this trial when tested in combination with Lucentis. None of the patients experienced any dose limiting toxicities at any of the dose levels tested. We observed only a single adverse event assessed by the investigators to be related to Zimura, mild subcapsular cataract in one patient in the group treated with 2 mg of Zimura. Despite this event, this patient's visual acuity improved during the study. Adverse events were primarily ocular adverse events in the study eye which were related to the injection procedure. One patient from the 0.3 mg Zimura treatment group withdrew from the trial as a result of a serious adverse event of bacteremia unrelated to study drug or injection procedure, which resulted in a subsequent fatality. Another patient from the 0.3 mg treatment group withdrew from the trial due to investigator's decision. Systemic adverse events in this trial were not frequently reported. No systemic adverse events were assessed as drug related.
Our Phase 1/2a clinical trial was an uncontrolled study with a small sample size and was not powered to detect a difference between Zimura dose groups or the efficacy of Zimura combination therapy with statistical significance. The primary purpose of the study was to assess safety and tolerability. However, in addition to our safety assessment, we performed assessments of visual acuity primarily as safety assessments to detect any decrease in vision associated with the intravitreal drug combination or the injection procedure. We did not identify any safety issues through measurements of visual acuity. There was a general trend towards an improvement in visual acuity seen in all treatment groups. We focused our assessment of vision outcomes on the subgroup of 43 treatment-naïve patients who had received all six Zimura injections at doses of 0.3 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg. This was the most homogeneous group of patients with consistent dosing. We observed a mean increase in visual acuity from baseline at all time points for treatment-naïve patients who received six injections of Zimura at these doses, based on the number of ETDRS letters the patient could read. For this subgroup, at week 24 of the trial, we noted improvements in mean visual acuity from baseline as follows: 13.6 letters for the 13 patients receiving the 0.3 mg dose, 11.7 letters for the 15 patients receiving the 1 mg dose and 15.3 letters for the 15 patients receiving the 2 mg dose. In this subgroup, 
11

22 patients (51%) gained at least 15 ETDRS letters, consisting of six patients (46%) in the 0.3 mg dose group, seven patients (47%) in the 1 mg dose group and nine patients (60%) in the 2 mg dose group.
OPH2004: Phase 2a Trial of Zimura for Treatment-Experienced Wet AMD Patients
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura’s potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF therapy for the treatment of wet AMD in anti-VEGF treatment-experienced patients who did not respond adequately to anti-VEGF monotherapy. In 2017, following our reassessment of our Zimura development programs, we stopped enrolling patients in this trial as we determined that we would initiate a new Zimura wet AMD trial, the OPH2007 trial described below, for treatment-naïve patients. One patient continues to receive treatment in this trial.
OPH2007: Ongoing Phase 2a Trial of Zimura for Treatment- Naïve Wet AMD Patients
We are currently conducting a randomized, dose-ranging, open-label, multi-center Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with 0.5 mg of Lucentis for the treatment of wet AMD. This trial is enrolling treatment-naïve patients. We plan to enroll approximately 60 patients in this trial. We are evaluating different Zimura doses, as well as different combination therapy treatment regimens and dosing intervals in order to obtain information to help guide our potential future development efforts for Zimura in wet AMD.
We plan to evaluate patient data at the 6-month time point. As this is a Phase 2a trial, we plan to evaluate all available safety measures including visual acuity. This trial is an uncontrolled trial with a small sample size designed to assess safety at different dosages and to detect a potential efficacy signal. This trial is not powered to detect a statistically significant difference among the treatment arms or to evaluate the efficacy of Zimura combination therapy with statistical significance.
We initiated this trial during the third quarter of 2017. Based on our anticipated enrollment rate, we expect initial top-line data from this trial to be available by the end of 2018. 
Zimura - IPCV Trials
OPH2002: Completed Phase 2a Clinical Trial of Zimura for IPCV

In late 2014, we initiated a very small, uncontrolled, open-label, Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura’s potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of IPCV in treatment-experienced patients for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy failed. We enrolled four patients in the trial. None of the patients had a greater than 15-ETDRS letter decrease in visual acuity, which is considered a significant loss in visual acuity, following treatment in this study. There were no findings in relation to ophthalmic examinations which were unexpected or of particular concern.
OPH2006: Ongoing Phase 2a Trial of Zimura for IPCV
We are currently conducting a randomized, dose-ranging, open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with Eylea in treatment-experienced patients with IPCV. In this trial, we are enrolling patients who have received three Eylea injections within the previous four months and whose vision has not improved by at least one line on a standard eye chart. We plan to enroll approximately 20 patients in this trial. We are evaluating different Zimura doses, as well as different combination therapy treatment regimens and dosing intervals, in order to obtain information to help guide our potential future development efforts for Zimura in IPCV.
We plan to evaluate patient data at the 9-month time point. As this is a Phase 2a trial, we plan to evaluate all available safety measures including visual acuity. This trial is an uncontrolled trial with a small sample size designed to assess safety at different dosages and to detect a potential efficacy signal. This trial is not powered to detect a statistically significant difference among the treatment arms or to evaluate the efficacy of Zimura combination therapy with statistical significance.
We initiated this trial at the end of 2017 and are currently at a very early stage of site initiation and patient recruitment. Based on our anticipated enrollment rate, we expect initial, top-line data to be available from this trial during the second half of 2019.

Orphan Eye Disease Clinical Trials

Zimura - STDG1 Trial
OPH2005: Ongoing Phase 2b Trial of Zimura for STGD1
We are currently conducting a randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of STGD1. We plan to enroll approximately 120 patients in this trial, making it one of the largest interventional clinical trials for the treatment of STDG1 to date. Patients are being enrolled as follows:

• | approximately 60 patients will be administered:


◦ | 2 mg of Zimura, followed by 2mg of Zimura 14 days later, monthly for three months during an induction phase; followed by


◦ | 4 mg of Zimura (administered as two injections of 2 mg of Zimura on the same day), monthly for 15 additional months during a maintenance phase; and


• | approximately 60 patients will be administered:


◦ | a sham injection, followed by a sham injection 14 days later, monthly for three months; followed by


◦ | two sham injections on the same day, monthly for 15 months.

We plan to evaluate the primary efficacy endpoint at 18-months. The primary efficacy endpoint is an anatomic endpoint, mean rate of change in the area of ellipsoid zone defect, as measured by en-face spectral domain optical coherence tomography, or SD-OCT. SD-OCT is an ultra-high resolution imaging modality commonly used to visualize the retinal tissue. SD-OCT is capable of rendering images in multiple dimensions and from multiple perspectives. This imaging technology allows the demonstration of various layers of the retinal tissue, including the ellipsoid zone, which is rendered in SD-OCT images as a defined layer of photoreceptor cell segments. Areas of defects in the ellipsoid zone can be detected and measured by en-face SD-OCT, which shows an SD-OCT image from the perspective of looking at the retina head on. Scientific literature correlates ellipsoid zone defect with visual dysfunction. 

We previously engaged the Foundation Fighting Blindness to provide us with data from the Foundation's publicly available ProgStar study, the largest natural history study on STGD1 disease to date. We have used this natural history data, as well as the perspectives of the key opinion leaders involved in the ProgStar study, as resources to assist in the design of the OPH2005 trial. 
We have not previously studied Zimura in STGD1 patients. Given that we have no clinical data regarding the effect of Zimura in STGD1, we determined the size of the OPH2005 trial based on the number of patients with STGD1 that we believe could potentially be enrolled within a reasonable period of time. This number may be increased or decreased in light of the actual enrollment rate during the trial. As STGD1 is an orphan indication, to our knowledge there is only very limited natural history data currently available regarding the variability of the planned primary efficacy endpoint in the STGD1 patient population we plan to enroll in this trial. Given the information above, this trial could be underpowered to demonstrate a potential clinical benefit for Zimura in this indication.
We began enrolling patients in this trial in January 2018 and are currently at a very early stage of patient recruitment. Based on our anticipated enrollment rate, we expect initial top-line data from this trial to be available during 2020. 
Zimura - Uveitis Trial
We are currently planning a small, open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis, a rare inflammatory disease of the back of the eye. The FDA has recognized non-infections intermediate and posterior uveitis as an orphan disease, with several treatments either approved or in development having received orphan product designation from the FDA. We plan to initiate this trial during 2018. We have not previously studied Zimura in patients with non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis.

Gene Therapy Research Programs
As we evaluate the unmet medical need for the treatment of orphan ophthalmic diseases, we have considered that many of these diseases are caused by one or more genetic mutations and currently have no approved treatment options available. Further, the potential to achieve an extended treatment effect and possibly a cure through a single gene therapy administration is particularly appealing to patients who do not have any treatment options, as well as for patients with age-related retinal diseases who currently require chronic therapy over years, if not decades.
Gene therapy consists of delivering DNA encoding for a functional protein to a target tissue to facilitate protein synthesis using a recipient's existing cellular machinery. Gene therapy can be used to replace a non-functional protein produced innately by the subject as a result of a genetic mutation or simply as a means of producing and delivering a therapeutic protein that would not otherwise be produced within the body. The DNA, which is generally delivered by a viral vector, is governed by a promoter sequence which controls transcription of the gene of interest, or transgene, into RNA to initiate protein synthesis. Some of the challenges that gene therapy faces are producing vectors that transfect, or deposit the transgene, in only specific cell types, producing the desired protein at the therapeutic dose levels, and avoiding inducing an inflammatory response that leads to tissue damage. We are particularly interested in adeno-associated virus, or AAV, gene therapy delivery vehicles, as AAV vectors are relatively specific to retinal cells and their safety profile in humans is relatively well-documented as compared to other delivery vehicles and gene therapy technologies currently in development. 
In February 2018, we announced that an element of our strategy will include initiating collaborative gene therapy programs focused on discovering and developing novel gene therapy technologies to treat retinal diseases. We intend to investigate promising gene therapy product candidates through collaborations with leading companies and academic and research institutions in the United States and internationally. 
For our first gene therapy research collaboration, we have entered into a series of sponsored research agreements with the University of Massachusetts Medical School, or UMMS, and its Horae Gene Therapy Center to utilize their novel gene delivery technologies and "minigene" therapy approach to target retinal diseases. AAV vectors are generally limited as a delivery vehicle by the size of their genetic cargo, which is restricted to approximately 4,700 base pairs of genetic code. The use of "minigenes" as a novel therapeutic strategy seeks to deliver a shortened but still functional form of a larger gene packaged into a standard-size AAV delivery vector. The "minigene" strategy may offer an innovative solution for diseases that would otherwise be difficult to address through conventional AAV gene replacement therapy where the size of the gene of interest exceeds the transgene packaging capacity of conventional AAV vectors. Furthermore, one of the differentiating advantages of the "minigene" approach is that it could potentially provide a treatment that is independent of the specific mutation a patient has. The scope of the UMMS collaboration addresses Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10, or LCA10, which is the most common type of LCA and is caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene, and STDG1, which is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. LCA10 and STDG1 are both orphan inherited degenerative retinal diseases that lead to vision loss without any FDA or EMA approved treatment. As a condition of each sponsored research agreement, UMMS has granted us an option to obtain an exclusive license to any patents or patent applications that result from the sponsored research.
Remaining Fovista Activities
In December 2016 and August 2017, we received initial top-line data from our three pivotal clinical trials, referred to as OPH1002, OPH1003 and OPH1004, evaluating the anti-platelet derived growth factor, or anti-PDGF, aptamer Fovista® (pegpleranib) administered in combination with anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of wet AMD, indicating that these trials failed to achieve their pre-specified primary endpoints. We have terminated these trials, as well as several other smaller Fovista trials in wet AMD, which we have referred to as the Fovista Expansion Studies. The National Eye Institute and an academic pre-clinical program are evaluating various uses of Fovista for the treatment of retinal capillary hemangiomas associated with the orphan disease Von-Hippel-Lindau Syndrome, and for the treatment of retinoblastoma, a rare cancer of the eye in children, respectively. We have completed our commitments to these two programs, which primarily involved providing Fovista drug product and drug substance that we had on hand for use in the studies. 
Therefore, we do not currently expect any development activity for Fovista going forward, as we have no intentions to resume development of Fovista in wet AMD and our supply commitments for the two external studies are complete. 
Manufacturing
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of Zimura or any other product candidate we may develop. Although we rely and intend to continue to rely upon third–party contract manufacturers to produce our products and product candidates, we have recruited personnel with experience to manage 
14

the third–party contract manufacturers we engage to produce Zimura. We do not have any long-term supply arrangements other than as described below.
Zimura is a chemically-synthesized aptamer. In pursuing our business plan, we could acquire or in-license a variety of types of product candidates, including small molecule drugs, protein drugs or biologics, including gene therapies.  Small molecule drugs are organic compounds of low molecular weight that are generally associated with ready availability of starting materials and ease of synthesis. In contrast, manufacturing for proteins and biologics is more complex, especially in large quantities. Biologic products must be made consistently and in substantial compliance with a clearly defined manufacturing process, and often must be manufactured under aseptic conditions.
The process for manufacturing Zimura consists of chemical synthesis, pegylation, purification and finally freeze drying to form a powder, which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API. Each of these steps involves a relatively common chemical engineering process. The chemical synthesis is similar to peptide manufacturing. In a separate process that follows the chemical synthesis, API for Zimura is dissolved in a liquid solution that includes certain chemical buffers and then is placed into vials from which the intravitreal injection solution is drawn. This process of rendering the API into a liquid solution and placing it into vials is referred to as fill/finish services.
We currently rely upon a single third-party manufacturer, Agilent Technologies, Inc., or Agilent, to supply us with the chemically synthesized aptamer comprising the API for Zimura and a different, single third-party manufacturer, Ajinomoto Althea, Inc., or Althea, to provide fill/finish services for Zimura. We currently obtain Zimura API from Agilent on a purchase order basis. We have entered into a clinical and commercial services agreement with Althea for fill/finish services for Zimura. This agreement is summarized below. We obtain the polyethylene glycol, or PEG, reagent used to make Zimura from a single third–party manufacturer on a purchase order basis. 
Althea Clinical and Commercial Services Agreement 
In October 2016, we and Althea entered into a Clinical and Commercial Services Agreement, which we refer to as the Fill/Finish Services Agreement. Pursuant to the Fill/Finish Services Agreement, Althea has agreed to provide clinical and commercial fill/finish services for Zimura as well as any future product candidates that we and Althea may mutually agree. The Fill/Finish Services Agreement has an initial term that will expire at the end of 2027, absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the Fill/Finish Services Agreement. The initial term of the Fill/Finish Services Agreement may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The amount payable by us to Althea under the Fill/Finish Services Agreement is based on the volume of finished drug product that we order, subject to periodic adjustments over the term of the Fill/Finish Services Agreement. In addition, in the event that we order a specified volume of product, Althea has agreed to supply biological or pharmaceutical drug products meeting certain parameters exclusively to us.
We may cancel any purchase order under the Fill/Finish Services Agreement at any time, subject to the payment of specified cancellation fees. We may terminate the Fill/Finish Services Agreement, without cause, as of any date following the third anniversary of the effective date upon six months’ prior notice to Althea. Each party also has the right to terminate the Services Agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy.
The Fill/Finish Services Agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Althea with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cooperation by Althea in connection with marketing applications for our product candidates, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
Sales and Marketing
We expect that our commercial strategy for any of our product candidates, including whether to retain commercial rights and market and sell the product candidate ourselves or to utilize collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements with third parties in some or all geographic markets, will be determined based on a variety of factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the disease area, the particular indication, the territory in which the product candidate may be marketed and the commercial potential for such product candidate. In addition, our commercial strategy will vary depending on whether the disease is typically treated by general ophthalmology practitioners, specialists, such as retinal specialists, or other sub-specialists. For example, in the United States, retinal specialists perform most of the medical procedures involving diseases of the back of the eye. Intravitreal injection is a specialized procedure. In the vast majority of cases in the United States, retinal specialists perform intravitreal injections. We believe that retinal specialists are sufficiently concentrated that we could effectively promote a product candidate approved for such an indication to these specialists with a targeted specialty sales and marketing group. If successful in the development of any of our product candidates, depending on 
15

the size of the approved indication, we may utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize any such product candidate in markets outside the United States.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic or biosimilar drug companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring products, product candidates or other technologies that we may target to in-license or acquire in pursuit of our business plan.
Growth of our business through our business plan will be based on our selectively licensing or acquiring and then developing product candidates. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that address or seek to address unmet medical needs and creates value in ophthalmology. However, the acquisition and licensing of pharmaceutical products is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to license and acquire products, may have competitive advantages, as may emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisition. Established companies pursuing this strategy may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows and institutional experience.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be the respective drug’s efficacy, safety, method of administration, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third–party payors. The method of administration of Zimura, intravitreal injection, is commonly used to administer ophthalmic drugs for the treatment of sever disease and is generally accepted by patients facing the prospect of sever visual loss or blindness. A therapy that offers a less invasive method of administration, however, might have a competitive advantage over one administered by intravitreal injection, depending on the relative safety of the other method of administration. 
We face competition with respect to our product candidates from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as generic or biosimilar drug companies, worldwide. There are a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the treatment of GA, wet AMD, Stargardt disease, non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis, or other disease indications for which we may develop Zimura. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. We also will face similar competition with respect to any other products or product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. In particular, many companies are pursuing gene therapy approaches for age-related and orphan retinal diseases.
Competitive considerations for Dry AMD and GA:

• | There are a number of products in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat dry AMD, including several that are in development for GA secondary to dry AMD. In general, these product candidates can be categorized based on their proposed mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action for these product candidates include inflammation suppression, such as complement system inhibitors and corticosteroids, visual cycle modulators, antioxidants and neuroprotectants, cell and gene therapies and vascular perfusion enhancers. Based on publicly available information, we are aware that Novartis AG and MorphoSys AG, Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hemera Biosciences, Inc., Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. each have complement inhibitors in

16

development for dry AMD, the most advanced of which we believe is Apellis's pegylated, synthetic peptide targeting complement factor C3. Apellis announced positive Phase 2 results for its product candidate and has announced plans to initiate a Phase 3 program during 2018. If Apellis's Phase 3 program for its complement factor C3 product candidate is successful, it is likely that Apellis may obtain marketing approval for its product candidate in advance of when we could reasonably expect marketing approval for Zimura in GA, if at all. Moreover, based on publicly available information, we are aware that several other companies have announced development programs for the treatment of dry AMD targeting different mechanisms of action outside of the complement system.
Competitive considerations for wet AMD:

• | There are a number of products in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat wet AMD. Based on publicly available information, we are aware that multiple mechanisms of action are in clinical or pre-clinical development for wet AMD, including Angiopoietin-2 inhibitors, including one in development by Roche, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, integrin inhibitors, novel VEGF inhibitors and complement inhibitors, as well as a few remaining PDGF inhibitors. Within the complement system, we are aware that Apellis is planning a Phase 2 clinical trial with their C3 inhibitor in combination with anti-VEGF therapy. Moreover, based on publicly available information, we are aware that several companies and research organizations are pursuing treatments targeting other molecular targets, potential gene therapy treatments and stem cell transplant treatments for the treatment of wet AMD. In addition, other companies are undertaking efforts to develop technologies to allow for topical dosing of therapeutic agents such as anti-VEGF agents or integrin inhibitors through eye-drops or to allow for a less frequent intravitreal dosing schedule than currently used for standard of care anti-VEGF agents.


• | The commercial opportunity for Zimura in wet AMD in particular also could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that reduce or eliminate the use of anti–VEGF drugs for the treatment of patients with wet AMD, since we are only developing Zimura for wet AMD as a combination therapy with anti-VEGF agents. Moreover, we expect that if Zimura is approved for combination therapy for the treatment of wet AMD, the cost of combination treatment would be higher than the cost of treatment of wet AMD with Lucentis, Eylea or particularly Avastin monotherapy. Insurers and other third–party payors may encourage the use of anti–VEGF drugs as monotherapy and discourage the use of Zimura in combination with these drugs. This could limit sales of Zimura for this indication. 

Competitive considerations for Stargardt disease:

• | There are a number of products in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat Stargardt disease. Based on publicly available information, we are aware that Sanofi, Acucela Inc., Alkeus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vision Medicines, Inc., Lin BioScience, Inc., Nightstar Therapeutics plc and ProQR Therapeutics N.V. each have development programs in Stargardt disease. Four of these programs, Acucela, Alkeus, Vision Medicines and Lin BioScience, are exploring the use of oral therapeutics, while Sanofi, with technology provided by Oxford BioMedica plc, and Nightstar are each using a gene therapy approach and ProQR is using an RNA interference approach. Acucela’s, Alkeus’s and Sanofi’s product candidates are each in Phase 2 development. 


• | In the case of orphan diseases such as Stargardt disease, should we be successful in development, our commercialization efforts may rely on non-patent market exclusivity periods under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, or the Orphan Drug Act, and the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Orphan Drug Act only provides exclusivity periods for the specific drug granted orphan designation for a specific indication. In addition, there are limited circumstances under each of the Orphan Drug Act and the Hatch-Waxman Act that could result in our loss of data and marketing exclusivity, which could allow a competitor to enter the market. Failure to maintain either data or market exclusivity period would have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize our product candidates. 

Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know–how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position, among other methods and where patent protection is available, by filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business, and by maintaining our issued patents. We also rely upon trade secrets, know–how, continuing technological innovation and in–licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
17

Our patent portfolio includes the following:

• | patents and patent applications in–licensed from Archemix Corp., or Archemix:


• | composition–of–matter patents covering Zimura, which have issued in the United States, the European Union, Japan and certain other jurisdictions, and which are expected to expire in Japan in 2026 and elsewhere in 2025; and composition–of–matter patent applications covering Zimura, which are pending in certain other jurisdictions, and which, if granted, are expected to expire in 2025; and


• | patents covering the treatment of certain complement mediated disorders with Zimura, Zimura for use in a method of treating certain complement mediated disorders or a composition comprising Zimura for treating certain complement mediated disorders, which have issued in the United States, the European Union, Japan and certain other jurisdictions, and which are expected to expire in the United States and Japan in 2026 and elsewhere in 2025; and


• | patents and patent applications owned by Ophthotech:


• | patent applications covering co–formulations and other proprietary technology relating to Zimura, which are pending in the United States, the European Union, Japan and certain other jurisdictions, and which, if granted, are expected to expire in 2034.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non–provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Hatch–Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended.
Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. The expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us.
We may rely, in some circumstances, upon trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.

Licensing Arrangements
We are a party to an agreement with Archemix Corp. or Archemix, under which we in-licensed rights in certain patents, patent applications and other intellectual property related to Zimura. We entered into this agreement to acquire the intellectual property required to develop, manufacture and commercialize Zimura. Our existing in-license for Zimura imposes certain license fee and diligence obligations on us. We expect to enter into acquisition or license agreements in the future, particularly as we pursue our business plan to acquire or in-license additional products, product candidates or other technologies and expand our product pipeline. We expect that any future acquisition or license agreements would impose license fee, royalty payment and diligence obligations on us. In the future, we may also enter into agreements to out-license intellectual property to our collaboration and research partners to assist in the development and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates. A description of our Zimura license agreement appears below.
Archemix C5 License Agreement
In September 2011, we entered into an amended and restated exclusive license agreement with Archemix relating to anti–C5 aptamers, which we refer to as the C5 agreement. The C5 agreement superseded a July 2007 agreement between us and Archemix. Under the amended and restated agreement, we hold exclusive worldwide licenses (subject to certain pre–existing rights) under specified patents and technology owned or controlled by Archemix to develop, make, use, sell, offer for sale, distribute for sale, import and export pharmaceutical products comprised of or derived from an anti–C5 aptamer for the prevention, treatment, cure or control of human indications, diseases, disorders or conditions of the eye, adnexa of the eye, orbit and optic nerve, other than certain expressly excluded applications.
The license we received under the C5 agreement includes sublicenses to us of rights to specified technology, which we refer to as the SELEX technology, licensed by University License Equity Holdings, Inc., or ULEHI, to Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, and sublicensed by Gilead to Archemix, as well as sublicenses to us of rights to certain other technology licensed by Gilead to Archemix. The C5 agreement contemplates that our rights to these sublicensed technologies will survive termination of the license from ULEHI to Gilead as long as we are not in breach of the C5 agreement, and will survive termination of the sublicense from Gilead to Archemix as long as such termination did not arise from our action or inaction, provided in each case that we agree to be bound to ULEHI or Gilead, as applicable, under the terms of our agreements with Archemix. However, if Archemix, its affiliates and all of Archemix’s assignees and sublicensees, including us, cease to exercise reasonable efforts to develop commercial applications of products and services using the SELEX technology, then Archemix’s rights to the SELEX technology may revert to Gilead or ULEHI, and we would lose our rights to the SELEX technology. 
Financial Terms
In connection with the C5 agreement, as amended, we paid Archemix an upfront licensing fee of $1.0 million and issued to Archemix an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of our series A–1 preferred stock and 500,000 shares of our series B–1 preferred stock. We have also paid Archemix an aggregate of $2.0 million in fees based on our achievement of specified clinical milestone events under the C5 agreement. 
Under the C5 agreement, for each anti–C5 aptamer product that we may develop under the agreement, including Zimura, we are obligated to make additional payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of $57.5 million if we achieve specified development, clinical and regulatory milestones, with $30.5 million of such payments relating a first indication, $24.5 million of such payments relating to second and third indications and $2.5 million of such payments relating to sustained delivery applications. Under the C5 agreement, we are also obligated to make additional payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of $22.5 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones based on net product sales of all anti–C5 products licensed under the agreement. We are also obligated to pay Archemix a double–digit percentage of specified non–royalty payments we may receive from any sublicensee of our rights under the C5 agreement. We are not obligated to pay Archemix a running royalty based on net product sales in connection with the C5 agreement.
Diligence Obligations
We are required to exercise commercially reasonable efforts in developing and commercializing at least one anti–C5 aptamer product and in undertaking investigations and actions required to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to market such product in the United States, the European Union, and Japan, and in such other markets where we determine that it is commercially reasonable to do so.
19

Term and Termination
Unless earlier terminated, the C5 agreement will expire upon the later of 12 years after the first commercial sale in any country of the last licensed product, the expiration of the last–to–expire valid claim of the licensed patents that covers a licensed product, and the date on which no further payments of sublicensing income are to be received by us.
Either we or Archemix may terminate the C5 agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and the breach remains uncured for a specified period. Archemix may also terminate the C5 agreement, or may convert our exclusive license under the agreement to a non–exclusive license, if we challenge or assist a third party in challenging the validity or enforceability of any of the patents licensed under the agreement. We may terminate the agreement at any time and for any or no reason effective at the end of a specified period following our written notice of termination to Archemix.
Government Regulation and Product Approvals
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post–approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review and Approval of Drugs and Biologics in the United States
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Biologic products, including gene therapy products, are licensed for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities, including state agencies.
A drug candidate must be approved by the FDA through a new drug application, or NDA. A biologic candidate is licensed by FDA through approval of a biologic license application, or BLA. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new product in the United States must typically undertake the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well–controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication and the safety, potency and purity of a candidate biologic product for each indication;


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an application requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;


• | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or

20

cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;

• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the application; and


• | compliance with any post–approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post–approval studies.

Preclinical Studies
Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, and the purity and stability of the substance, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations.
The IND and IRB Processes
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved application. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30–day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30–day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human Clinical Trials in Support of an Application
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
21

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or, in certain indications, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. 


• | Phase 2. The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Phase 2a clinical trials tend to be smaller pilot studies for the purpose of demonstrating biological activity and clinical "proof of concept." Phase 2b studies tend to be larger studies focused on finding the optimal dosage and may be controlled. 


• | Phase 3. These clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which denotes a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a product candidate. The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well–controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, identify adverse effects, establish the overall risk–benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 


• | Phase 4. Post–approval studies may be required to be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 

Progress reports detailing the safety results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The FDA or the sponsor or the data monitoring committee may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
Special Regulations and Guidance Governing Gene Therapy Products
The FDA has defined a gene therapy product as one that mediates its effects by transcription and/or translation of transferred genetic material and/or by integrating into the host genome and which is administered as nucleic acids, viruses, or genetically engineered microorganisms. The products may be used to modify cells in vivo or transferred to cells ex vivo prior to administration to the recipient. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with the NIH and the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical, and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols.
In addition to the foregoing, products classified as gene therapies are subject to additional regulation. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies. Although the FDA has indicated that these guidance documents are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any product candidate we may develop. The guidance documents provide additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things, the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing, and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy–related delayed adverse events for a 15–year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.
If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving the NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, a protocol and related documentation must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules prior 
22

to the submission of an IND to the FDA. In addition, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH will convene the RAC to discuss protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public.
Further, to facilitate adverse event reporting and dissemination of additional information about gene therapy trials, the FDA and the NIH established the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, or GeMCRIS. Investigators and sponsors of a human gene transfer trials can utilize this web–based system to report serious adverse events and annual reports. GeMCRIS also allows members of the public to access basic reports about human gene transfer trials registered with the NIH and to search for information such as trial location, the names of investigators conducting trials, and the names of gene transfer products being studied.
Finally, for a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with good tissue practices, or GTP. These standards are found in FDA regulations and guidances that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing.
Review of a Candidate Product by the FDA
If clinical trials are successful, the next step in the development process is the preparation and submission to the FDA of an application. The application is the vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new drug for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. The application must contain a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods, as well as results of preclinical tests, toxicology studies, clinical trials and proposed labeling, among other things. Every new product must be the subject of an approved application before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2018 is $2,421,495 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2018 is $304,162. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
Following submission of an application, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of an application generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in–depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of applications. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the application for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten–month and six–month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured, stored, packaged and tested. These pre–approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an application submission, including component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. 
23

In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is an NME.
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel product candidate to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
The FDA’s Decision on an Application
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post–approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the product candidate’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post–market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations and Accelerated Approval
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life–threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation. The FDA may also approve certain products based on an accelerated basis.
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life–threatening disease or condition, and if the product demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
In 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Product Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life–threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to 
24

breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross–disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
The FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case– by–case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment–limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
Finally, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life–threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
Post–Approval Requirements
Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third–party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; 
25

imposition of post–market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post–approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off–label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off–label uses may be subject to significant liability.
If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch–Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference–listed drug, or RLD.
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug...” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
26

Under the Hatch–Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non–patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non–patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application.
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight (8) months for a drug that has three (3) or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of ‘‘competitor generic therapies’’ or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application.
505(b)(2) NDAs
As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA pursuant to an NDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch–Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically and legally appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the previously approved RLD. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the RLD has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Hatch–Waxman Patent Certification and the 30–Month Stay
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the RLD in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

• | the required patent information has not been filed;


• | the listed patent has expired;


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.

27

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved RLD’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or the 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non–patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of an NCE, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 or BPCIA. That Act established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. As of January 1, 2018, the FDA has approved nine biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidances are expected to be finalized by FDA in the near term.
Under the Act, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new drug product or its method of use may be eligible for a limited patent term extension, also known as patent term restoration, under the Hatch–Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. Patent term extension is generally available only for drug products whose active ingredient has not previously been approved by the FDA. The restoration period granted is typically one–half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an 
28

approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an application or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and any other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
For drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety (90) days after FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless and until FDA promulgates a regulation stating otherwise, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or patent protection, including the non–patent and orphan exclusivity. This six–month exclusivity may be granted if an application sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six–month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent is valid and infringed by the proposed product.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an application for the product and rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different indications. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
29

Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same product for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
The 21st Century Cures Act
On December 13, 2016, President Barack H. Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increasing funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the PHSA to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH. The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges the NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases.
With amendments to the FDCA and the PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain products intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for product applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires the FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved products; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal products intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes the FDA to designate a product as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.
Review and Approval of Products in Europe and other Foreign Jurisdictions
In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent it chooses to sell any products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational product in the European Union, a manufacturer must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Clinical Trial Approval in the European Union
Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of the European Union Member State, or the EU Member State, in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.
In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable to and binding in all EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. The new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 was published on June 16, 2014 but is not expected to apply until 2019. The conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the European Union. Specifically, the new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials.

PRIME Designation in the EU
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
Marketing Authorization
In the European Union, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through several different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across the European Economic Area (i.e. the European Union as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. It is optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases. These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a “major public health interest.” Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease, such as severely disabling or life–threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In these circumstances, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
Specifically, the grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products, and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to EMA which provides an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by EMA.
The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with this procedure, an applicant submits an application for marketing authorization to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States which, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State. Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU Member States. Authorization in accordance with either of these procedures will result in authorization of the medicinal product only in the reference EU Member State and in the other concerned EU Member States.
31

A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation No. 1901/2006 provides that, prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product–specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
Regulatory Data Exclusivity in the European Union
In the European Union, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abridged) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
Periods of Authorization and Renewals in the European Union
A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk–benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the relevant EU Member State. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five–year renewal period. Any marketing authorization that is not followed by the marketing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the EU Member State which delivered the marketing authorization within three years after authorization ceases to be valid.
Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization
As in the United States, marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations.
The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which detail requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. These rules can impose on central marketing authorization holders for medicinal products the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies.
The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the European Union is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the European Union is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States.
In the European Union, the advertising and promotion of products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of 
32

medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off–label promotion. The off–label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The applicable laws at the European Union level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct–to–consumer advertising of prescription–only medicinal products. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may also impose limitations on promotional activities with health care professionals.
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA–approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product–specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so–called Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the Centralized Procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the European Union
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of: (1) a life–threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life–threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and, in addition, a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process, including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom, covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products, is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in 
33

the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third–party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third–party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third–party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost–effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third–party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost–effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third–party payor not to cover a product candidate could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost–containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Government authorities and third–party payors, particularly Medicare, have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications and encouraging the substitution of lower cost or generic products. Pricing pressures recently experienced by the pharmaceutical industry may be further exacerbated by legislative and policy changes under consideration by the Trump Administration. For example, the new administration has expressed an interest in authorizing and/or directing the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Service or other agencies of the U.S. government to negotiate prices for products covered by Medicare directly with pharmaceutical companies. If this were to occur, especially for wet AMD products, where a large portion of the patient population is elderly and is therefore covered by Medicare, there could be significant downward pressure on prices charged, not only for patients covered by Medicare, but also for patients covered by private insurers who may follow the government’s lead on price. Adoption of price controls and cost–containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third–party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost–effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the 
34

profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low–priced and high–priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
Healthcare Law and Regulation
Healthcare providers and third–party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third–party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti–kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

• | the federal Anti–Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti–kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non–governmental third–party payors, including private insurers.

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Health Care Reform
There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the health care system in the United States. In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drug agents or biologic agents, which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government health care programs;


• | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;


• | extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;


• | new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;


• | creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, if and when impaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription products; and


• | establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription product spending.

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that started in 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional congressional action is taken, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to 
36

five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of products under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. 
These healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices or the frequency with which products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. In May 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation known as the American Health Care Act of 2017. Thereafter, the Senate Republicans introduced and then updated a bill to replace the ACA known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. The Senate Republicans also introduced legislation to repeal the ACA without companion legislation to replace it, and a “skinny” version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. In addition, the Senate considered proposed healthcare reform legislation known as the Graham-Cassidy bill. None of these measures was passed by the U.S. Senate. 
The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. In January 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In October 2017, the President signed a second Executive Order allowing for the use of association health plans and short-term health insurance, which may provide fewer health benefits than the plans sold through the ACA exchanges. At the same time, the Administration announced that it will discontinue the payment of cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies until Congress approves the appropriation of funds for such CSR payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA. A bipartisan bill to appropriate funds for CSR payments was introduced in the Senate, but the future of that bill is uncertain.
More recently, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA, during the next congressional session.
Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of products under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control costs. At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription product and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.
