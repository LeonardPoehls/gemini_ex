Item 1.    Business
NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
   General
 We are a Delaware master limited partnership. Our common units trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol TCP. We were formed by TransCanada Corporation and its subsidiaries (TransCanada) in 1998 to acquire, own and participate in the management of energy infrastructure businesses in North America. Our pipeline systems transport natural gas in the U.S. 
 We are managed by our General Partner, which is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of TransCanada. At December 31, 2016, subsidiaries of TransCanada own approximately 25.3 percent of our common units, 100 percent of our Class B units, 100 percent of our incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and an effective two percent general partner interest in us. See Part II, Item 5. "Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" for more information regarding TransCanada's ownership in us. 
   Recent Business Developments
 On April 21, 2016, the board of directors of our General Partner declared the Partnership's first quarter 2016 cash distribution in the amount of $0.89 per common unit which was paid on May 13, 2016 to unitholders of record as of May 2, 2016. The declared distribution to our General Partner included a $1.2 million distribution for its effective two percent general partner interest and an IDR payment amounting to $0.9 million for a total distribution of $2.1 million. 
 On July 21, 2016, the board of directors of our General Partner declared the Partnership's second quarter 2016 cash distribution in the amount of $0.94 per common unit which was paid on August 12, 2016 to unitholders of record as of August 1, 2016. The declared distribution reflected a $0.05 per common unit increase to the first quarter 2016 quarterly distribution. The declared distribution to our General Partner included a $1.3 million distribution for its effective two percent general partner interest and an IDR payment amounting to $1.9 million for a total distribution of $3.2 million. 
 On October 20, 2016, the board of directors of our General Partner declared the Partnership's third quarter 2016 cash distribution in the amount of $0.94 per common unit which was paid on November 14, 2016 to unitholders of record as of November 1, 2016. The declared distribution to our General Partner included a $1.3 million distribution for its effective two percent general partner interest and an IDR payment amounting to $2.0 million for a total distribution of $3.3 million. 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2016    7

  On January 23, 2017, the board of directors of our General Partner declared the Partnership's fourth quarter 2016 cash distribution in the amount of $0.94 per common unit payable on February 14, 2017 to unitholders of record as of February 2, 2016. The declared distribution to our General Partner included a $1.3 million distribution for its effective two percent general partner interest and an IDR payment of $2.0 million for a total distribution of $3.3 million. 
 Incentive distributions are paid to our General Partner if quarterly cash distributions on the common units exceed levels specified in the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (Partnership Agreement). See Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Cash Distribution Policy of the Partnership" for further information regarding IDRs. 
 PNGTS  On January 1, 2016, the Partnership acquired a 49.9 percent interest in PNGTS from a subsidiary of TransCanada. The total purchase price of the PNGTS Acquisition was $228 million and consisted of $193 million in cash (including the final purchase price adjustment of $5 million) and the assumption of $35 million in proportional PNGTS debt. 
 ATM program  On August 5, 2016, the Partnership entered into a $400 million Equity Distribution Agreement (EDA) with five financial institutions (the Managers). Pursuant to the terms of the $400 Million EDA, the Partnership may sell from time to time through the Managers, as the Partnership's sales agents, the Partnership's common units at an aggregate offering price up to $400,000,000. Sales of the common units will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions through the NYSE at market prices, in connection with reverse inquiry transactions or as otherwise agreed by the Partnership and one or more of the Managers. The common units will be issued pursuant to the Partnership's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-211907), which was declared effective by the SEC on August 4, 2016. 
 During 2016, we sold 3,137,382 common units at an average price of $53.49 for total net proceeds of approximately $167 million, including our General Partner's proportionate equity contribution of approximately $3.4 million to maintain its two percent effective interest, net of approximately $1.7 million of commissions to our sales agents. 
 Of these common units, an aggregate 1,619,631 common units may be deemed to have been unregistered sales of securities. 
 See Note 9 of the Partnership's consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules" for further information regarding the rescission of common units. 
 Tuscarora Rate Case  On January 21, 2016, FERC issued an Order initiating an investigation pursuant to Section 5 of the NGA to determine whether Tuscarora's existing rates for jurisdictional services were just and reasonable. On September 22, 2016, FERC approved the settlement (Tuscarora Settlement) Tuscarora made with its customers that resolved the Section 5 rate review initiated by FERC in January 2016. Under the terms of the Tuscarora Settlement, Tuscarora's system-wide unit rate initially decreased by 17 percent, effective August 1, 2016. Unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement, this rate will remain in effect until July 31, 2019, after which time the unit rate will decrease by an additional seven percent from August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2022. The settlement does not contain a rate moratorium and requires Tuscarora to file to establish new rates no later than August 1, 2022. While this new rate structure reduced Tuscarora's cash flows beginning August 1, 2016, the achievement of rate certainty helps ensure predictable cash flows from this pipeline system.

Our goal is to maximize distributable cash flows over the long-term through efficient utilization of our pipeline systems and appropriate business strategies, while maintaining a commitment to safe and reliable operations. 

   Understanding the Natural Gas Pipeline Business
 Natural gas pipelines move natural gas from major sources of supply or upstream pipelines to downstream pipelines or locations or markets that use natural gas to meet their energy needs. Pipeline systems include meter stations that record how much natural gas comes on to the pipeline and how much exits at the delivery locations; compressor stations that act like pumps to move the large volumes of natural gas along the pipeline; and the pipelines themselves that transport natural gas under high pressure. 
 Regulation, rates and cost recovery 
 Interstate natural gas pipelines are regulated by FERC. FERC approves the construction of new pipeline facilities and regulates aspects of our business including the maximum rates that are allowed to be charged. Maximum rates are based on operating costs, which include allowances for operating and maintenance costs, income and property taxes, interest on debt, depreciation expense to recover invested capital and a return on the capital invested. Although FERC regulates maximum rates for services, interstate natural gas pipelines frequently face competition and therefore may choose to discount their services in order to compete. 
 Because FERC rate reviews are periodic and not annual, actual revenues and costs typically vary from those projected during the rate case. If revenues no longer provide a reasonable opportunity to recover costs, a pipeline can file with FERC for a determination of new rates, subject to any moratoriums in effect. FERC also has the authority to initiate a review to determine whether a pipeline's rates of return are just and reasonable. Sometimes a settlement or agreement with the pipeline shippers is achieved, which may include mutually beneficial performance incentives. A settlement is ultimately subject to FERC approval. 
 Contracting 
 New pipeline projects are typically supported by long-term contracts. The term of the contracts is dependent on the individual developer's appetite for risk and is a function of expected rates of return, stability and certainty of returns. Transportation contracts expire at varying times and underpin varying amounts of capacity. As existing contracts approach their expiration dates, efforts are made to extend and/or renew the contracts. If market conditions are not favorable at the time of renewal, transportation capacity may remain uncontracted, be contracted at lower rates or be contracted on a shorter-term basis. Unsold capacity may be recontracted if and when market conditions become more favorable. The ability to extend and/or renew expiring contracts and the terms of such subsequent contracts will depend upon the overall commercial environment for natural gas transportation and consumption. 
 Business environment 
 The North American natural gas pipeline network has been developed to connect supply to market. Use and growth of this infrastructure is affected by changes in the location, relative cost of natural gas supply and changing market demand. 
 The map below shows the location of the North American basins in relation to our pipeline systems together with those of our General Partner, TransCanada Corporation. 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2016    9

  
Supply 
 Natural gas is primarily transported from producing regions and, in limited circumstances, from liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facilities to market hubs or interconnects for distribution to natural gas consumers. Recent development of shale and other unconventional gas reserves has resulted in increases in overall North American natural gas production and economically recoverable reserves. 
 There has been an increase in production from the development of shale gas reserves that are located close to traditional markets, particularly in the Northeastern U.S. This has increased the number of supply choices for natural gas consumers resulting in changes to historical natural gas pipeline flow patterns. 
 The supply of natural gas in North America is expected to continue increasing significantly over the next decade and over the long-term for a number of reasons, including the following: 
  
use of technology, including horizontal drilling in combination with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, is allowing companies to access unconventional resources economically. This is increasing the technically accessible resource base of existing and emerging gas basins; and 

application of these technologies to existing oil fields where further recovery of the existing resource is now possible. There is often associated gas discovered in the exploration and production of liquids-rich hydrocarbons (for example the Bakken oil fields), which also contributes to an increase in the overall gas supply for North America. 

 Other factors that can influence the overall level of natural gas supply in North America include: 
  
the price of natural gas  low prices in North America may increase demand but reduce drilling activities that in turn diminish production levels, particularly in dry natural gas fields where the extra revenue generated from the associated liquids is not available. High natural gas prices may encourage higher drilling activities but may decrease the level of demand; 

producer portfolio diversification  large producers often diversify their portfolios by developing several basins but this is influenced by actual costs to develop the resource as well as economic access to markets and cost of pipeline transportation services. Basin-on-basin competition impacts the extent and timing of a resource development that, in turn, drives changing dynamics for pipeline capacity demand; and 

 10    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2016





regulatory
and public scrutiny  changes in regulations that apply to natural gas production and consumption could impact the cost and
pace of development of natural gas in North America. 

Demand 
 The natural gas pipeline business ultimately depends on a shipper's demand for pipeline capacity and the price paid for that capacity. Demand for pipeline capacity is influenced by, among other things, supply and market competition, economic activity, weather conditions, natural gas pipeline and storage competition and the price of alternative fuels. 
 The growing supply of natural gas has resulted in relatively low natural gas prices in North America which has supported increased demand for natural gas particularly in the following areas: 
  
natural gas-fired power generation; 

petrochemical and industrial facilities; 

the production of Alberta's oil sands, although new greenfield projects that have not begun construction may be delayed in the current oil price environment; and 

exports to Mexico to fuel electric power generation facilities; and 

exports from North America to global markets through a number of proposed LNG export facilities. 

 Commodity Prices 
 In general, the profitability of the natural gas pipelines business is not directly tied to commodity prices given we are a transporter of the commodity and the transportation costs are not tied to the price of natural gas. However, the cyclical supply and demand nature of commodities and its price impact can have a secondary impact on our business where our shippers may choose to accelerate or delay certain projects. This can impact the timing for the demand of transportation services and/or new gas pipeline infrastructure. 
Competition 
 Competition among natural gas pipelines is based primarily on transportation rates and proximity to natural gas supply areas and consuming markets. Changes in supply locations and regional demand have resulted in changes to pipeline flow dynamics. Where pipelines historically transported natural gas from one or two supply sources to their markets under long-term contracts, today many pipelines transport gas in multiple directions and under shorter contract terms. Some pipelines have even reversed their flows in order to adapt to changing sources of supply. Competition among pipelines to attract supply and new or existing markets to their systems has also increased across North America. 
Our Pipeline Systems
 We have four wholly-owned pipelines and equity ownership interests in three natural gas interstate pipeline systems that are collectively designed to transport approximately 9.1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from producing regions and import facilities to market hubs and consuming markets primarily in the Western, Midwestern and Eastern U.S. All of our pipeline systems are operated by subsidiaries of TransCanada. 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2016    11

  Our pipeline systems include: 
  
Pipeline | Length | Description | Ownership
----------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------
GTN | 1,377 miles | Extends between an interconnection near Kingsgate, British Columbia, Canada at the Canadian border to a point near Malin, Oregon at the California border and delivers natural gas to the Pacific Northwest and to California. | 100% 
Bison | 303 miles | Extends from a location near Gillette, Wyoming to Northern Border's pipeline system in North Dakota. Bison can transport natural gas from the Powder River Basin to Midwest markets. | 100% 
North Baja | 86 miles | Extends between an interconnection with the El Paso Natural Gas Company pipeline near Ehrenberg, Arizona and an interconnection with a natural gas pipeline near Ogilby, California on the Mexican border transporting natural gas in the southwest. North Baja is a bi-directional pipeline. | 100% 
Tuscarora | 305 miles | Extends between the GTN pipeline near Malin, Oregon to its terminus near Reno, Nevada and delivers natural gas in northeastern California and northwestern Nevada. | 100% 
Northern Border | 1,412 miles | Extends between the Canadian border near Port of Morgan, Montana to a terminus near North Hayden, Indiana, south of Chicago. Northern Border is capable of receiving natural gas from Canada, the Williston Basin and Rocky Mountain area for deliveries to the Midwest. ONEOK Partners, L.P. owns the remaining 50 percent of Northern Border. | 50%

  The map below shows the location of our pipeline systems. 
 
Customers, Contracting and Demand 
 Our customers are generally large utilities, local distribution companies (LDCs), major natural gas marketers, producing companies and other interstate pipelines, including affiliates. Our pipelines generate revenue by charging rates for transporting natural gas. Natural gas transportation service is provided pursuant to long-term and short-term contracts on a firm or interruptible basis. The majority of our pipeline systems' natural gas transportation services are provided through firm service transportation contracts with a reservation or demand charge that reserves pipeline capacity, regardless of use, for the term of the contract. The revenues associated with capacity reserved under firm service transportation contracts are not subject to fluctuations caused by changing supply and demand conditions, competition or customers. Customers with interruptible service transportation agreements may utilize available capacity after firm service transportation requests are satisfied. 
 Our pipeline systems actively market their available capacity and work closely with customers, including natural gas producers, LDCs, marketers and end users, to ensure our pipelines are offering attractive services and competitive rates. Approximately 74 percent of our long-term contract revenues are with customers who have an investment grade rating or who have provided guarantees from investment grade parties. We have obtained financial assurances as permitted by FERC and our tariffs for the remaining long-term contracts. See Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors." 
 Two of our customers, Anadarko Energy Services Company and Pacific Gas and Electric Company, account for a significant portion of our revenue and comprised 13 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of the Partnership's revenues in 2016. 
 GTN  GTN's revenues are substantially supported by long-term contracts, the majority of which are expiring prior to 2023. These contracts are primarily held by LDCs that historically use a diversified portfolio of transportation options to serve their long-term markets and marketers contracting under a variety of contract terms. We expect GTN to continue to be an important transportation component of these diversified portfolios. Incremental transportation opportunities are based on the difference in value between Western Canadian natural gas supplies and deliveries to Northern California. GTN's rates were established based on its contracted long-term capacity at the time of its last rate case in 2015 and thus ensures full coverage of its cost of service. In 2016, GTN benefited from an increase in the volumes of natural gas it transports as debottlenecking activities occurred on upstream pipeline systems which deliver natural gas to GTN. These upstream activities are expected to continue resulting in additional volumes that could potentially flow onto GTN by November 2018. GTN continues to market its remaining long-term capacity. 
 Northern Border  Northern Border is a highly competitive pipeline system and is fully contracted with its revenues substantially supported by firm transportation contracts through March 2018. Northern Border's contracts include 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2016    13

   renewal rights and expiring contracts have typically been renewed for terms of two years or longer. In addition, Northern Border sells seasonal transportation services which have traditionally been strongest during peak winter months to serve heating demand and peak spring/summer months to serve electric cooling demand and storage injection. 
 Great Lakes  Great Lakes' revenue is derived from shorter-term contracts for short-haul and long-haul transportation. A majority of these contracts are with TransCanada and affiliates on multiple paths across its system. Great Lakes' ability to sell its available and future capacity will depend on future market conditions which are impacted by a number of factors including weather, levels of natural gas in storage, the capacity of upstream and downstream pipelines and the availability and pricing of natural gas supplies. Demand for Great Lakes' services has historically been highest in the summer to fill the natural gas storage complexes in Ontario and Michigan in advance of the upcoming winter season. During the winter, Great Lakes serves peak heating requirements for customers in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and the upper Midwest of the U.S. 
 PNGTS  PNGTS' revenue is primarily from gas utilities, paper mills and electric generation plants throughout New England. Approximately 50 percent of PNGTS' current revenue stream is driven by long-term contracts that expire in 2019 with the remaining 50 percent driven by short-term contracts that are typically renewed on a continuing short-term basis. Long-term contract commitments from the Continent to Coast (C2C) open season are scheduled to begin November 2017 with expiration in 2032 and will replace some expiring short-term contracts. The C2C expansion is expected to bring additional, diverse natural gas supply options to markets in New England and Atlantic Canada. The shippers on the C2C project signed binding Precedent Agreements (PAs) which contain conditions precedent in favor of both PNGTS and the shippers. The majority of the shippers' conditions have been met. Under the PAs, PNGTS is required to obtain an increase in its FERC-certificated capacity and Presidential gas import permit. PNGTS has applied for these permits and they are expected to be approved in 2017. PNGTS is continuing to market its remaining long-term capacity and to pursue expansion opportunities. 
 Bison  Natural gas is currently not flowing in response to the recent relative cost advantage of WCSB-sourced gas versus Rockies production. Bison has not experienced a decrease in its revenue as it is fully contracted on a ship-or-pay basis through January of 2021. 
 Other Pipelines  North Baja and Tuscarora revenues are substantially supported by long-term contracts through 2020. 
 Competition 
 Overall, our pipeline systems generate a substantial portion of their cash flow from long-term firm contracts for transportation services and are therefore insulated from competitive factors during the terms of the contracts. If these long-term contracts are not renewed at their expiration, our pipeline systems face competitive pressures which influence contract renewals and rates charged for transportation services. 
 Three of our pipeline systems, GTN, Northern Border, and Great Lakes, compete with each other for WCSB natural gas supply as well as with other pipelines, including TransCanada's Mainline system, the Alliance pipeline and the Westcoast pipeline. Northern Border and Great Lakes compete in their respective market areas for natural gas supplies from other basins as well, such as the Rocky Mountain area, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, Utica and Marcellus basins. GTN primarily competes with pipelines supplying natural gas into California and Pacific Northwest markets. 
 Bison competes for deliveries with other pipelines that transport natural gas supplies within and away from the Rocky Mountain area. 
 North Baja's southbound pipeline capacity competes with deliveries of LNG received at the Costa Azul terminal in Mexico. When LNG shipments are received at Costa Azul, North Baja's northbound capacity competes with pipelines that deliver Rocky Mountain area, Permian and San Juan basin natural gas into the Southern California area. 
 Tuscarora competes for deliveries primarily into the northern Nevada natural gas market with natural gas from the Rocky Mountain area. 
 14    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2016

  PNGTS connects with TQM at the Canadian border and shares facilities with the Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline from Westbrook, Maine to a connection with the Tennessee Gas Pipeline System near Boston, Massachusetts. PNGTS competes with LNG supplies and gas flows from Canada and with LNG delivered into Boston. Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Algonquin Gas Transmission also compete with PNGTS for gas deliveries into New England markets. 
   Relationship with TransCanada
 TransCanada is the indirect parent of our General Partner and at December 31, 2016 owns, through its subsidiaries, approximately 25.3 percent of our common units, 100 percent of our Class B units, 100 percent of our IDRs and an effective two percent general partner interest in us. TransCanada is a major energy infrastructure company, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and NYSE, with more than 65 years of experience in the responsible development and reliable operation of energy infrastructure in North America. TransCanada's business is primarily focused on natural gas and oil transmission and power generation services. TransCanada consists of investments in 56,900 miles natural gas pipelines, 2,700 miles of wholly-owned oil pipelines and 653 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity. TransCanada also owns or has interests in over 10,700 megawatts of power generation. 
 TransCanada operates our pipeline systems and, in some cases, contracts for pipeline capacity. We have purchased assets from TransCanada and jointly participated with TransCanada in acquiring assets from third parties, including acquisitions that we would have been unable to pursue on our own. TransCanada views the Partnership as a core element of its strategy and considers the dropdown of assets into the Partnership as an effective financing option as it executes its capital growth program, subject to actual funding needs and market conditions. There can be no assurance as to when and on what terms these assets will be offered to the Partnership. See Part III, Item 13. "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence" for more information on our relationship with TransCanada. 
   Government Regulation
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
 All of our pipeline systems are regulated by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and Energy Policy Act of 2005, which gives FERC jurisdiction to regulate virtually all aspects of our business, including: 
  
transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce; 

rates and charges; 

terms of service and service contracts with customers, including counterparty credit support requirements; 

certification and construction of new facilities; 

extension or abandonment of service and facilities; 

accounts and records; 

depreciation and amortization policies; 

acquisition and disposition of facilities; 

initiation and discontinuation of services; and 

standards of conduct for business relations with certain affiliates. 

 Our pipeline systems' operating revenues are determined based on rate options stated in our tariffs which are approved by FERC. Tariffs specify the general terms and conditions for pipeline transportation service including the rates that may be charged. FERC, either through hearing a rate case or as a result of approving a negotiated settlement, approves the maximum rates permissible for transportation service on a pipeline system which are designed to recover the pipeline's cost-based investment, operating expenses and a reasonable return for its investors. Once maximum rates are set, a 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2016    15

  pipeline system is not permitted to adjust the maximum rates to reflect changes in costs or contract demand until new rates are approved by FERC. Pipelines are permitted to charge rates lower than the maximum tariff rates in order to compete. As a result, earnings and cash flows of each pipeline system depend on a number of factors including costs incurred, contracted capacity and transportation path, the volume of natural gas transported and rates charged. 
 Regulatory and Rate Proceedings 
 GTN  GTN operates under rates established pursuant to a settlement approved by FERC in June 2015. Beginning in January 2016, GTN's rates decreased by 10 percent and will continue in effect through December 31, 2019. Unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement, GTN's rates will decrease an additional eight percent for the period January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 when GTN will be required to establish new rates. 
 Northern Border  Northern Border has a FERC-approved settlement agreement which established maximum long-term transportation rates and charges on the Northern Border system effective January 1, 2013 and requires Northern Border to file for new rates no later than January 1, 2018. 
 Bison  Bison continues to operate under the rates approved by FERC in connection with Bison's initial construction and has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding. 
 Great Lakes  Great Lakes operates under rates established pursuant to a settlement approved by FERC in November 2013. Under the settlement, Great Lakes is required to file for new rates to be effective no later than January 1, 2018. 
 North Baja  North Baja continues to operate under the rates approved by FERC and has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding. On January 6, 2017, North Baja notified FERC that current market conditions do not support the replacement of the compression that was temporarily abandoned in 2013 and requested authorization to permanently abandon two compressor units and a nominal volume of unsubscribed firm capacity. The requested abandonments will not have any impact on existing firm transportation service. 
 Tuscarora  On January 21, 2016, FERC issued an Order initiating an investigation pursuant to Section 5 of the NGA to determine whether Tuscarora's existing rates for jurisdictional services are just and reasonable. On September 22, 2016, FERC approved the settlement (Tuscarora Settlement) Tuscarora made with its customers that resolved the Section 5 rate review initiated by FERC in January 2016. Under the terms of the Tuscarora Settlement, Tuscarora's system-wide unit rate initially decreased by 17 percent, effective August 1, 2016. Unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement, this rate will remain in effect until July 31, 2019, after which time the unit rate will decrease by an additional seven percent from August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2022. The settlement does not contain a rate moratorium and requires Tuscarora to file to establish new rates no later than August 1, 2022. 
 PNGTS  PNGTS continues to operate under the rates approved by FERC in PNGTS' most recent rate proceeding, effective December 1, 2010. PNGTS has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding. 
Environmental 
 Our pipelines are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges and waste management. Such laws and regulations generally require natural gas pipelines to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits and other approvals required for construction and operations. Certain violations of environmental laws can result in the imposition of strict, joint and several liability. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action requirements, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in the permitting or performance of projects and/or the issuance of orders enjoining future operations in affected areas. 
 The following is a discussion of some of the applicable environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business. 
  
Solid Wastes and Hazardous Substance and Wastes Statutes  The operations of our pipeline systems are subject to federal and analogous state statutes that regulate the handling, management, storage and disposal of solid wastes, 

 16    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2016

  
including
hazardous wastes and hazardous substances. These include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act the Solid Waste Disposal Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act, on the federal level and comparable state statutes. These statutes subject our operations to rigorous waste management and disposal practices to ensure compliance. In addition, the
improper disposal or a release of wastes or hazardous substance could result in the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations. 

  
The Clean Air Act (CAA)  The CAA and comparable state laws regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including compressor stations, and impose various monitoring, reporting, and in some cases, control requirements. Such laws and regulations may require pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain facilities expected to produce air pollutants or result in an increase of existing air pollutants. Such facilities must also comply with air permits containing various emission and operational limitations, or requiring the use of emission control or abatement technologies, which could result in the imposition of substantial costs on our operations. 

Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)  The TSCA addresses the production, importation, use and disposal of specific chemicals and provides the EPA with authority to require reporting, record-keeping and testing requirements, and restrictions relating to chemical substances and mixtures. These include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos, radon and lead-based paint. 

The Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA)  The CWA, OPA and comparable state laws impose strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into or adjacent to state waters and waters of the U.S. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is generally prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or a delegated state or federal agency. The CWA and federal regulations also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The EPA released a final rule in May 2015 that attempted to clarify federal jurisdiction under the CWA over waters of the U.S. This interpretation by the EPA may constitute an expansion of federal jurisdiction over waters of the U.S. Implementation of the rule has been stayed nationwide, and in January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court accepted review of the rule to determine whether jurisdiction over the challenge to the rule rests with the federal district or appellate courts. Litigation surrounding the rule is ongoing. To the extent the rule expands the scope of the CWA's jurisdiction, pipeline construction and expansion projects could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. 

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)  Natural gas transportation activities over federally-managed land or involving federal approval can be subject to review under NEPA, or analogous state requirements. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior or FERC, to evaluate governmental agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that addresses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that is made available for public review and comment. The current activities of our pipeline systems, as well as any proposed plans for future activities, on federal lands are subject to the requirements of NEPA in connection with any new approval that is required for construction, operation or use on or of federal lands. NEPA reviews can take a significant amount of time and are subject to challenge and appeal by environmental groups, who have frequently used the NEPA process to challenge pipeline construction projects over the past several years, and therefore, have the potential to delay current and future natural gas transportation activities.

The Endangered Species Act (ESA)  The ESA restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. The presence of threatened or endangered species, including the designation of previously unidentified or threatened species, could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.

     We have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring material costs to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations. We have not accrued for any environmental liabilities. 
 Greenhouse Gas 
 Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date, but the EPA has determined that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment and subsequently has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews regarding GHGs for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of conventional pollutant emissions. The EPA has also promulgated regulations requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from, among other sources, certain onshore natural gas transmission and storage facilities, including gathering and boosting facilities, completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines between compressor stations in the U.S. on an annual basis. Recent federal rulemakings have focused on the emission of methane. 
 Additionally, while the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, in the absence of any significant activity by Congress in recent years to adopt such legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs. For example, Washington, one of the states in which we operate, has implemented a carbon tax that has the potential to impact our operations; however, at this time we do not expect the impact of Washington's carbon tax on our operations to be material. 
 On an international level in December 2015, the U.S. joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and "represent a progression" in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. The agreement was signed by the U.S. in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016. The U.S. is one of more than 120 countries having ratified or otherwise consented to the agreement; however the agreement does not set binding emission reduction targets. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that exploration and production operators produce, some of whom are our customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our natural gas transportation services. 
 Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such changes were to occur, it is uncertain what effect they might have on our financial condition and operations. 
 Safety 
 Our pipeline systems are subject to federal pipeline safety statutes, such as the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the PSI Act), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, and Enforcement Act of 2006 (the PIPES Act), the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act) and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act), as well as regulations promulgated and administered by the PHMSA. The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities. Pursuant to the authority granted under the NGPSA, PHMSA has promulgated regulations governing pipeline design, installation, testing, maximum operating pressures, pipeline patrols and leak surveys, minimum depth requirements and emergency procedures, as well as other matters intended to ensure adequate protection for the public and to prevent accidents and failures. The PSI Act established mandatory inspections for all U.S. natural gas transportation pipelines,

  and some gathering lines in high consequence areas (HCAs), which are areas where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences, including high population areas. The PIPES Act required mandatory inspections for certain natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs and required that rulemaking be issued for, among other things, pipeline control room management. Pursuant to the authority granted under the NGPSA, as amended, PHMSA has established a series of rules requiring pipeline operators, such as us, to develop and implement integrity management programs for natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs that require the performance of frequent inspections and other precautionary measures. PHMSA may assess penalties for violations of these and other requirements imposed by its regulations. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act also increases the maximum penalty for violation of pipeline safety regulations from $100,000 to $200,000 per violation per day of violation and also from $1 million to $2 million for a related series of violations. 
 The ongoing laws could cause our pipeline systems to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure their continued safe and reliable operation and to comply with the federal pipeline safety statutes and regulations. 
 Additional rulemakings regarding pipeline safety is likely. In June 2016, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act was passed, extending PHMSA's statutory mandate through 2019 and, among other things, requiring PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Act and developing new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 22, 2018. The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act as further amended by the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, as well as any implementation of PHMSA rules or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance by PHMSA or any other state agencies with respect thereto, could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects, conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, or result in a temporary or permanent reduction in maximum allowable operating pressure, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines, any or all of which could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could be significant, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 There can be no assurance that future compliance with the requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our pipeline systems and the Partnership's financial position, operational costs, cash flow and our ability to maintain current distribution levels to the extent the increased costs are not recoverable through rates. 
 From time to time, despite compliance with applicable rules and regulations, our pipelines may experience incidents that result in leaks and ruptures that may impact the surrounding population and environment. This may result in enforcement by regulatory agencies that may seek civil and/or criminal fines and penalties, and could require our pipelines to conduct testing of the pipeline system or upgrade segments of a pipeline unrelated to the incident which costs may not be covered by insurance or recoverable through rate increases. 
 Other 
 On November 19, 2015, the Bureau of Indian Affairs published a final rule, Rights-of-Way on Indian Land; Final Rule (25 CFR 169) with the intended goal to update and streamline the process for obtaining BIA grants of rights-of-way (ROW) over and across tribal and individual Indian allotted land. The effective date of the rule is December 21, 2015. While many of the provisions simplify and expedite the process of negotiating and obtaining a ROW, certain provisions provide increased tribal authority over ROWs. As a result, tribes will have greater authority to enforce tribal laws as it relates to tax obligations for improvements, increased notification and consent for financing and bonding requirements for restoration. The rule also sets forth additional requirements concerning real property that may affect new and existing agreements. 
 On December 15, 2016 FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry Regarding the Commission's Policy for Recovery of Income Tax Costs (Docket No. PL17-1-000) requesting Initial Comments regarding how to address any double recovery resulting from FERC's current income tax allowance and rate of return policies. Initial Comments are due to FERC by March 8, 2017 and Reply Comments by April 7, 2017.
