Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Union Bridge Holdings Limited (the “Company” or “we”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 6, 2014 under the name Costo, Inc. to engage in the business of distributing automobile parts and components necessary for the maintenance and repair of automobiles and specialty equipment, including construction and road machinery, principally in China, Europe and certain Commonwealth of Independent States countries (Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan). We changed our name to Union Bridge Holdings Limited on May 23, 2016 in connection with our expanded business plan under which we determined to expand operations into the health care industry. We never achieved any revenues from our automobile and specialty equipment business and during the fourth quarter of 2017 we determined to discontinue that area of business.
 
Throughout this Annual Report references to the Company also include reference to our wholly owned subsidiaries, First Channel Limited (“First Channel”), a British Virgin Islands company formed on March 12, 2016, Windsor Honour Limited (“Windsor”), a British Virgin Islands company formed on October 30, 2017, Phoenix Creation Global Limited (“Phoenix”), a British Virgin Islands company formed on October 26, 2017, First Channel’s wholly owned subsidiary, Union Beam Investment Limited (“Union Beam”), a Hong Kong company formed on February 18, 2016, Union Beam’s wholly owned subsidiary Qianhai Lianqiao Investment Consulting (Shenzen) Company Limited, a Chinese company formed on February 2, 2018, Phoenix’s wholly owned subsidiary, Union Care Investment Limited (“Union Care”) a Hong Kong company formed on February 13, 2018.
 
Since May 23, 2016 we have taken steps to position our company to operate in two segments of the health care industry: (i) as a distributor in Asia of technologically advanced medical equipment devices and other lifestyle products and services for the elderly, including, but not limited to wheelchairs and telemedic devices, and (ii) as an operator of senior care facilities in Asia, including, but not limited to Hong Kong, China and Thailand.
 
We intend to grow primarily through mergers and acquisitions. Prospective targets are companies in the biotech industry, healthcare hospitality and service providers and manufacturers and suppliers of innovative healthcare products and devices, including health supplements. Our intended expansion will require us to raise additional working capital. We do not have any present commitments from any potential providers of funds.
 
The medical device industry in Asia offers distributors many opportunities. While many sectors are affected by economic downturns, the growth of medical technology remains largely undeterred due to its indispensable nature within an aging population. We intend to compete in this market based upon product quality and cost effectiveness. Competitive product pricing combined with an evolving product line is expected to provide us with the opportunity to efficiently operate in designated territories. We will need to engage local sales distribution channels in connection with our medical products and devices. Our present management does not have experience in the sale of such products and devices.
 
The core elements of our senior health care facility strategy are to:
 
 
· | Acquire, develop, lease, own and/or manage a diversified portfolio of quality, high level, healthcare properties across multiple geographic locations, initially in Hong Kong, China and Thailand; Align ourselves with leading healthcare companies, operators and service providers, which, over the long term, should result in higher net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Establish name recognition in the geographic areas in which we operate. 


We intend to operate in the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry in Asia. Our goal is to be a first choice in senior living by being a most trusted and effective senior living provider. Our senior housing facilities are intended to provide personalized care tailored to fit individual preferences and needs while treating residents with dignity and encouraging independence. Our community and service offerings are intended to combine housing, health care, hospitality and ancillary services. Our senior living communities will offer residents a supportive home-like setting, assistance with activities of daily living and, in certain communities, licensed skilled nursing services. By providing residents with a range of service options as their needs change, we expect to provide greater continuity of care, enabling seniors to “age-in-place”, which we believe enables them to maintain residency with us for longer periods of time. The ability of residents to age-in-place is also beneficial to our residents and their families who are concerned with care decisions for their elderly relatives. With our planned platform of a range of community and service offerings, we believe that we will be positioned to take advantage of favorable demographic trends over time.

We also intend to offer in-home services for the elderly, including housing care, meal preparation, feeding, bathing and dressing services. In addition, we intend to establish community centers at which home-based seniors can receive medical support and rehabilitation training. Our present management does not have experience in the operation of senior care facilities. In connection with this segment, we intend to partner with experienced operators of senior care facilities.
 
Our proposed healthcare business is at an early stage of development. No assurances can be given that we will obtain capital as and when needed or that, if obtained, we will successfully develop our healthcare business.
 
Recent Developments
 
Distribution of Medical and Lifestyle Equipment and Services
 
On November 3, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, First Channel Limited (“FCL”), entered into two binding Memoranda of Understanding (the “MOUs”) with G Medical Innovations Asia Limited (“G Medical Asia”), a Hong Kong company which develops and markets clinical and consumer medical-grade health monitoring solutions, for the distribution of G Medical Asia’s Prizma device (“Prizma”) and its related services in India and Taiwan. Prizma is a small “telemedic” device that neatly encases a regular smart-phone making it a constant companion of the user. With Prizma, consumers are able to record their vital medical parameters such as ECG, heart rate and rhythm, oxygen saturation levels in the body, body temperature and overall stress levels. The recorded data is then transmitted over the internet to a special G Medical center, where they are interpreted by G Medical and users are alerted if any abnormalities are observed. Prizma has US Food and Drug Administration clearance and European Union CE Mark approval. The MOUs obligate the parties to hold good faith negotiations in order to execute binding definitive agreements. G Medical Asia is a subsidiary of G Medical Innovations Holdings Limited, a company whose stock trades on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX:GMV). The monitoring service through the G Medical center has yet to be established. We are presently conducting additional diligence on Prizma and will need to apply for licenses and other governmental approvals prior to any distribution and sale of Prizma. There can be no guaranty that definitive agreements pursuant to the MOUs will be successfully negotiated and executed.
 
On December 21, 2017, FCL signed an Official Distributor Contract (the “Contract”) with Changzhou Airwheel Technology Co., Ltd. (“Airwheel”) one of the world’s leading smart transportation device manufacturers. Thereunder, FCL was appointed as one of Airwheel’s overseas wheelchair distributors in Hong Kong for a period of three years from the date of the contract with exclusivity for the first year. Airwheel designs and manufactures state of the art wheelchairs with certain artificial intelligence features primarily for the use of the elderly. Pursuant to the contract, FCL will also receive priority in the distribution of any future products that are launched by Airwheel. The Contract covers Airwheel’s H3, H8, A6, A6S and D3 models.
 
We have not yet purchased or sold any Prizma devices or Airwheel wheelchairs other than the samples purchased for marketing and promotion purpose.
 
Senior Care Facilities
 
We are presently seeking acquisition opportunities to fulfill our senior care facility vision. In February 2018, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding , through an agent, with Japan Genki Group (“Genki”), a well-known senior care group based in Japan, as a strategic partner in Asia to operate senior care facilities and provide senior care services in Thailand and Hong Kong.

As of December 31, 2016 Genki was operating 79 senior care facilities in Japan and several senior care centers in Shanghai, Taiwan and Thailand. Genki’s senior care centers offer a wide range of services. Genki also operates a training school for nursing practitioners. Many of the markets in which we intend to operate are experiencing nursing shortages and the availability of trained nursing practitioners through such training school is expected to help us address our nursing needs.

Our first senior care facility is expected to be established on a property of approximately 4,250 sq. meters in Chang Mai, Thailand. Our subsidiary, Windsor Honour Limited (“WHL”), has entered into a Binding Heads of Agreement to enter into a cooperative venture with the owner of the land parcel. The facility is proposed to have four blocks, each with eight floors, and house approximately 400 residents. The parties will negotiate in good faith toward definitive agreements regarding the project. WHL would lease the land and be the developer of the project and would own the buildings on the site. WHL would have full control of the design and supervision of the construction of the project, as well as daily operations and management of the project. The land owner would be responsible for obtaining necessary construction, operation and other permits for the project and would provide necessary liaison with government officials. Total investment in the project for development and construction is estimated to be approximately 200 million Thai Baht (approximately US$6.4 million at current exchange rates), for which WHL would be responsible to obtain financing. WHL would also be responsible for arranging financing of operating costs until they can be funded from operations. The project would lease the land for 90 years with automatic renewals, each for 30 years. The total rent for the first 90 years would be 10 million Thai Baht (approximately US$320,000 at current exchange rates). In addition to the rent, WHL may consider a discretionary bonus to the land owner (with details to be agreed in the definitive agreements). 
 
Upon signing definitive agreements, WHL will pay 2 million Thai Baht (approximately US$64,300 at current exchange rates) as a deposit to the land owner within 90 days, which will be refundable if the development plan for the land as a senior nursing home facility has not been approved by the competent government authority within one year, or if before that date such authority has definitively denied the application for the development plan upon the request of WHL. Otherwise, the deposit will be applied to the rent for the land.
 
We believe that co-operative development with Genki and Beijing Yi Yue will complement both side strengths and bring mutual benefits. No assurances can be given however that we will raise the capital required to fund such development or that definitive agreements pursuant to the Memorandums of Understanding will be successfully negotiated and executed.
 
Industry and Market Overview
 
The healthcare industry in Asia is expected to grow by 11.1% in 2018, representing one of the fastest growing regions in the world. This positive growth is fueled by the increasing adoption of technology, innovative healthcare access programs and the delivery of care outside of traditional hospital settings. Frost & Sullivan estimates that the Asian healthcare industry will grow to US$517 billion in 2018.
 
The world’s aging population has received growing attention in recent years bringing the issue of the need for quality elder care options to the forefront. As the elderly population grows at an accelerating rate, many businesses now view elder care as a “sunrise industry” which can offer attractive returns for investors. Today, growth in senior living market presents both tremendous opportunities and challenges.
 
The senior living industry is generally highly fragmented and characterized by numerous local and regional operators. We believe that a number of trends will contribute to the continued growth of the senior living industry in coming years. As a result of scientific and medical breakthroughs over the past 30 years, seniors are living longer. Due to demographic trends, and continuing advances in science, nutrition and healthcare, the senior population will continue to grow, and we expect the demand for senior living services to continue to increase in future years. There is a growing consumer awareness among seniors and their families concerning the types of services provided by senior living operators, which has further contributed to the demand for senior living services
 
Challenges in this industry include increased regulation of the assisted living and skilled nursing sectors. The regulatory environment continues to intensify in the number and types of laws and regulations affecting this industry, accompanied by increased enforcement activity by governmental officials.

Competition
 
Our competition includes other distributors of technologically advanced medical equipment and other lifestyle products and services for the elderly and operators of senior care facilities. Some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, marketing and human resources than we do. Our competitors may undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, including Internet based advertisements, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies that may allow them to build larger customer and distribution bases than ours. Our competitor’s products and services may achieve greater market acceptance than ours.
Customers
 
We have no customers and have not achieved any operating revenues to date. We do not expect to achieve revenues from our medical and lifestyle equipment and service business or our senior care facilities business until the second half of 2018, at the earliest. We do not expect a single or small group of customers to account for a substantial portion of our revenues.
Employees
 
At April 2, 2018 we have five employees, including our three executive officers, a marketing manager, an accountant and an administrative clerk. None of our employees are represented by a union.
Government Regulation
 
The healthcare industry in Asia and elsewhere is highly regulated at the local, regional and national level and is subject to evolving standards. Healthcare laws, rules and regulations require compliance with establish standards and are intended to provide safe healthcare to the general public. The costs of compliance with such rules and regulation can be significant.
Share Purchase Agreement
 
On February 18, 2016, Yuhua Xu, the controlling shareholder, Chief Executive Officer and sole director of the Company, entered into and closed on a Share Purchase Agreement with Mary Ho, Rudolf Novotny, Shan Ho, Lily Ho and Moana Ho (each a “Purchaser” and collectively, the “Purchasers”) whereby the Purchasers purchased a total of 7,990,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”) from Yuhua Xu, for an aggregate price of $223,720. The Shares acquired represent approximately 74.53% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.
 
Concurrently with the closing of the Share Purchase Agreement, Yuhua Xu, resigned as an officer and director of the Company and Moana Ho was appointed President and Chairman of the Board of Directors and Hui Zhou was appointed as Chief Financial Officer and Director.

Change in Fiscal Year End
 
On May 23 ,2016 we changed our fiscal year end from November 30 to December 31.
 
Available Information
 
We make available, free of charge, or through our Internet website, at www.ughl-us.com, our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Our Internet website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be, and are not, incorporated into this Annual Report.
 
Our reports, registration statements and other information can be inspected on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and such information can also be inspected, and copies ordered, at the public reference facilities maintained by the SEC at the following location: 100 F Street NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information regarding the operation of the SEC’s public reference facilities may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
 
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

· | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
· | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.


We may take advantage of these provisions through December 31, 2020. If certain events occur prior to December 31, 2020, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to December 31, 2020.
 
We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. We have taken advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this registration statement and may elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
 
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure available to smaller reporting companies.

Our corporate headquarters are located at Room 1205, 12/F, Harcourt House,39 Gloucester Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong and our telephone number is +852 2468 3012. Our filings with the Securities Exchange Commission, or SEC, are available free of charge through the SEC website.
