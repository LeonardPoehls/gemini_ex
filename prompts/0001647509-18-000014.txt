Item 1. Business
General
Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. (with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) principally engages in the operation, development, management and acquisition of office, apartment and retail real estate and land throughout the United States. The Company had approximately $8.1 billion of consolidated assets in 20 states and the District of Columbia at December 31, 2017. The Company’s core markets include Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and the greater metropolitan areas of New York City, San Francisco and Washington D.C. The Company has regional offices in Boston, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and the Company’s corporate headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio.
The Company is organized around real estate operations, real estate development and corporate support service functions. 
Real Estate Operations represents the performance of the Company’s core rental real estate portfolio and is comprised of the following reportable operating segments:

• | Office - owns, acquires and operates office and life science buildings.


• | Apartments - owns, acquires and operates upscale and middle-market apartments and adaptive re-use developments.


• | Retail - owns, acquires and operates amenity retail within our mixed-use properties, and remaining regional malls and specialty/urban retail centers.

The remaining reportable operating segments consist of the following:

• | Development - develops and constructs office and life science buildings, apartments, condominiums, amenity retail and mixed-use projects. The Development segment includes recently opened operating properties prior to stabilization and the horizontal development and sale of land to residential, commercial and industrial customers primarily at its Stapleton project in Denver, Colorado.


• | Corporate - provides executive oversight and various support services for Operations, Development and Corporate employees. 


• | Other - owned and operated non-core investments, including the Barclays Center, a sports and entertainment arena located in Brooklyn, New York (“Arena”) (sold in January 2016), the Company’s equity method investment in the Brooklyn Nets (the “Nets”) (sold in January 2016), and military housing operations (sold in February 2016).

Financial information about reportable operating segments required by this item is included in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Note AA – Segment Information.
Segment Transfers
The Development segment includes projects in development, projects under construction along with recently opened operating properties prior to stabilization. Projects will be reported in their applicable operating segment (Office, Apartments or Retail) beginning on January 1 of the year following stabilization. Therefore, the Development segment will continue to report results from recently opened properties until the year-end following initial stabilization. The Company generally defines stabilized properties as achieving 92% or greater occupancy or having been open and operating for one or two years, depending on the size of the project. Once a stabilized property is transferred to the applicable Operations segment on January 1, it will be considered “comparable” beginning with the next January 1, as that will be the first time the property is stabilized in both periods presented.
REIT Conversion
On January 13, 2015, the board of directors of Forest City Enterprises, Inc., the Company’s predecessor, approved a plan to pursue conversion to real estate investment trust (“REIT”) status. On May 29, 2015, Forest City Enterprises, Inc. formed the Company as a Maryland corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. On October 20, 2015, the stockholders of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. approved and adopted the merger agreement that implemented the restructuring of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. into a holding company so as to facilitate its conversion to a REIT.
2

Pursuant to the merger agreement, effective as of 11:59 pm, Eastern Time, on December 31, 2015 (the “Effective Time”), (i) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company merged with and into Forest City Enterprises, Inc., with Forest City Enterprises, Inc. as the surviving corporation, (ii) each outstanding share of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. Class A common stock, par value $.33 1/3 per share, and Class B common stock, par value $.33 1/3 per share, automatically converted into one share of Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. Class A common stock, $.01 par value per share, and Class B common stock, $.01 par value per share, respectively, (iii) Forest City Enterprises, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and (iv) the Company became the publicly-traded New York Stock Exchange-listed parent company that succeeded to and continued to operate substantially all of the existing businesses of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries. In addition, each share of Class A common stock of Forest City Enterprises, Inc. held in treasury at December 31, 2015 ceased to be outstanding at the Effective Time of the Merger, and a corresponding adjustment was recorded to Class A common stock and additional paid-in capital. Immediately following the merger, Forest City Enterprises, Inc. converted into a Delaware limited partnership named “Forest City Enterprises, L.P.” (the “Operating Partnership”).
In this annual report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise specifically stated or the context otherwise requires, all references to “the Company,” “Forest City,” “we,” “our,” “us” and similar terms refer to Forest City Enterprises, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and Forest City Realty Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, as of the Effective Time and thereafter.
Company Operations
The Company is organized as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes. The Company holds substantially all of its assets, and conducts substantially all of its business, through the Operating Partnership. The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of December 31, 2017, owns all of the limited partnership interests directly or indirectly in the Operating Partnership.
The Company holds and operates certain of its assets through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT subject to applicable corporate income tax. The Company’s use of TRSs enables it to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements and allows the Company to retain income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement of distributing those earnings. The primary businesses held in TRSs include 461 Dean Street, an apartment building in Brooklyn, New York, South Bay Galleria (sold in December 2017), Antelope Valley Mall (sold in January 2018), Mall at Robinson (sold in February 2018) and Charleston Town Center, regional malls in Redondo Beach, California, Palmdale, California, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Charleston, West Virginia, respectively, Pacific Park Brooklyn project, land development operations, Barclays Center arena (sold in January 2016), the Nets (sold in January 2016), and military housing operations (sold in February 2016). In the future, the Company may elect to reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from its TRSs to other subsidiaries, including qualified REIT subsidiaries.

(1) | Square feet of expiring leases and average contractual rent per square foot are operating statistics representing 100% of the square footage and contractual rental income per square foot from expiring leases.


(2) | Contractual rent expiring is an operating statistic and is not comparable to rental revenue, a GAAP financial measure. The primary differences arise because contractual rent is calculated at the Company’s ownership share and excludes adjustments for the impacts of straight-line rent, amortization of intangible assets related to in-place leases, above and below market leases and overage rental payments (which are not reasonably estimable). Contractual rent per square foot includes base rent, fixed additional charges for marketing/promotional charges, common area maintenance and real estate taxes.

Apartments
The Apartments segment owns, acquires, and operates upscale and middle-market apartments and adaptive re-use developments. The Company has been engaged in apartment community development for over 60 years and continues to concentrate future apartment community development largely in its core markets.
A summary of apartment operating properties as of December 31, 2017 at 100% is as follows:

Operating Properties | Property Count | Number of Units
Core Market Apartment Communities | | 
Greater New York City | 4 | 1,891

Retail
A summary of retail operating properties as of December 31, 2017 at 100% is as follows:

Operating Properties | Property Count | Gross Leasable Area (in square feet)
QIC | 8 | 5,181,000 
Madison | 12 | 2,128,000 
Other Retail | 9 | 2,263,000 
Total | 29 | 9,572,000 

The Retail segment owns, acquires and operates amenity retail within our mixed-use properties, and remaining regional malls and specialty/urban retail centers in both urban and suburban locations. Amenity retail includes retail and entertainment based tenants typically located within or adjacent to our mixed-use projects. 
Following the August 2016 announcement to review strategic alternatives for a portion of its retail portfolio, the Company has begun to focus primarily on smaller amenity retail development in conjunction with the development of mixed-use projects whose primary focus is apartments or office rental properties. 
In our remaining regional malls, the anchor stores typically own their facilities as an integral part of the mall structure and do not typically generate significant rental revenue to the Company. In contrast, anchor stores at specialty retail centers generally are tenants under long-term leases that typically provide significant rental revenue to the Company.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company signed definitive agreements with two of our existing partners for the disposition of 10 of our regional mall assets and 12 of our specialty retail assets.
As of December 31, 2017, we have closed on the sale of two of the regional mall assets to Queensland Investment Corporation (“QIC”). Through February 2018, we closed on the sale of two additional regional mall assets to QIC. We expect two additional regional mall assets to close in the first half of 2018 pending lender and other third party approvals. The remaining four regional mall assets are expected to close as we secure replacement assets.
In December 2017, we closed on a transaction with Madison International (“Madison”) where we converted primarily all of our common ownership interests in 10 of 12 specialty retail assets to preferred ownership interests. Closings on the conversion of our common ownership interests to preferred ownership interests in the two other specialty retail assets are expected to occur in the first half of 2018. We expect these preferred ownership interests to result in tax-deferred transactions and be redeployed into office and apartment assets that align with our focus on primarily core markets and urban mixed-use placemaking projects, including amenity retail.

Based on the executed transaction agreements, the total initial economics of the combined retail transactions prior to any disposals discussed above reflect an average cap rate of approximately five percent on 2016 net operating income of approximately $105,000,000 and total debt of approximately $920,000,000. The QIC regional mall definitive agreement includes seller financing of up to $150,000,000, which matures in 2019. The NOI and total debt discussed above excludes the 42nd Street specialty retail asset, which is expected to close after resolution of a ground rent dispute with the City of New York. However, there can be no assurance that the remaining transactions could be consummated on the terms described above or at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that the remaining transactions, if consummated, could be executed in a tax deferred manner.
See the “Operations-Office and Retail” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 for additional operating statistics.
Development 
In its office development activities, the Company is primarily a build-to-suit developer that works with tenants to meet their requirements. The Company’s office development has focused primarily on mixed-use projects in urban developments, often built in conjunction with apartments and amenity retail or as part of a major office or life science campus. As a result of this focus on urban developments, the Company continues to concentrate future `office and mixed-use developments largely in its core markets.
A summary of development properties at 100% is as follows:

December 31, 2017 | Number of Properties | Number of Units | Gross Leasable Area (in square feet)
Properties Under Construction/Redevelopment: | | | 
Apartments | 5 | | 1,421 | 63,250 
Retail | 1 | | — | 307,000 
Operating Properties Prior to Stabilization: | | | 
Apartments | 12 | | 4,084 | 75,000 
Office | 2 | | — | 399,000 
Retail | 2 | | — | 326,000 
Total | 22 | | 5,505 | 1,170,250

Our Stapleton project is one of the nation’s largest urban redevelopments with additional future entitlements, including apartments, retail and office space as well as single family neighborhoods, where the Company sells residential lots to homebuilders. The Company controls the future development opportunity at Stapleton through an option agreement. As of December 31, 2017, the Company owns 449 acres of undeveloped land (including 212 saleable acres) and a purchase option for 312 acres at Stapleton which expires in May 2019.
Through December 31, 2017, the Company has purchased 2,623 acres at Stapleton. In addition to the developable land available through purchase options, there are 1,116 acres reserved for regional parks and open space, of which 1,100 acres are currently under construction or have been completed. At December 31, 2017, Stapleton also has approximately 2.6 million square feet of retail space, approximately 400,000 square feet of office space, approximately 3.3 million square feet of other commercial space and 1,748 apartment units completed, with another 515 apartment units under construction. 
Other
The Other segment represents the prior operations of several non-core investments, including the Barclays Center, a sports and entertainment arena located in Brooklyn, New York (“Arena”) (sold in January 2016), the Company’s equity method investment in the Brooklyn Nets (the “Nets”) (sold in January 2016), and military housing operations (sold in February 2016).

Competition
The real estate industry is highly competitive in many markets in which the Company operates. There are numerous other developers, managers and owners of office, apartment and retail real estate and undeveloped land competing with the Company nationally, regionally and/or locally, some of whom may have greater financial resources and market share than the Company. They compete with the Company for management and leasing opportunities, land for development, properties for acquisition and disposition, and for anchor stores and tenants for properties. The Company may not be able to successfully compete in these areas. In addition, competition could over-saturate markets and as a result, the Company may not have sufficient cash to meet the nonrecourse debt service requirements on certain of its properties. Although the Company may attempt to negotiate a restructuring or extension of the nonrecourse mortgage, the Company may not be successful, which could cause a property to be transferred to the mortgagee.
The Company’s apartment portfolio not only competes against other apartment buildings in the area, but other housing options, such as condominiums and single home ownership. If trends shift more to home ownership instead of rental, the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and realizable value of assets upon disposition could be materially and adversely affected.
Tenants at the Company’s amenity retail properties and remaining regional malls and specialty retail centers face continual competition in attracting customers from retailers at other shopping centers, catalogue companies, online merchants, warehouse stores, large discounters, outlet malls, wholesale clubs, direct mail and telemarketers. The Company’s competitors and those of its tenants could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to lease space in its properties and on the rents it can charge or the concessions it may have to grant. These factors could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, and realizable value of its assets upon sale.
Number of Employees
The Company had 1,473 full-time and 75 part-time employees as of December 31, 2017.
