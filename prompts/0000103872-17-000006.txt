ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Volt Information Sciences, Inc. (the “Company” or “Volt”) is a global provider of staffing services (traditional time and materials-based as well as project-based) and information technology infrastructure services. Our staffing services consist of workforce solutions that include providing contingent workers, personnel recruitment services, and managed staffing services programs supporting primarily light industrial, professional administration, technical, information technology and engineering positions. Our technology outsourcing services provide pre- and post- production development support, testing, and customer support to companies in the mobile, gaming, and technology devices industries. Our managed service programs consist of managing the procurement and on-boarding of contingent workers from multiple providers. Our information technology infrastructure services provide server, storage, network and desktop IT hardware maintenance, data center and network monitoring and operations. Our complementary businesses offer customized talent, technology and consulting solutions to a diverse client base. Volt services global industries including aerospace, automotive, banking and finance, consumer electronics, information technology, insurance, life sciences, manufacturing, media and entertainment, pharmaceutical, software, telecommunications, transportation, and utilities. The Company was incorporated in New York in 1957. Unless the context otherwise requires, throughout this report, the words “Volt,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Volt Information Sciences, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Geographic Regions and Segments:
Volt operates in approximately 100 locations worldwide, with approximately 86% of our revenues generated in the United States where we have employees in all 50 states. Our principal non-U.S. markets include Canada, Europe and several Asia Pacific locations. Our global footprint enables us to deliver consistent quality to our large strategic customers that require an established international presence. 
During fiscal 2016, we evaluated our reportable segment structure based on our new management organization and the changes implemented in connection with our new business strategies, including the initiatives to exit non-strategic and non-core operations. 
As a result of this assessment, we now report our activities in three reportable segments and an “Other” category:

• | North American Staffing


• | International Staffing


• | Technology Outsourcing Services and Solutions; and


• | Corporate and Other

All other business activities that do not meet the criteria to be reportable segments are aggregated with corporate services in the Corporate and Other category. Our new reportable segments have been determined in accordance with our internal management structure, which is based on operating activities. We evaluate business performance based upon several metrics, primarily using profitable revenue growth and segment operating income as the primary financial measures. We believe operating income provides management and investors a measure to analyze operating performance of each business segment against historical and competitors’ data, although historical results, including operating income, may not be indicative of future results as operating income is highly contingent on many factors including the state of the economy, competitive conditions and customer preferences. There has been no change in our total consolidated financial condition or results of operations previously reported as a result of the change in our reportable segments. 
We allocate all support related costs to the operating segments except for costs not directly relating to our operating activities such as corporate-wide general and administrative costs and fees related to restatement, investigations and remediation that were completed during fiscal 2014. These costs are not allocated to individual operating segments because doing so would not enhance the understanding of segment operating performance and such costs are not used by management to measure segment performance.
We report our segment information in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, “Segment Reporting,” (“FASB ASC Topic 280”). See Note 20, “Segment Disclosures” for further information.

Description of the Reportable Segments and Corporate and Other Category
North American and International Staffing Segments
Our two staffing services segments provide workforce management expertise through locations in North America, Europe and several Asia Pacific locations. We deliver a broad spectrum of contingent staffing, direct placement, recruitment process outsourcing (RPO), staffing management, and other employment services. Our contingent workers are placed on assignment with our customers in a broad range of occupations including manufacturing, assembly, warehousing, industrial, information technology, engineering, administrative, call center, accounting and finance. 
Our contingent staffing services are provided for varying periods of time to companies and other organizations (including government agencies) ranging from smaller retail accounts that may require ten or fewer contingent workers at a time to large strategic accounts that require as many as several thousand contingent workers at a time. Our large strategic accounts typically enter into longer term procurement agreements with us resulting in lower direct margins compared to our retail accounts.
Within our staffing services segments, we refer to customers that require multi-location, coordinated account management and service delivery in multiple skill sets as strategic or national customers, while our retail customers are primarily in a single location with sales and delivery handled primarily from a geographically local team and with relatively few headcount on assignment in one or two skill sets. We provide traditional staffing services for which we are paid on a time and materials basis and provide contingent staff that work under the supervision of our customers. 
Volt’s contingent staffing services enable customers to easily scale their workforce to meet changing business conditions, complete a specific project, secure the services of a specialist on an as-needed basis, substitute for regular employees during vacation or other temporary absences, staff high turnover positions, or meet seasonal peaks in workforce needs. When requested, we also provide Volt personnel at the customer’s location to coordinate and manage contingent workers. Many customers rely on Volt’s staffing services as a strategic element of their overall workforce, allowing them to more efficiently meet their fluctuating staffing requirements.
Contingent workers are recruited through proprietary internet recruiting sites, independent web-based job search companies, and social networking talent communities through which we build and maintain proprietary databases of candidates from which we can fill current and future customer needs. Contingent workers become Volt employees during the period of their assignment and we are responsible for the payment of wages, payroll taxes, workers’ compensation insurance, unemployment insurance and other benefits. Customers will sometimes hire Volt’s contingent workers as their own employees after a period of time, for which we usually receive a fee.
We also provide recruitment and direct placement services of specialists in the accounting, finance, administrative, call center, engineering, information technology, manufacturing, assembly and industrial support disciplines. These services are primarily provided on a contingency basis with fees earned only if our customers ultimately hire the candidates.
Technology Outsourcing Services and Solutions Segment
Our Technology Outsourcing Services and Solutions segment provides quality assurance, business intelligence and analytics and customer service support for companies in a variety of industries. Our global, integrated pre- and post-production services and call center solutions deliver end-to-end value for a range of consumer-facing technology companies, whose products include hardware, software, games, mobile products, and wearable devices.
We partner with companies of all sizes to get better products to market faster and deliver exceptional support for every stage of the product lifecycle. Our scalable services are customized to the way our clients work and provide the flexibility and expertise to improve operational agility, efficiency, and productivity.

• | Quality Assurance - Our services assist in ensuring our customers’ product performs as designed. These services extend to game, hardware, software, consumer product and mobile product and service offerings. 


• | Business Intelligence and Analytics - We assist our customers in making informed business decisions through implementing quality assurance methodologies, which when combined with visibility of our customers’ data allows us to reduce inefficiencies and optimize our customers’ business.


• | Customer Care - We specialize in serving as an extension and collaborating with our customers, from help desk inquiries to advanced technical support, while maintaining the consumer relationships our customers have developed.


• | Software Development - We assist our customers in architecture assessments, solution design, and development of their custom web, mobile applications and enterprise solutions.

Corporate and Other Category
Our Corporate and Other category consists of our North American managed service programs (“MSP”) business, information technology infrastructure services business, corporate services, telecommunication infrastructure and security services business, remote hire services business in India, staffing business in Uruguay as well as our Uruguayan telephone directory publishing and printing business. We sold our telephone directory publishing and printing business during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and we sold substantially all of the assets of our telecommunication infrastructure and security services business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold our staffing business in Uruguay.
Our MSP business consists of managing the procurement and on-boarding of contingent workers and a broad range of specialized solutions that includes managing suppliers and providing sourcing and recruiting support, statement of work management, supplier performance measurement, optimization and analysis, benchmarking of spend demographics and market rate analysis, consolidated customer billing, and supplier payment management. The workforce placed on assignment through our MSPs is usually provided by third-party staffing providers (“associate vendors”) or through our own staffing services. In most cases, we are only required to pay associate vendors after we receive payment from our customer. We also act as a subcontractor or associate vendor to other national providers in their MSPs. Our MSPs are typically administered through the use of vendor management system software (“VMS”) licensed from various VMS providers.
In addition, we offer and provide payroll service solutions for our customers. With our payroll service solution (also known as referred services), the customer refers an individual to us, we employ the individual, and the individual works on an assignment for the customer at the customer’s worksite. We manage and administer the individual’s payroll, payroll taxes, workers’ compensation, and benefits. 
Our information technology infrastructure business provides IT hardware maintenance services on major brands of server, storage, network and desktop products to Fortune 1000 companies.  Other services provided include remote monitoring for corporate data centers and networks, and planning, migration and support services for clients seeking to migrate to a cloud environment. We deliver our services across the United States and in major business centers globally and sell these services directly to corporate customers and through value-added resellers, partners and other resellers. Our target markets include financial services, telecommunications and aerospace. This business has been classified as held for sale.
Our corporate services provide entity-wide general and administrative functions that support all of our segments.
Our remote hire services in India provides skilled manpower resources, infrastructure, and management for various practice areas including software development, engineering, web design, technical support, call center operations, sales and marketing, customer service, research, and back-office accounting and administration. 
Our telecommunication infrastructure and security services business was an integrator of enterprise, location and metropolitan security, voice and data systems for Fortune 500 companies, critical infrastructure and telecommunications companies and government entities across the United States. We sold substantially all of the assets of this business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
Our telephone directory publishing and printing business published directories in Uruguay including telephone directories, directories for publishers in other countries, and commercial books, magazines, periodicals and advertising material. This business was sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
Business Strategy
Fiscal 2016 was a year where we continued to advance our strategic plan aimed to get our business to return to profitable growth. As we implement our strategic plan, we continue to focus on three key elements: enhancing our balance sheet, improving our cost structure and margins, and achieving top-line growth. 
Enhancing our Balance Sheet
The first key element of our strategic plan is to enhance our balance sheet. 
During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we sold our staffing business in Uruguay, our Computer Systems segment, the telephone directory publishing and printing business in Uruguay, and we exited our telecommunication infrastructure and security services government solutions business. Each of these businesses had significantly different risk and return profiles than our core staffing services. Although these transactions netted nominal proceeds, the operations of these businesses were either break-even or generating operating losses. These divestitures also enabled the Company’s management to focus resources on opportunities within our core staffing services where we believe we are better positioned to add value to the Company. Also as part of this strategic plan, we intend to sell our information technology infrastructure business (“Maintech”). 
6

During this past year, we have strengthened Volt’s balance sheet and over the past several years we have improved our liquidity position, in large part through the divestiture of several non-core legacy assets, the successful monetization of non-strategic company-owned real estate and the reduction and refinancing of outstanding debt. In January 2017, we amended and extended our Financing Program, which maintained the capacity at $160.0 million, while extending the term through January of 2018.
Improving our Cost Structure and Margins
The second key element of our strategic plan is to improve our cost structure and margins. We remain committed to delivering superior client service at a reasonable cost. We believe that building upon our established brands and reinforcing our strong customer relationships will position Volt to grow profitability and increase shareholder value. We are focused on increasing profitability through initiatives to increase revenues and improve margins, reduce operating expenses, provide superior delivery and expand profitable service offerings. We are pursuing these initiatives along with promoting a culture of disciplined execution to further expand our operating income. Key elements of our business strategy include:

• | increase our market share in our key customers and target market sectors;


• | provide superior delivery that will ultimately drive higher revenues at improved margins;


• | focus on core business offerings and on market sectors where we are profitable or that have long-term growth potential, and reduce or eliminate non-core, non-strategic business;


• | increase the percentage of our revenue represented by higher-margin business;


• | exit or reduce business levels in sectors or with customers where profitability or business terms are unfavorable;


• | consolidate financial and other administrative and support functions, implement process standardization, and use productivity metrics to drive more cost-effective performance; and


• | invest in new and efficient systems, sales and marketing infrastructure.

Our goal is to reduce complexity and identify and remove manual and redundant processes, while simplifying the organization, all with a focus on aligning our support infrastructure with the requirements of the business. We believe that the results of the above actions will ultimately drive higher revenues at improved margins. 
We will continue to evaluate our individual businesses and service offerings as we seek to manage the balance between profitability and top-line growth. These assessments are being conducted in the context of our broader portfolio and our targeted risk and return profile. Businesses or service offerings that do not meet our investment parameters will be discontinued or divested. We believe that these actions will continue to improve our results as well as the consistency of our returns across our portfolio of businesses.
As part of our overall initiative to improve our cost structure and margins which we believe will ultimately drive efficiencies and profitability, we further reduced our headcount within both corporate services and our business units. Due to these actions and the implementation of other initiatives focused on creating efficiencies, we have significantly improved our cost structure during fiscal 2016. The improved cost structure and savings we have achieved have been partially offset in our results by the important investment in key new hires we made during the year to fortify our team. We have overcome significant cost headwinds and added numerous strong, talented people to our executive leadership, sales & marketing and IT teams.
We also believe our business with both existing and new clients has been impacted by out-of-date infrastructure and systems. In an effort to reduce our operating costs, increase our speed to market and increase operating efficiencies, we are nearing the deployment of a new information technology system which encompasses our front and back office financial suite and IT tools that are critical to our success and offer more functionality at a lower cost to the Company. This upgrade will mitigate potential operating risks from outdated software, reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies and it will support our front-end recruitment and placement capabilities as well as increase efficiencies in our back-office financial suite. Ultimately, these upgrades should improve our time to market and competitiveness in sales delivery, which will support and enhance our future growth. 
Achieving Top-Line Growth
The third key element of our strategic plan is to achieve top-line growth. We believe that the actions we took in fiscal 2016 and will take in fiscal 2017 will ultimately drive higher revenues. In fiscal 2017, we intend to improve top-line growth by expanding our business with existing customers and winning new profitable business. 
During fiscal 2016, we made progress in bending the revenue curve to drive top-line growth. Our continued strengths are our strong brand, our established capabilities in sourcing a high quality contingent workforce, our longstanding relationships with our customers, and our talented team. Our focus continues to be increasing our revenue in more profitable verticals and expanding our share of customer engagements, as well as ongoing improvements in the delivery of our staffing services. 
7

We also placed emphasis and will continue to emphasize on building end-to-end customer relationships by further enhancing our understanding of their needs and striving to anticipate and deliver the highest level of value-added service to our customers. 
We are focused on developing a team that has both strong and deep experience and the leadership skills that are required to drive future growth of the business, which will be achieved by developing new workforce capabilities and a committed, diverse executive team.
We expect to see benefits from our newly restructured and realigned sales and client facing organization. This includes the fortification of our sales team during the second half of fiscal 2016 with the addition of a significant amount of new talent at all levels. We have also completed the redesign of all our domestic compensation plans and compensation structure within our sales organization to reduce complexities and incentivize profitable growth. In regards to our compensation structure, compared to prior years, significantly more employees now have more of their compensation at risk and tied specifically to our revenue and operating income budget objectives. While this required a significant effort on behalf of our management and leadership teams, we feel these actions were necessary in driving a pay-for-performance culture at Volt and aligning our incentive structure with company-wide strategy and metrics. 
We believe the above factors will drive our top line growth and result in increased profitability. 
Capital Allocation 
In addition to our planned improvements in technology, we have prioritized our capital allocation strategy to strengthen our balance sheet and increase our competitiveness in the marketplace. The timing of these initiatives is highly dependent upon attaining the profitability objectives outlined in our plan and the cash flow resulting from the completion of our liquidity initiatives. We also see this as an opportunity to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to Volt shareholders as we continue to execute on our plan and return to sustainable profitability. Our capital allocation strategy includes the following elements:

• | Maintaining appropriate levels of working capital. Our business requires a certain level of cash resources to efficiently execute operations. Consistent with similar companies in our industry and operational capabilities, we estimate this amount to be 1.5 to 2.0 times our weekly cash distributions on a global basis and must accommodate seasonality and cyclical trends;


• | Reinvesting in our business. We continue to execute on our company-wide initiative of disciplined reinvestment in our business including new information technology systems which will support our front-end recruitment and placement capabilities as well as increase efficiencies in our back-office financial suite. We are also investing in our sales and recruiting process and resources, which is critical to drive profitable revenue growth;


• | Deleveraging our balance sheet. By lowering our debt level, we will strengthen our balance sheet, reduce interest costs and reduce risk going forward;


• | Returning capital to shareholders. Part of our strategy is to return capital to our shareholders when circumstances permit in connection with share buybacks through our existing share buyback program; and


• | Acquiring value-added businesses. Potentially in the longer-term, identifying, and when circumstances permit, acquiring companies which would be accretive to our operating income and that could leverage Volt's scale, infrastructure and capabilities. Strategic acquisitions could potentially strengthen Volt in certain industry verticals or in specific geographic locations.

Customers
The Company serves multinational, national and local customers, providing staffing services (traditional time and materials-based as well as project-based), managed service programs, technology outsourcing services, information technology infrastructure services (and telecommunication infrastructure and operations services and telephone directory publishing and printing in Uruguay through the latter part of fiscal 2015). The Company had no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. Our top 10 customers represented approximately 27%, 30% and 30% of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 revenue, respectively. The loss of one or more of these customers, unless the business is replaced, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.
In fiscal 2016, the International Staffing segment's revenue included one customer which accounted for approximately 11% of the total revenue of that segment and the Technology Outsourcing Services and Solutions segment's revenue included two customers which accounted for approximately 28% and 24%, respectively, of the total revenue of that segment.

In fiscal 2015, the Technology Outsourcing Services and Solutions segment's revenue included two customers which accounted for approximately 34% and 29%, respectively, of the total revenue of that segment.
In fiscal 2014, the Technology Outsourcing Services and Solutions segment's revenue included two customers which accounted for approximately 46% and 24%, respectively, of the total revenue of that segment.
For fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, 86%, 85% and 87% of our revenue, respectively, were from customers in the United States. 
Competition
The markets in which Volt provides staffing services are highly competitive. As there are few significant barriers to entry, new entrants frequently appear, resulting in considerable market fragmentation. There are over 100 competitors in our industry with annual revenues over $300 million, some of whom are larger than us and have greater resources than we do. These large competitors collectively represent less than half of all staffing services revenues, and there are many smaller companies competing in varying degrees at local levels. Our direct staffing competitors include Adecco, Allegis, CDI Corp., Hudson Global, Inc., Insperity, Inc., Kelly Services, Inc., Manpower Group, Randstad, Recruit, Robert Half, Inc., Tempstaff and TrueBlue, Inc.
In addition, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate. Companies in our industries primarily compete on price, service quality, new capabilities and technologies, marketing methods and speed of fulfilling assignments.
Our IT infrastructure business competes with large system integration firms as well as software and hardware providers that are increasingly offering services to support their products. Many of our competitors are able to offer a wide range of global services and some of our competitors benefit from greater brand recognition than we have.
Intellectual Property
VOLT is the principal registered trademark for our brand in the United States. ARCTERN, A VOLT INFORMATION SCIENCES COMPANY, MAINTECH, PARTNER WITH US. COMPETE WITH ANYBODY, TEAM WITH US. COMPETE WITH ANYBODY., REMOTEHIRE and VOLTSOURCE are other registered trademarks in the United States. The Company also owns and uses common law trademarks and service marks.
We also own copyrights and license technology from many providers. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad to protect our brand and proprietary information.
Seasonality
Our staffing services revenue and operating income are typically lowest in our first fiscal quarter due to the holiday season and are affected by customer facility closures during the holidays (in some cases for up to two weeks), and closures caused by severe weather conditions. The demand for our staffing services typically increases during our third and fourth fiscal quarters when customers increase the use of our administrative and industrial labor during the summer vacation period. The first couple of months of the calendar year typically have the lowest margins as employer payroll tax contributions restart each year in January. Margins typically increase in subsequent fiscal quarters as annual payroll tax contribution maximums are met, particularly for higher salaried employees.
Employees
As of October 30, 2016, Volt employed approximately 25,800 people, including approximately 23,400 who were on contingent staffing assignments. The workers on contingent staffing assignments are on our payroll for the length of their assignment.
We are focused on developing a team that has both strong and deep experience and the leadership skills that are required to support our growth. Our strategy is to be a leader in the markets we serve, which we will achieve by developing new workforce capabilities and a committed, diverse world-class management team.
We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. While claims and legal actions related to staffing matters arise on a routine basis, we believe they are inherent in maintaining a large contingent workforce.
9

Regulation
Some states in the United States and certain foreign countries license and regulate contingent staffing service firms and employment agencies. Compliance with applicable present federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations has not had, and we believe that compliance with those laws and regulations in the future will not have, a material effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
