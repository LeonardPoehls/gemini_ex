ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a medical technology company that uses our proprietary iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform to develop, manufacture and sell joint replacement implants that are individually sized and shaped, which we refer to as customized, to fit each patient's unique anatomy. The worldwide market for joint replacement products is approximately $17.5 billion annually and growing, and we believe our iFit technology platform is applicable to all major joints in this market. We offer a broad line of customized knee implants designed to restore the natural shape of a patient's knee. We have sold a total of more than 50,000 knee implants in the United States and Europe. In clinical studies, iTotal CR, our cruciate-retaining total knee replacement implant and best-selling product, demonstrated superior clinical outcomes, including better function and greater patient satisfaction compared to off-the-shelf implants. In March 2016, we initiated the broad commercial launch of the iTotal PS, our posterior-stabilized total knee replacement implant which addresses the largest segment of the knee replacement market. 
Our iFit technology platform comprises three key elements:

• | iFit Design, our proprietary algorithms and computer software that we use to design customized implants and associated single-use, patient-specific instrumentation, which we refer to as iJigs, based on a computed tomography, or CT, scan of the patient and to prepare a surgical plan customized for the patient that we call iView.


• | iFit Printing, a three-dimensional, or 3D, printing technology that we use to manufacture iJigs and that we may extend to manufacture certain components of our customized knee replacement implants.


• | iFit Just-in-Time Delivery, our just-in-time manufacturing and delivery capabilities.

We believe our iFit technology platform enables a scalable business model that greatly lowers our inventory requirements, reduces the amount of working capital required to support our operations and allows us to launch new products and product improvements more rapidly, as compared to manufacturers of off-the-shelf implants. Manufacturers of traditional knee replacement implants offer products with a limited range of sizes and geometries, which we refer to as off-the-shelf implants. Off-the-shelf implants are not designed to restore a particular patient's unique anatomy. 
Based on clinical data developed independently by orthopedic surgeons comparing our iTotal CR to off-the-shelf total knee replacement implants, as well as our own research and the common approach we employ in the design and manufacture of our products, we believe that our customized knee replacement implants offer significant benefits to patients, surgeons and hospitals that are not afforded by off-the-shelf implants.

• | For the patient. We believe that our individualized approach offers better clinical outcomes when compared to off-the-shelf implants based on the following measures: 


▪ | Better fit. We design our customized knee implants to restore the patient's own native anatomy. As a result, we believe that our implants fit better. 


• | Faster recovery. We believe an individual fit requires less bone and soft tissue removal by the surgeon, thereby shortening recovery times. 


• | Better function. We design our customized knee implants to follow the particular shape and contour of the patient's knee. As a result, we believe our implants offer an increased potential for a knee that moves more naturally and is more stable. 


▪ | Greater patient satisfaction. We believe our implants offer patients greater overall satisfaction with the results of their knee replacement. 


• | For the surgeon. We believe that the combination of the use of our iJigs with our customized knee replacement implants enables a more accurate, reproducible and simplified surgical procedure by reducing the number of required steps and increasing the precision of the placement of the implant. A study of 63 knee replacement surgeries, published in 2017 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Knee Surgery, indicates that 84% of patients achieved perfect neutral coronal mechanical alignment after surgery, and that 100% of patients were within the desired alignment range after surgery. Similarly, a prior retrospective study of 200 knee replacement surgeries published in 2014 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Arthroplasty, or the 2014 JOA Study, indicated that our iTotal CR implant was 1.8 times more likely to be in the desired alignment range after surgery than an off-the-shelf implant. At the time the 2014 JOA Study was conducted, one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us.

• | For the hospital. We believe that our customized knee replacement implants and iFit technology platform provide a better economic outcome for hospitals by: 


• | improving patient recovery times, reducing blood loss and reducing adverse event rates;


• | reducing the costs associated with managing and sterilizing large numbers of reusable instruments;


• | improving turnaround times with the potential for more procedures to be completed within the same amount of time and for the hospital to generate additional revenue.

As of February 28, 2018, we own or exclusively in-license a total of approximately 420 issued patents and pending patent applications that cover customized implants and patient-specific instrumentation, or PSI, for all major joints and other elements of our iFit technology platform. Our intellectual property portfolio includes 148 issued United States patents, 67 patents issued in countries outside the United States, and 205 patent applications worldwide. See Note J - "Legal Proceedings" in the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our patent litigation.
All of our knee replacement products have been cleared by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the premarket notification process of Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and have received certification to CE Mark. We market our products to orthopedic surgeons, hospitals, and other medical facilities, and patients. We use direct sales representatives, independent sales representatives and distributors to market and sell our products in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and other markets.
Industry background
Market opportunity
Joint replacement for treatment of osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis is the principal condition that leads to joint replacement surgery. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of the cartilage that protects and cushions key joints in the body, including the knees, hips and shoulders. This causes the bones in the affected joint to rub against each other, which can result in significant and chronic joint pain, stiffness, swelling, numbness, loss of flexibility and loss of motor function. The pain of osteoarthritis, even during the early stages of the disease, can be overwhelming for patients and can have significant physical, psychological, quality of life and financial implications.
An estimated 27 million people in the United States and 630 million people worldwide suffer from osteoarthritis. Compelling demographic trends, such as the growing population of aging yet active individuals and rising rates of obesity, are expected to be key drivers in the continued growth of osteoarthritis occurrence. The National Institutes of Health, or NIH, projects that by 2030, approximately 70 million people in the United States will be 65 years or older and will be at high risk of developing osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is more common in adults over the age of 50, but the condition and precursors of the condition can be observed much earlier. For moderate to advanced cases of osteoarthritis, a surgical procedure may be required to replace the damaged joint. During this joint replacement, or arthroplasty, procedure, a surgeon removes the damaged bone in the affected joint and inserts an implant as a replacement. The joint implant may replace all of the principal components of the joint, in which case the procedure is referred to as a total joint replacement, or may replace only a portion of the joint, in which case the procedure is referred to as a partial joint replacement. 
Joint replacement market
According to the Orthopaedic Industry Annual Report for the 2016 calendar year, which was published in May 2017 by Orthoworld Inc., or the 2016 Orthoworld Report, worldwide sales of joint replacement products, including replacements for knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, ankles and digits outside of trauma, exceeded $17.5 billion in 2016 and are expected to grow to approximately $21 billion by the end of 2021. The 2016 Orthoworld Report estimated that worldwide sales of knee replacement products totaled approximately $8.5 billion and the United States represented approximately 49% of total estimated worldwide sales of such products. In 2016, according to the 2016 Orthoworld Report, worldwide sales of hip replacement products totaled approximately $6.9 billion. According to the 2016 Orthoworld Report, 2016 estimated sales of hip replacement products in the United States represented approximately 40% of total estimated worldwide sales of such products. According to the 2013 iData Report, primary total hip replacement implants accounted for approximately 69% by revenue of the 2013 hip replacement market in the United States. The market for joint replacements extends beyond knee and hip replacements. For example, the treatment of osteoarthritis in the extremities, including the shoulder, elbow, wrist and digit, may involve the replacement of the affected joint. According to the 2016 Orthoworld Report, the worldwide extremities joint replacement market was estimated at $1.9 billion in 2016.

The ConforMIS Solution: One Patient, One Implant
No two joints are the same; accordingly, we believe no two implants should be the same. We believe our customized joint replacement products and proprietary technology create an opportunity to disrupt the large, existing market for off-the-shelf orthopedic implants. We use our proprietary iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform to design and manufacture customized knee implants that are precisely sized and shaped to fit the unique three-dimensional curvatures of each patient's knee, as well as associated customized, single-use patient-specific instrumentation, which we refer to as iJigs. We believe our proprietary iFit technology platform is applicable to all major joints.
iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform
Our iFit technology platform comprises three key elements:

• | iFit Design, our proprietary algorithms and computer software that we use to design customized implants and associated iJigs based on a CT scan of the patient and to prepare a surgical plan customized for the patient that we call iView.


• | iFit Printing, a 3D printing technology that we use to manufacture iJigs and may extend to manufacture certain components of our customized knee replacement implants.


• | iFit Just-in-Time Delivery, our just-in-time manufacturing and delivery capabilities. We manufacture the customized replacement joint and iJigs to order and do not maintain significant inventory of finished products. We deliver the customized knee replacement implant and iJigs to the hospital in advance of the scheduled arthroplasty procedure.

We believe our iFit technology platform enables a scalable business model that greatly lowers our inventory requirements, reduces the amount of working capital required to support our operations and allows us to launch new products and product improvements more rapidly, as compared to manufacturers of off-the-shelf implants
Key benefits of our customized products
We use our iFit technology platform to develop customized joint replacement systems and single-use surgical instruments. Based on clinical data developed independently by orthopedic surgeons comparing our iTotal CR to off-the-shelf total knee replacement implants, as well as our own research and the common approach we employ in the design and manufacture of all of our products, we believe that our customized knee replacement implants offer significant benefits to patients, surgeons and hospitals that are not afforded by off-the-shelf implants.

• | For the patient. We believe that our individualized approach offers better clinical outcomes when compared to off-the-shelf implants based on the following measures: 


▪ | Better fit. Using our proprietary algorithms and computer software, we design our customized knee implants to restore the patient's own native anatomy, avoid femoral and tibial overhang and undersizing and provide proper tibial component rotation. As a result, we believe that our implants fit better, which is important to minimize pain and maintain the integrity of the implant. 


▪ | Faster recovery. We believe an individual fit requires less bone and soft tissue removal by the surgeon, resulting in less bleeding and swelling within the knee and shortened recovery times. 


▪ | Better function. We design our customized implants to match the patient's natural "J" curves, corrected for deformities caused by osteoarthritis, preserve the patient's medial and lateral joint lines, and minimize up-and-down rocking and lift-off of the patient's condyles during normal knee movement. As a result, we believe that our implants have the potential to offer a more stable, natural feeling knee with normal kinematic pattern and function. 


▪ | Greater patient satisfaction. We believe that, as a result of our customized implants fitting and functioning better, patients have greater overall satisfaction with the results of their knee replacement. 


▪ | Earlier intervention. We believe that patients who undergo knee replacement with one of our products typically retain more of their bone during the surgical procedure, as compared to patients who undergo knee replacement using an off-the-shelf implant. The more bone that is preserved, the more likely the patient will have sufficient bone available if a revision surgery is necessary. As a result, patients may undergo knee replacement surgery at an earlier age.

• | For the surgeon. We believe that our iFit technology platform offers an improved surgical procedure and greater efficiencies for surgeons when compared to knee replacements with off-the-shelf implants based on the following measures: 


▪ | Improved surgical procedure. We believe that the combination of the use of our iJigs with our customized knee implants enable a more accurate, reproducible and simplified surgical procedure by reducing the number of steps and increasing the precision of implant alignment. In our procedure, the surgeon makes a predetermined number of cuts that are specifically tailored to each patient and designed to result in a precise fit without the need for repetitive cutting of tissue and fitting of trial implants associated with an off-the-shelf knee replacement. 


▪ | Bone preservation. We believe our knee implants result in the preservation of more bone for several reasons: 


▪ | We use our iFit technology platform to design each of the bone cuts required to fit our customized implants so as to minimize bone resection and maximize bone preservation for the individual patient.


▪ | Our femoral component is fitted using six cuts of the femur as compared to the five cuts typically used with off-the-shelf implants. We reviewed an abstract presented at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the British Association for Surgery of the Knee, which studied stress and fatigue in a six-cut femoral implant model that was thinner than a five-cut model by an average of two millimeters. The six-cut implant model displayed substantially lower maximum stress than a five-cut model at a known high-stress location. At the time of the study, two of the authors of this study were our employees, and two of the authors of this study were paid consultants to us. Based in part on this data, we believe our six-cut implants can be thinner than off-the-shelf implants without sacrificing implant strength. We believe a thinner implant requires the surgeon to remove less bone during implantation. 


▪ | Our summary of a peer reviewed study of 169 implants published in Reconstructive Review in 2016 indicates that our iTotal CR showed statistically significant less bone loss resection (p≤0.05) when compared to off-the-shelf implants. At the time of the study, two of the authors of this study were our employees, and one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us. 

As a result, we believe our implants may appeal particularly to surgeons who treat young, active patients. The surgeons might otherwise recommend postponing surgery out of fear that the patient will not be eligible for a revision surgery if one becomes necessary.

▪ | Fewer post-operative issues. We believe our customized knee implants reduce the number of post-operative issues. Our review of a retrospective study of 248 patients who had undergone a total knee replacement, published in the peer-reviewed journal Arthroplasty Today in 2017, or the 2017 AT Study, indicates that patients who received an iTotal CR had significantly lower transfusion rates (p=0.005) and adverse event rates at discharge (p=0.003) and at 90 days post-discharge (p=0.023) than patients who received an off-the-shelf total knee replacement implant. We provided financial support for this study. At the time of this study, one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us. 


▪ | Greater efficiency. Because of the simplified surgical procedure used with our products, we believe total operating room time is reduced when implanting an iTotal CR as compared to an off-the-shelf implant. Our summary of the results of a retrospective study of 70 patients who had undergone total knee replacement presented at the 2015 ICJR World Arthroplasty Congress indicates that average overall operating room time was statistically significantly reduced (p=0.028) for the group of patients who received an iTotal CR in comparison with patients who received an off-the-shelf knee replacement. We believe surgeons can use these time savings to increase their productivity. 


• | For the hospital. We believe that our customized implants and iFit technology platform provide a better economic outcome for hospitals through: 


▪ | Improved implant and instrument management and reduced sterilization costs. As a result of our just-in-time delivery model, we ship our knee implants and iJigs to the hospital or other medical facility in advance of the procedure, reducing the need to store implants and instruments in the hospital. In addition, we estimate that a total knee replacement procedure using an off-the-shelf implant requires approximately five to 10 double-tiered, instrument trays, which must be cleaned, sterilized and stored 

6

between procedures at significant cost to the hospital. A knee replacement procedure using our iTotal CR product requires only one tray of reusable instruments. As a result of our just-in-time delivery approach and the reduction in the requirements for reusable instruments in procedures using our products compared to an off-the-shelf implant, we believe our products meaningfully reduce a hospital's instrument cleaning, sterilizing and storage costs.

• | Improved productivity in the OR. We believe that the iJigs we provide with our implants eliminate many of the intraoperative sizing steps and reduce the number of positioning steps necessary with an off-the-shelf product. In addition, our approach of delivering a single-package with pre-sterilized, single-use instruments allows for a more streamlined and efficient operating room through quick and easy set up and tear down. As a result, we believe that knee replacements with our customized total knee implants can improve turnaround times with the potential for more procedures to be completed within the same amount of time and for hospitals to generate additional revenue. 


• | Shorter stays. We believe that our customized total knee replacements may shorten hospital stays. Our summary of the results of the 2017 AT Study indicates that a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients who underwent total knee replacement were discharged in fewer than three days following surgery (p=0.037) in the iTotal CR group (42%) than in the off-the-shelf group (30%). Our summary of a study presented at the ICJR Pan Pacific Orthopaedic Congress in 2016, of 62 patients with either our iTotal CR or an off-the-shelf implant in a “Fast Track” protocol, also indicates that a significantly higher (p≤0.05) proportion of iTotal CR patients (66%) were discharged in less than 1 day when compared to off-the-shelf patients (30%). 


• | Economic Savings. We believe that our technology offers the potential of significant economic savings to hospitals and payors. For example, the 2017 AT Study compared adverse events rates and cost of care for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients treated with either customized individually made (CIM) implants or standard off-the-shelf (OTS) implants. In that study, the total average real hospital costs between the customized implant and OTS groups were nearly identical (customized implant $16,192 vs OTS $16,240), suggesting that patients with customized implants received improved hospital outcomes at no additional cost to the hospital. However, risk-adjusted per patient total cost of care showed a net savings of $913.87 per patient for the customized implant group for bundle of care, including the preoperative computed tomography scan, TKA hospitalization, and discharge disposition. Follow-up care costs demonstrated a savings of $1,313 per patient. 


• | Fewer adverse events. Many insurers and third-party payors, including Medicare, require the hospital to bear the cost of treating infections and post-operative adverse events if they occur within 90 days following the implant procedure. If reusable instruments are not properly prepared prior to surgery, they are a potential source of costly infections. The lower number of reusable instruments used with our knee implants reduces the possibility of contaminated instruments. Our summary of the results of the 2017 AT Study indicates that use of our iTotal CR statistically significantly reduced blood transfusion rates (p=0.005) and adverse event rates at discharge (p=0.003) as compared to an off-the-shelf knee implant. Our review of this published research, sponsored by us, also indicates that use of our iTotal CR is associated with lower adverse event rates during the 90-day period following surgery (p=0.023). The reduction in adverse events observed during the 90-day period following surgery is meaningful because hospitals may not be reimbursed for additional post-operative follow up care during this period.

Our strategy
Our objective is for our customized implants to become the standard of care for orthopedic joint replacement surgery. We believe that our iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform will enable us to offer a wide variety of customized joint replacement implants with superior performance that offer key clinical and economic benefits over off-the-shelf implants. Key elements of our strategy to achieve our objective are to:

• | Expand our sales efforts to drive adoption of our products. We systematically analyze market opportunities by considering factors such as the number of orthopedic surgeons, procedure volumes, pricing and reimbursement. We often seek to penetrate these markets by establishing relationships with influential surgeons who perform a high-volume of joint replacement procedures. We work with these surgeons to educate other surgeons. 


• | Leverage the clinical and economic benefits of our products and technologies. We believe our customized knee implant products offer important clinical and economic benefits to patients, surgeons and hospitals. Potential benefits include better function, less bone resection, less blood loss, greater patient satisfaction, reduced length of stay and lower adverse event rates. These potential economic benefits for hospitals also include reduced procedure times and reduced instrument management, cleaning and sterilization costs. We believe that our iFit technology platform will allow us to offer products for other joints that also afford important clinical and economic benefits. We have designed and sponsored studies that support these clinical and economic data. We will continue to establish these potential benefits through the design and sponsoring of studies to increase our available clinical and economic data. 


• | Broaden our product portfolio by launching additional customized orthopedic implants. While our initial focus has been on the knee implant market, we believe our iFit technology platform is applicable to customized implants for all major joints in the body and multiple implant subcategories within each joint. In 2015, we initiated the limited launch of iTotal PS, our posterior-stabilized total knee replacement implant, to address the largest segment of the knee replacement market, and we initiated the broad commercial launch of iTotal PS in March 2016. In 2017, we received clearance from the FDA for the ConforMIS Hip System, our first customized hip replacement implant, which we plan to launch on a limited basis in the second half of 2018. Additionally, we are currently developing the next generation of our iUni partial knee replacement system, which we expect to launch on a limited basis in the first half of 2019, and we are developing the next generation of our iTotal CR and iTotal PS systems. We expect to launch the next generation of the iTotal CR in the second half of 2019, including the launch of instrumentation that will be used in our next generation iTotal PS system. We also may seek to apply our iFit technology platform to develop additional product opportunities in the knee and hip replacement markets and other orthopedic markets in the longer-term, including shoulder, other extremities, spine and ligament reconstruction. 


• | Expand our just-in-time manufacturing processes. We have built state of the art manufacturing processes, including proprietary software and 3D printing capabilities. We are continuing to invest in these processes, as we believe they provide us important competitive advantages, including: 


▪ | expansion of gross margin through various initiatives, including the ongoing vertical integration of some of our manufacturing processes;


▪ | shorter product design and development time frames; and


▪ | continuous improvement of our products without making obsolete a large inventory of implants and instruments, in contrast to manufacturers of off-the-shelf implants;


• | Enhance our patent portfolio and continue to exploit our patent position. As of February 28, 2018, we own or exclusively in-license a total of approximately 420 issued patents and pending patent applications that cover customized implants and PSI for all major joints and other elements of our iFit technology platform. See Note J - "Commitments and Contingencies" in the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our patent litigation.

Our products
Knee replacement products
We offer a broad line of primary knee replacement implants, both partial and total, that we customize to fit the individual patient. Surgeons use our family of customized knee implants to treat mild to severe osteoarthritis of the knee. All of our knee replacement products have been cleared by the FDA under the premarket notification process of Section 510(k) of the FDCA and have received certification to CE Mark. We deliver our customized knee replacement implants and iJigs, together with iView, to the hospital in a single pre-sterilized package in advance of the scheduled arthroplasty procedure.
The following is an overview of each of our knee replacement implant products:

iTotal CR is the only cruciate-retaining, customized total knee replacement system on the market designed to restore the natural shape of a patient's knee. We introduced the iTotal CR in May 2011 and launched new generations in each of 2012, 2013 and 2015. The iTotal CR includes a femoral implant, a tibial tray, and dual medial and lateral polyethylene inserts, which serve as a cushion between the femoral and tibial components, all of which are individually made for the particular patient, together with a polyethylene patella designed to work with our customized components. 
The iTotal PS is the only posterior cruciate ligament substituting, or posterior-stabilized, customized total knee replacement product on the market designed to restore the natural shape of a patient's knee. We initiated a limited launch of the iTotal PS in the United States in February 2015, and we initiated the broad commercial launch of iTotal PS in March 2016. The iTotal PS includes a femoral implant with a metal cam, a tibial tray, and a single polyethylene insert, which includes a plastic spine, all of which are individually made for the particular patient, together with a polyethylene patella designed to work with our customized components.
The iDuo is the only customized bicompartmental knee replacement system on the market. The iDuo is considered a bicruciate-retaining knee replacement because the surgeon may retain both the anterior cruciate ligaments, or ACL, and posterior cruciate ligaments, or PCL. The iDuo includes a femoral implant, a tibial tray and a single polyethylene insert, all of which are individually made for the particular patient, together with a polyethylene patella designed to work with our customized components. 
The iUni is the only customized unicompartmental knee replacement product on the market for treatment of the medial or lateral compartment of the knee. The iUni is considered a bicruciate-retaining knee replacement because the surgeon retains both the ACL and PCL. The iUni includes a femoral implant, a tibial tray and a single polyethylene insert, all of which are individually made for the particular patient.

Hip replacement product
ConforMIS Hip System
As with the knee, no two hips are the same. They vary in size and shape. As is the case for knee replacements, off-the-shelf hip replacement implants are offered in a limited number of standard shapes and sizes. Also, off-the-shelf hip implants require a large number of trays of reusable instruments with the same instrument management challenges and costs of cleaning and sterilization associated with off-the-shelf knee implants. In addition, orthopedic surgery using off-the-shelf hip implants is characterized by a difficult surgical technique and can suffer from a lack of reproducibility in component placement. On June 14, 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for our ConforMIS Hip System product, and we expect to launch the system on a limited basis in the second half of 2018. We believe the introduction of the ConforMIS Hip System will provide synergies with our existing line of customized knee implants because most surgeons who perform knee replacements also perform hip replacements. Thus, we believe that the ConforMIS Hip System complements our existing product line, customer base, sales force and distribution channels.
Our proprietary iJigs
Our iJigs are customized, single-use, patient-specific instrumentation. The iJigs we deliver with our joint replacement products include the guides and instruments the surgeon requires to remove the bone and soft tissue necessary to fit our customized implant to the patient. We believe that providing our iJigs with our customized knee implants enable a more accurate, reproducible and simplified surgical procedure by reducing the number of steps and increasing the precision of the alignment.
In an off-the-shelf procedure, the surgeon must have large numbers of reusable instruments available because the surgeon does not know in advance which bone cuts and other tissue removal will be necessary to prepare the patient to receive the off-the-shelf implant. As a result, a knee replacement procedure performed using our customized implants and iJigs requires only one tray of reusable instruments, which we provide to the hospital, as compared to a knee replacement procedure using an off-the-shelf implant, which requires approximately 5 to 10 double-tiered, reusable instrument trays, which the off-the-shelf manufacturer provides to the hospital. We provide our implants with a full set of iJigs in a single package. Our iJigs arrive sterile and are discarded after use.
Clinical studies
In evaluating the clinical and economic benefits of our customized knee implants, we consider results obtained from studies sponsored by us, conducted by orthopedic surgeons who are paid consultants to us and conducted independently by orthopedic surgeons, including studies that compare our customized knee implants with off-the-shelf knee implants. As of February 28, 2018, there were 17 peer-reviewed journal articles and 45 abstracts either presented or accepted for presentation at conferences reporting on the results of clinical studies of our customized knee implants. Of the published or presented studies known to us that compared our knee replacement product to an off-the-shelf product, most reported either that the performance of our knee replacement product was superior to an off-the-shelf product on the reported measures or that there were no statistically significant differences detected between the performance of our knee replacement product and an off-the-shelf knee replacement product on those measures. 
Sales and marketing
We market and sell our products in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Austria, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Monaco. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Consolidated results of operations—Revenue" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of product revenue by geography. We market our products to orthopedic surgeons, hospitals and other medical facilities, including ambulatory surgery centers, and patients. We expect to expand the size of our sales and marketing capabilities by entering into additional direct sales, independent sales and distributor representative arrangements in key territories.
We offer technical and product focused training programs for our direct sales, independent sales and distributor representatives. We have designed these programs to provide the entire sales force with technical expertise and product knowledge so they may more effectively represent and market our products to surgeons, hospitals and other medical facilities. We believe we offer a simplified surgical technique with the use of our products that may reduce the need for our representatives to spend time in the operating room during a procedure 
10

when compared to the representatives of off-the-shelf implant manufacturers. This potentially will allow our sales representatives to spend more time on new customer growth opportunities.
We believe surgeons appreciate the clinical and economic benefits, including increased patient satisfaction, operating room efficiencies and lower adverse event rates, that we believe our products offer. We believe hospitals focus on the economic benefits that we believe are associated with our products, such as fewer instrument trays to manage, clean and sterilize, reduced operating room time, faster operating room set up and breakdown time and lower adverse event rates. We believe patients are interested in returning to daily activities quickly and are attracted to our customized approach. We employ direct-to-consumer marketing, primarily through patient testimonials, social media, search engine marketing, and print, online, radio and television news reports.
In the United States, we use a database of surgeons, hospitals and procedure volumes to determine which geographical regions are most commercially attractive. Globally, we look for markets with a high volume of total knee replacements, favorable reimbursement characteristics and an historical openness to advanced technologies. 
As part of our targeted regional commercial strategy, we identify markets in the United States based on knee replacement procedure volume, surgeon density, prevailing average selling price for a knee replacement, and other factors. We work to significantly increase our sales in these markets by focusing on high-volume, influential surgeons who use our products. We create a tailored direct marketing strategy to increase consumer awareness in these markets.
Research and development
Our internal research and development efforts are focused on continued innovation to develop customized implants for the knee and hip and to assess the application of our iFit technology platform to other major joints. 
In our research and development activities, we actively work on:

• | new product development;


• | enhancements of existing products and software;


• | improvements in our iFit technology platform to further advance production efficiency and decrease the production time from receipt of an order to delivery of our product; and


• | advancements of our iFit technology platform that will enable us to provide our customized products to a larger customer base, which we refer to as mass customization.

Our team of 31 full-time research and development employees has extensive experience in biomechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering and software engineering and development. A significant portion of our research and development activities involves the development of proprietary algorithms and computer software that underpins our entire iFit technology platform. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, company-sponsored research and development expense was $17.1 million, $16.6 million and $17.0 million, respectively.
When we develop a new product or seek to improve our existing products, our team of biomechanical and software engineers typically collaborates closely with experienced orthopedic surgeons and other independent scientists. After we complete the development of a new product or an improvement to an existing product, we seek regulatory clearance before introducing the product into patients.
Manufacturing
We conduct our manufacturing activities in state-of-the-art design and manufacturing facilities in Wilmington, Massachusetts and Wallingford, Connecticut.
We produce our CAD designs in-house and in India and use them to direct all of our product manufacturing efforts. As part of our manufacturing cost reduction efforts, in 2017, we continued expanding our CAD labor force in India. We manufacture all of our patient-specific instruments, or iJigs, tibial trays used in our total knee implants, and, starting in May 2017, polyethylene tibia tray inserts for our iTotal CR product and, starting in December 2017, our iTotal PS product, at our facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts. In August 2017, we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Broad Peak Manufacturing, LLC or BPM. Prior to the acquisition, BPM provided substantially all of the polishing services for the Company’s femoral implant component. Subsequent to the BPM acquisition, we also began to passivate our femoral implant components in our facilities in Wallingford, Connecticut. We outsource the production of the femoral and other implant components to third-party suppliers. Our suppliers make our customized implant components using the CAD designs we supply. 
11

We have established a diverse, approved supplier base that is skilled in medical device manufacturing. Our suppliers are primarily based in the United States. We do not have any long-term supply arrangements and purchase our supplies on a purchase order basis. We maintain a dual source capability for most of our purchased implant components in an effort to ensure supply reliability, flexibility and cost competitiveness. For certain raw materials, including the powders used for our 3D printing, we rely on sole source providers who service large portions of the markets for these materials.
In the future, if and as the volume of our product sales increases, we expect to take the following steps in connection with our manufacturing activities:

• | continue to increase the production of certain components of our products that we manufacture in-house, which we believe we can manufacture at a lower unit cost than vendors we currently use;


• | continue to explore applying our 3D printing technology to select metal components of our products, which we believe can lower our unit costs compared to our current manufacturing methods;


• | develop new versions of our software used in the design of our customized joint replacement implants, which we believe will reduce costs associated with the design process;


• | continue expanding our CAD labor force in India; and


• | obtain more favorable pricing of certain components of our products manufactured for us by third parties.

We also plan to explore other opportunities to reduce our manufacturing costs.
iFit 3D printing
We believe that 3D printing is especially suited for production of our patient-specific instruments. We focus on 3D printing as a key element of our manufacturing because we believe it enables fast, cost-effective, and scalable processes that will deliver high quality implants and patient-specific instruments. As a result, 3D printing plays a key role in our manufacturing operations.
We currently apply our iFit 3D printing technology to manufacture iJigs using computer-controlled lasers that melt polymer powders into a solid on a layer-by-layer basis until the entire part is completed. The process of melting powders into a solid is called sintering. We use selective laser sintering, or SLS, with approved polymer powders to manufacture plastic components for our iJigs.
We have received FDA clearance to apply our iFit 3D printing technology to manufacture the metal femoral implant component for our iTotal CR using direct metal laser sintering, or DMLS, using raw material that meets or exceeds the ASTM F-75 specification for chemical content and mechanical properties. ASTM F-75 is the accepted material standard for knee replacement femoral components. We continue to evaluate integrating DMLS into our manufacturing process.
Quality assurance
We apply a variety of automated and manual quality controls to our iJigs, implant components and other instruments we supply to ensure that our products meet specified requirements. Members of our quality department also inspect our devices at various stages during the manufacturing cycle to ensure quality to specifications. Our quality department periodically audits our suppliers to ensure compliance to appropriate ISO standards, FDA regulations and to our specifications, policies and procedures for our devices. 
We and our suppliers are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under its Quality System Regulation, or QSR. The QSR requires manufacturers to establish and follow quality systems consistent with the QSR framework to ensure that their products consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications. In accordance with the QSR framework, we have validated and/or verified the processes used in the manufacturing and testing of our devices. Our Wilmington and Wallingford manufacturing facilities are FDA registered, and we believe they are compliant with the FDA's QSR. We have also received certification from the British Standards Institution, or BSI, a Notified Body to the International Standards Organization of our quality system. Certification by a Notified Body is a necessary element of obtaining CE Marking in the EU. We are subject to periodic, announced and unannounced inspections by BSI, the FDA, and other governmental agencies. We continue to monitor our quality system and management efforts in order to maintain our overall level of compliance. See "—Regulatory requirements" below.

Intellectual property
Protection of our intellectual property is an important priority for our company. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary rights for our products and technology, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our intellectual property position by, among other things, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our products and technology where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
We typically seek patents on inventions relating to customized implants and iJigs, and on their methods of manufacture. We generally file patent applications in the United States, the major markets in the EU, and in select other commercially important countries. We typically rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary algorithms that we use to design customized implants and iJigs.
Patent rights
As of February 28, 2018, we owned or exclusively in-licensed 215 issued patents around the world, including 148 patents issued in the United States and 67 foreign patents.

• | With respect to the patents that we own relating primarily to our customized joint replacement implants, the first nonprovisional application was filed in 2002 claiming priority to a provisional application filed in 2001 and is expected to expire in 2022 and the other patents are expected to expire between 2022 and 2030.


• | With respect to the patents that we own relating primarily to our patient-specific instrumentation, the first nonprovisional application was filed in 2002 claiming priority to a provisional application filed in 2001 and is expected to expire in 2022 and the other patents are expected to expire between 2022 and 2031.


• | With respect to the patents that we own relating primarily to our iFit technology platform, the first nonprovisional application was filed in 2002 claiming priority to a provisional application filed in 2001 and is expected to expire in 2022 and the other patents are expected to expire between 2022 and 2032.

As of February 28, 2018, we owned or exclusively in-licensed 205 patent applications, including 59 patent applications pending in the United States and 146 foreign patent applications.

• | With respect to the patent applications that we own relating primarily to our customized joint replacement implants, patient-specific instrumentation, and our iFit technology, the first were filed in 2001 and if patents issue on these applications, they would be expected to expire in 2022 and if patents issued on the other patent applications, such patents would be expected to expire between 2023 and 2036. Our patent portfolio covers a range of subject matter, including: 


• | customized articular implants for the knee, hip, spine, shoulder, ankle and extremities;


• | customized instrumentation including for joint replacement and ligament reconstruction;


• | imaging technology;


• | 3D printing technology for implants and instruments;


• | methods of designing customized implants and instruments; and


• | methods of manufacturing customized implants and instruments.

Licenses from others
We are a party to several agreements under which we have licensed rights in certain patents, patent applications and other intellectual property. We enter into these agreements to augment our proprietary intellectual property portfolio. The licensed intellectual property covers some of the products that we are researching, developing and commercializing and some of the technologies that we use. These licenses impose certain license fee, royalty payment and diligence obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future. We do not believe that any of these licenses are material to our business.
Patent litigation
On February 29, 2016, we filed a lawsuit against Smith & Nephew, Inc., or Smith & Nephew, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts Eastern Division, which we amended on June 13, 2016, or the Smith & Nephew Lawsuit. The Smith & Nephew Lawsuit alleges that Smith & Nephew’s Visionaire® patient-specific instrumentation as well as the implants systems used in conjunction with the Visionaire instrumentation 
13

infringe nine of our patents, and it requests, among other relief, monetary damages for willful infringement, enhanced damages and a permanent injunction.
On May 27, 2016, Smith & Nephew filed its Answer and Counterclaims in response to our lawsuit, which it subsequently amended on July 22, 2016. Smith & Nephew denied that its Visionaire® patient-specific instrumentation as well as the implants systems used in conjunction with the Visionaire instrumentation infringe the patents asserted by us in the lawsuit. It also alleged two affirmative defenses: that the patents that we asserted are invalid and that we are barred from relief under the doctrine of laches. In addition, Smith & Nephew asserted a series of counterclaims, including counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments that Smith & Nephew’s accused products do not infringe our patents and our patents are invalid. Smith & Nephew also alleged that we infringe ten patents owned or exclusively licensed by Smith & Nephew: two patents that Smith & Nephew alleges are infringed by our iUni and iDuo products; three patents that Smith & Nephew alleges are infringed by our iTotal products; and five patents that Smith & Nephew licenses from Kinamed, Inc. of Camarillo, California and that it alleges are infringed by our iUni, iDuo and iTotal products. Due to Smith & Nephew’s licensing arrangement with Kinamed, Kinamed was named as a party to the lawsuit. Smith & Nephew and Kinamed requested, among other relief, monetary damages for willful infringement, enhanced damages and a permanent injunction. On March 9, 2017, the Court entered a stipulation of dismissal by the parties that dismissed from the lawsuit eight patents asserted by Smith & Nephew, including the patents involving Kinamed, and two patents asserted by us.
Between September 21, 2016 and March 1, 2017, Smith & Nephew filed sixteen petitions with the United States Patent & Trademark Office, or USPTO, requesting Inter Partes Review, or IPR, of the nine patents that we asserted against Smith & Nephew in the lawsuit. In its petitions, Smith & Nephew alleged that our patents are obvious in light of certain prior art.  As of October 31, 2017, the USPTO decided to institute IPR proceedings with respect to seven of the petitions; decided to deny the requests for IPR with respect to seven of the petitions; and, with respect to the remaining two petitions, decided to institute IPR proceedings for some of the subject patent claims and to deny the requests for the remaining subject patent claims. In total, the USPTO instituted IPR proceedings for some or all of the subject patent claims in six of the patents in the Smith & Nephew lawsuit (five patents that are currently asserted, and one of the patents that was voluntarily dismissed from the lawsuit), and denied the petitions for all subject claims in three of the patents (two patents that are currently asserted and one of the patents that was voluntarily dismissed from the lawsuit).  Smith & Nephew filed requests for rehearing in three of the petitions that were either partially or completely denied and filed requests for reexamination of two of the patents for which no IPR was instituted.  The requests for rehearing were denied.
On January 27, 2017, Smith & Nephew filed a motion seeking a stay of the Smith & Nephew Lawsuit until any requested Inter Partes Reviews are resolved, and we filed an opposition to that motion. On April 27, 2017, the Court stayed certain aspects of the proceedings and indicated that it will make a final decision on the motion to stay after the USPTO has decided more of the petitions for Inter Partes Review.  We are presently unable to predict the outcome of the motion to stay the proceedings, the instituted IPRs, the reexaminations, or the Smith & Nephew Lawsuit. An adverse outcome of some or all of the IPR proceedings, the reexamination or the Smith & Nephew Lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Licenses to others
License agreement with MicroPort
In April 2015, we entered into a worldwide license agreement with MicroPort. Under the terms of this license agreement, we granted a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to MicroPort to use patient specific instrument technology covered by our patents and patent applications with off-the-shelf implants in the knee. This license does not extend to patient-specific implants. This license agreement provides for the payment to us of a fixed royalty at a high single to low double digit percentage of net sales on patient specific instruments and associated implant components in the knee, including MicroPort's Prophecy patient specific instruments used with its Advance and Evolution implant components. This license agreement also provided for a single lump-sum payment by MicroPort to us of low-single digit millions of dollars upon entering into the license agreement, which has been paid. This license agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire of our patents and patent applications licensed to MicroPort, which currently is expected to occur in 2029.
License agreement with Wright Medical
In April 2015, we entered into a non-exclusive, fully paid up, worldwide license agreement with Wright Medical. Under the terms of this license agreement, we granted a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to Wright 
14

Medical to use patient-specific instrument technology covered by our patents and patent applications with off-the-shelf implants in the foot and ankle. This license does not extend to patient-specific implants. This license agreement provided for a single lump-sum payment by Wright Medical to us of mid-single digit millions of dollars upon entering into the license agreement, which has been paid. This license agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire of the patents and patent applications licensed to Wright Medical, which currently is expected to occur in 2031.
Trademarks
As of February 28, 2018, we have filed 152 trademark registrations in the United States and in other major markets worldwide, including the following marks: ConforMIS, iFit, iTotal, iDuo, and iUni. We have 18 trademark applications pending in the United States and in other major markets worldwide.
Competition
The joint replacement industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and sensitive to the introduction of new products or other market activities of industry participants. We face competition from many different sources, including major medical device companies.
We compete with several large, well-known companies that dominate the market for orthopedic products, principally Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., or Zimmer Biomet, Stryker Corporation, or Stryker, DePuy Synthes, Inc., or DePuy, a Johnson & Johnson company and Smith & Nephew, Inc., or Smith & Nephew. These competitors have significantly greater financial resources, larger sales forces and networks of distributors, a greater number of established relationships, some of which may be exclusive, with key orthopedic surgeons, hospitals and third-party payors, and greater experience in research and development, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory clearances and marketing approved products than we do. These companies also compete with us in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, the development of our products and recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, engineering and management personnel.
We also compete with numerous other companies that are developing and marketing competitive joint replacement products, as well as companies exploring alternatives to joint replacement such as biologic cartilage repair systems.
We believe that the principal factors on which we compete with others in our market include:

• | the ability to introduce innovative products that are differentiated from competitors' offerings and represent an improvement over currently available products;


• | the ease of use of the products and the quality of training, services and clinical support provided to surgeons and hospitals;


• | the safety and efficacy of products and procedures, as demonstrated in published studies and other clinical reports;


• | the ability to anticipate and meet customers' needs and commercialize new products in a timely manner;


• | acceptance and adoption of products by patients, physicians and hospitals; and


• | the price of products and cost effectiveness of the procedure and availability and rate of third-party reimbursement.

The prices that we charge our customers for our products vary from customer to customer based on such factors as the volume of product being purchased, geographic region, reimbursement environment and competitive factors. We believe that our current pricing for our products generally is within the same range as that of our principal competitors, with a premium of five percent on average.
Regulatory requirements
Our medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and other authorities in the United States and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU. These governmental authorities regulate the introduction of medical devices into their respective geographies within their jurisdiction. The regulations cover the entire life cycle of the product, including the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, storage, labeling, advertising and promotion of the devices. In addition, post-approval monitoring and reporting, as well as import and export of medical devices, are subject to regulatory requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances in the United States and in foreign countries and 
15

jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review, approval and clearance of medical devices in the United States
Medical devices in the United States are strictly regulated by the FDA. Under the Code of Federal Regulation, 21 CFR Parts 800-1299, Food and Drugs, a medical device is defined as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory, which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.
Unless an exemption applies, a new medical device may not be marketed in the United States unless it has been cleared by the FDA through filing of a 510(k) premarket notification, or 510(k), or cleared by the FDA pursuant to a premarket approval application, or PMA. The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA and the novelty of the medical device. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes depending on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class I devices have the lowest level or risk associated with them, and are subject to general controls, including labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the QSR. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to most of the aforementioned requirements as well as to premarket approval. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirement, although manufacturers of these devices are still subject to registration, listing, labeling and QSR requirements.
To date, we have used the 510(k) premarket notification process to obtain regulatory clearance from the FDA for the marketing, sale and distribution of our joint replacement products in the United States. All of our currently marketed products are Class II devices marketed pursuant to 510(k) clearances. On June 14, 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of our ConforMIS Hip System. 
To date, none of our submissions to the FDA have entered the premarket approval stages or required the submission of clinical data. However, we have conducted and continue to conduct numerous post-market studies aimed at demonstrating the clinical benefits of our customized knee replacement systems as compared to off-the-shelf systems.
Review and approval of medical devices in the EU
The EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC, as amended) sets out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the European Union. In the EU, our medical devices must comply with the Essential Requirements in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, which we refer to as the Essential Requirements. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the Certificate of Conformity mark, or CE Mark, to our medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the European Economic Area, or EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue a CE Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a third-party organization designated by competent authorities of an EU country to conduct conformity assessments, which is referred to as a Notified Body. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine products' technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements.
To date, we have used the CE Marking process to satisfy the conformity standards required to market and sell our joint replacement products in the EU. The Notified Body that has conducted conformity assessments with respect to our joint replacement products is the BSI.
Even after we receive a CE Certificate of Conformity enabling us to affix the CE Mark on a product and to sell our product in the EEA countries, a Notified Body or a competent authority may require post-marketing studies of our product. Failure to comply with such requirements in a timely manner could result in the withdrawal of our CE 
16

Certificate of Conformity and the recall or withdrawal of our product from the market in the EU, which would prevent us from generating revenue from sales of that product in the EEA. Moreover, each CE Certificate of Conformity is valid for a maximum of five years, but more commonly three years. Our current CE Certificates of Conformity are valid through May 8, 2021 for our iTotal CR product, December 2, 2022 for our iUni product, June 11, 2019 for our iDuo product and March 5, 2020 for our iTotal PS product. At the end of each period of validity we are required to apply to the Notified Body for a renewal of the CE Certificate of Conformity. There may be delays in the renewal of the CE Certificate of Conformity or the Notified Body may require modifications to our products or to the related Technical Files before it agrees to issue the new CE Certificate of Conformity.
In addition, we must inform the Notified Body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical devices we market or sell in the EEA of any planned substantial changes to our devices that could affect compliance with the Essential Requirements or the devices' intended purpose. The Notified Body will then assess the changes and verify whether they affect the products' conformity with the Essential Requirements or the conditions for the use of the devices. If the assessment is favorable, the Notified Body will issue a new CE Certificate of Conformity or an addendum to the existing CE Certificate of Conformity attesting compliance with the Essential Requirements. If it is not, we may not be able to continue to market and sell the product in the EEA.
The European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals designed to replace the existing regulatory framework for medical devices in the EU. These proposals provide for a revision of the current regulatory framework for medical devices in the EU to strengthen patient safety, transparency and product traceability. The proposals, for instance, include reinforced rules governing clinical evaluation throughout the life of the device, improved traceability of devices in the supply chain, including a phased and risk-based introduction of unique device identification, or UDI, improved market surveillance and vigilance, as well as better co-ordination between national regulators, increased powers for Notified Bodies to undertake unannounced inspections and strengthened supervision of Notified Bodies by member states. These new regulations, adopted April 5, 2017, and expected to be fully implemented within 3 years, may prevent or delay the EU approval or clearance of our products under development or may impact our ability to modify our currently EU approved or cleared products on a timely basis and impose additional costs relating to clinical evaluation, vigilance and product traceability.
Marketing and sales considerations in the EU
In the EU, medical devices may be promoted only for the intended purpose for which the devices have been CE Marked. Failure to comply with this requirement could lead to the imposition of penalties by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. The penalties could include warnings, orders to discontinue the promotion of the medical device, seizure of the promotional materials and fines. Promotional materials must also comply with various laws and codes of conduct developed by medical device industry bodies in the EU governing promotional claims, comparative advertising, advertising of medical devices reimbursed by the national health insurance systems and advertising to the general public.
Product vigilance and post-approval monitoring in the EU
Additionally, all manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. In the EU, manufacturers must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU countries, and manufacturers are required to take field safety corrective actions, or FSCAs, to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. See "Risk Factors—Risks related to regulatory approval—If our products, or malfunction of our products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions, which could harm our business."
Third-party reimbursement
In the United States and most other major joint implant markets, many third-party payors, including government health programs, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, reimburse hospitals and other medical facilities an aggregate amount for all elements of a joint replacement procedure, including operating room time, patient care and the joint replacement product. As a result, our products generally are not reimbursed separately, but instead are subject to the limits imposed by third-party payors on the coverage and reimbursement of procedures that utilize our products.
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of such procedures involving the use of our products cleared by the FDA and approved by other government authorities will be covered by third-party 
17

payors, including government health programs in the United States, such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a particular procedure may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the procedure once coverage is approved. Third party payors may limit coverage to particular procedures on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved procedures involving the use of our products for a particular indication.
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. In many foreign markets, pricing of medical devices is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to limit payments by governmental payors for medical devices, and the procedures in which medical devices are used. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.
In January 2017, the rate of reimbursement for surgical procedures using our products in Germany was changed. Previously, all procedures in which our products were used were reimbursed under the same reimbursement code, or “Sonderprothesen”, OPS code 5.822.91. Beginning January 1, 2017, the reimbursement for surgical procedures using our iTotal CR and iTotal PS products increased by approximately 3.7%, while the reimbursement for surgical procedures using our iUni products decreased by approximately 36.3%, and the reimbursement for surgical procedures using our iDuo products decreased by approximately 27.0%. We believe that the change in the rate of reimbursement for surgical procedures using our iTotal CR and iTotal PS products has not materially impacted sales in Germany. However, the decrease in the rate of reimbursement for surgical procedures using our iUni and iDuo products has adversely impacted our sales in Germany. 
Healthcare laws and regulations
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and selection of medical devices for patients. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:

• | the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;


• | the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;


• | the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;


• | the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law require manufacturers of devices, drugs and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.

State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating 
18

compliance efforts. In particular, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is a regulation in the European Union, or EU, that, among other things, unifies data protection regulation within the EU and governs the export of certain personal data and health information of citizens of the EU. The regulations will be enforced beginning May 25, 2018, following a two-year transition period.
Financial information about segments and geographic areas
We operate as one reportable segment as described in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The countries in which we have local revenue generating operations have been combined into the following geographic areas: the United States (including Puerto Rico), Germany, and the rest of the world, which consists of the United Kingdom predominately and several other foreign countries. Sales are attributable to a geographic area based upon the customer’s country of domicile. Net property, plant and equipment are based upon physical location of the assets. Additional financial information about geographic areas is included in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are exposed to risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures, import or export requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, differing regulatory requirements, government-managed healthcare systems, government-mandated pricing and reimbursement and health technology assessment schemes, government-mandated collection periods, patient privacy laws and regulations, and other data privacy laws and regulations.
