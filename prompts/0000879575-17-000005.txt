ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
        "Notes" referenced throughout this document refer to financial statement note disclosures that are found in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Overview
Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. ("TNCLP," "we," "our" or "us") is a Delaware limited partnership that produces nitrogen fertilizer products. Our principal products are anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) and urea ammonium nitrate solutions (UAN), which we manufacture at our facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma.
We conduct our operations through an operating partnership, Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP or the Operating Partnership, and collectively with TNCLP, the Partnership). Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP or the General Partner), a Delaware corporation, is the general partner of both TNCLP and TNLP and owns a 0.025% general partner interest in each of TNCLP and TNLP. The General Partner is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF Industries), a Delaware corporation. Ownership of TNCLP is composed of the general partner interests and the limited partner interests. Limited partner interests are represented by common units, which are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TNH" and Class B common units. As of December 31, 2016, we had 18,501,576 common units and 184,072 Class B common units issued and outstanding. CF Industries through its subsidiaries owned 13,889,014 common units (representing approximately 75.1% of the total outstanding common units) and all of the Class B common units as of December 31, 2016.
CF Industries, through its subsidiaries, is a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of nitrogen products, serving both agricultural and industrial customers. CF Industries operates world-class nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and distributes plant nutrients through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 2.2 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers, recognized net sales of $418.3 million and generated net earnings of $209.3 million. Additional financial information about our business is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
TNCLP and TNGP have no employees. Affiliates of the General Partner provides certain services to us under the Amendment to the General and Administrative Services and Product Offtake Agreement (the Services and Offtake Agreement). Pursuant to the Services and Offtake Agreement, the Partnership sells all of its fertilizer products to affiliates of the General Partner at prices based on market prices for the Partnership's fertilizer products as defined in the Services and Offtake Agreement. Title and risk of loss transfer to affiliates of the General Partner as the product is shipped from the plant gate. For further information regarding our agreements with CF Industries and the General Partner, see Note 10—Related Party Transactions.
We are a master limited partnership (MLP). Partnerships are generally not subject to federal income tax, although publicly traded partnerships (such as TNCLP) are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes (and therefore are subject to federal income tax), unless at least 90% of the partnership's gross income is "qualifying income" as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As we currently satisfy the requirements to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, no federal income taxes are paid by the Partnership.
On January 19, 2017, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a MLP. For calendar year MLPs, the effective date of the regulations is January 1, 2018. The regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the MLP rules, subject to certain transition provisions. The regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource (including fertilizer) as activities that generate qualifying income, but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizer-related activities. However, the IRS has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to TNCLP which would indicate that each taxpayer's fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether 90% of the partnership's gross income is qualifying income. The entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours.  While this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the IRS analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued, this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity. Thus, the IRS is not bound to follow it in respect of TNCLP, nor may we rely on it

as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the MLP 90% gross income test. Any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizer-related activities as qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of the Partnership and could have a material adverse impact on unitholder distributions. We continue to monitor these IRS regulatory activities.
Throughout this document, references to "affiliates of the General Partner" refer to consolidated subsidiaries of CF Industries, including TNGP. CF Industries acquired Terra Industries, Inc. (Terra) in April 2010, and acquired the General Partner and Terra's ownership in the Partnership at that time.
We make available free of charge through CF Industries' Internet website, www.cfindustries.com, all of our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed electronically with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Copies of the General Partner's Corporate Governance Guidelines and charters for the Audit Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the General Partner's Board of Directors (TNGP Board of Directors) are also available on CF Industries' Internet website. We will provide electronic or paper copies of these documents free of charge upon written request delivered to our principal executive offices at the address below. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
Our principal executive offices are located outside of Chicago, Illinois, at 4 Parkway North, Suite 400, Deerfield, Illinois 60015.
Product Tons and Nutrient Tons
Unless otherwise stated, we measure our production and sales volume in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in product tons, which represents the weight of the product measured in short tons (one short ton is equal to 2,000 pounds).  
We also provide certain supplementary volume information measured in nutrient tons. Nutrient tons represent the weight of the product’s nitrogen content, which varies by product. Ammonia product tons represent 82% nitrogen content and UAN product tons assume a 32% nitrogen content basis.  
Our Products
Our principal products are ammonia and UAN, which we manufacture at our Verdigris, Oklahoma facility. Our nitrogen products are used primarily by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. Although ammonia and UAN are often interchangeable, each has its own characteristics, and customer product preferences vary according to the crop planted, soil and weather conditions, regional farming practices, relative prices and the cost and availability of appropriate storage, handling and application equipment.
Our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the following table. The sales shown do not reflect product used internally in the manufacture of other products (for example, in 2016 we used approximately 0.7 million tons of ammonia in the production of UAN).

 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014 
 | Tons | Sales | | Tons | Sales | | Tons | | Sales
 | (tons in thousands; sales dollars in millions)
Nitrogen Fertilizer Products | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Ammonia | 409 | | $ | 132.2 | | 418 | | | $ | 199.5 | | 331 | | $ | 150.7
UAN | 1,759 | | 284.4 | | 1,668 | | | 379.2 | | | 1,937 | | 494.4

Our gross margin was $226.8 million, $325.8 million and $386.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Our Facilities
Our sole production facility, in Verdigris, Oklahoma, is the second largest UAN production facility in North America. It has two ammonia plants, two nitric acid plants and two UAN plants, providing us with some flexibility to adjust our product mix between ammonia and UAN. It has the annual capacity to produce approximately 1.2 million tons of ammonia (most of which is upgraded to UAN) and 2.0 million tons of UAN. The Verdigris facility represents approximately 5% of North American ammonia capacity and 13% of North American UAN capacity.

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1) | Gross ammonia production, including amounts subsequently upgraded to UAN.

Our Verdigris location is well suited to serve the midwestern U.S. corn belt. Verdigris is strategically located on approximately 800 acres near Tulsa's Port of Catoosa on the Verdigris River. We lease a port terminal from the Tulsa-Rogers County Port Authority, which provides access to transport fertilizer by way of river barges. In addition, Verdigris is located on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, providing access to rail transport. We also have access to a 1,100-mile ammonia pipeline. The complex has on-site storage for 60,000 tons of ammonia and 100,000 tons of UAN, providing us with flexibility to handle temporary disruptions to shipping activities without impacting production.
Our capital expenditures are primarily related to plant maintenance and turnaround projects to sustain our asset base, to increase capacity, to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements. Occasionally, we have had other capital expenditure projects related to items such as the installation of new plant control systems or construction of additional on-site storage, including the construction of a new 50,000 ton capacity UAN tank that was completed in 2015. Planned capital expenditures and plant turnarounds are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals and/or permitting, unanticipated increases in cost, changes in scope and completion time, performance of third parties, adverse weather, defects in materials and workmanship, labor or material shortages, transportation constraints, and other unforeseen difficulties. Capital expenditures also reduce the Available Cash (as defined in our agreement of limited partnership) for unitholder distributions.
Customers
We sell all of the fertilizer products that we produce to affiliates of the General Partner, making it our only customer.
Raw Materials
Natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in our ammonia production process. In 2016, natural gas accounted for approximately 58% of our total cost of goods sold for nitrogen fertilizers and a higher percentage of cash production costs (total production costs less depreciation and amortization). Our Verdigris facility has access to abundant, competitively-priced natural gas through a transportation arrangement connecting it to ONEOK Gas Transportation, L.L.C.'s intrastate pipeline system.
In 2016, our Verdigris facility consumed approximately 41 million MMBtus of natural gas. We purchase natural gas from a variety of suppliers to maintain a reliable, competitively-priced supply of natural gas. We also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices. For further information about our natural gas hedging activities, see Note 7—Derivative Financial Instruments.
Distribution
Our production facility in Verdigris is located near the agricultural areas of the midwestern United States, and has ready access to barge, truck and rail transportation. In addition, the Verdigris facility has access to an ammonia pipeline to transport product to high demand regions.
Competition
The market for nitrogen fertilizer products is global and intensely competitive. Competition in the nitrogen fertilizer market is based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality. During the peak demand periods, product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers. Agrium Inc., Koch Nitrogen Company, CVR Partners, LP, LSB Industries, Inc. and CF Industries are all large North American-based producers of nitrogen fertilizer products. Additionally, Iowa Fertilizer Company and Yara BASF are expected to bring new nitrogen fertilizer production facilities located in North America on line in 2017. There is also significant competition from product sourced from other regions of the world, including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs.

Seasonality
The fertilizer business is seasonal. However, the sales pattern of our business can change significantly from year to year due to weather conditions and other factors impacting the agricultural industry. The strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. Wholesale buyers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation; the generation, treatment, storage, disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases. These laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Toxic Substances Control Act and various other federal, state and local statutes. Violations can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment.
We may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental, health and safety laws in the future. Additionally, future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures. Our costs to comply with, or any liabilities under, these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.
Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners, Limited Partnership (a former owner and operator of the Partnership's production facilities) has retained liability for certain environmental matters originating prior to the Partnership's acquisition of these facilities.
Environmental, Health and Safety Expenditures
Our environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in 2016 totaled approximately $3.5 million. In 2017 we estimate that we will spend approximately $0.8 million for environmental, health and safety capital expenditures. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations. Such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.
Legislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases
We are subject to greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued federal GHG regulations that impact our facility, including a mandatory GHG reporting rule that required us to commence monitoring GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2010 and begin reporting the previous year's emissions annually starting in 2011. In addition, if we seek to modify or expand our facility and as a result are required to obtain a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) air construction permit, we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to GHGs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants. Such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such facility modifications and expansions.
On December 12, 2015, 195 countries, including the United States, adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement has been accepted by the United States and went into effect in November 2016. However, as a result of the recent presidential election, the United States may decide to withdraw from the Paris Agreement (or the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which would also result in withdrawal from the Paris Agreement) or, prior to taking such actions, could disregard its commitments under the Paris Agreement. The impact of such actions, if they take place, on the future implementation of the

TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.

Paris Agreement is uncertain. If the Paris Agreement remains in effect, it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce GHG emissions. There are substantial uncertainties as to the nature, stringency and timing of any future regulations. More stringent GHG limitations, if they are enacted, are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facility emits GHGs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas, a fossil fuel, is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process. Regulation of GHGs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs, reduce our efficiency, limit our output, require us to make capital improvements to our facilities, increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy, raw materials or transportation, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders. In addition, to the extent GHG restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the United States, our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us.
New Source Performance Standards for Nitric Acid Plants
On August 14, 2012, the EPA issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed, reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants. The regulations will apply to our nitric acid plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications, including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at the plants. The regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants, and, accordingly, the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants. The EPA regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide (a greenhouse gas).
Employees
TNCLP and TNGP have no employees. An affiliate of the General Partner provides services to us under the Services and Offtake Agreement.
