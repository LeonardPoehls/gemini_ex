General
 
West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc.
 
West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Maryland in June 2011 for the purpose of becoming the savings and loan holding company for West End Bank, S.B. (the “Bank”), upon consummation of the mutual to stock conversion of West End Bank, MHC, the Bank’s former mutual holding company, which occurred on January 10, 2012. Other than owning the Bank and making a loan to the Bank’s employee stock ownership plan, the Company has engaged in no material operations to date.
 
As a registered savings and loan holding company, West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. is authorized to pursue other business activities permitted by applicable laws and regulations, which may include the acquisition of banking and financial services companies. See “Supervision and Regulation –Holding Company Regulation” for a discussion of the activities that are permitted for savings and loan holding companies. We currently have no understandings or agreements to acquire other financial institutions although we may determine to do so in the future. We may also borrow funds for reinvestment in West End Bank, S.B.
 
West End Bank, S.B.
 
West End Bank, S.B. is an Indiana-chartered savings bank headquartered in Richmond, Indiana. West End Bank, S.B. was organized in 1894 under the name West End Building and Loan Association and has operated continuously in Richmond, Indiana since its founding. We reorganized into the mutual holding company structure in 2007 by forming West End Bank, MHC; and completed our mutual to stock conversion in January 2012, thereby becoming the wholly owned subsidiary of West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. At December 31, 2017, we had total assets of $299.4 million, net loans of $240.9 million, total deposits of $227.0 million and equity of $29.0 million.

Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, and to a lesser extent, borrowings, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, indirect automobile loans, commercial and multi-family real estate loans, and, to a lesser extent, second mortgages and equity lines of credit, construction loans and commercial business loans. We also purchase investment securities consisting primarily of securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored entities and mortgage-backed securities.
 
West End Bank is a community bank with a broadened base of financial products and services while continuing to emphasize superior customer service associated with our traditional thrift focus. Residential real estate lending has and will remain an important part of our operations, however, we have also expanded our focus into non-residential lending, including in particular indirect automobile lending. Our consumer lending business lines and our interest rate risk strategies (such as selling most of the fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate) have allowed us to continue to grow and remain profitable despite the challenging economy and interest rate environment of recent years and increasing regulatory burden placed on all financial institutions.
 
Our website address is www.westendbank.com. Information on this website should not be considered a part of this annual report.
 
Market Area and Competition
 
We primarily conduct business through our main office located in Richmond, Indiana and our three branch offices in Richmond, Hagerstown and Liberty, Indiana. Three of our offices are located in Wayne County, Indiana and our Liberty office is located in Union County, Indiana. Richmond, Indiana is located in east/central Indiana on the Interstate 70 corridor, approximately 70 miles east of Indianapolis, Indiana and 35 miles west of Dayton, Ohio. In addition to our four full-service locations, we also host seven additional limited service branches in select schools within Richmond Community Schools. These student-operated branches are currently featured in all six Richmond Community Elementary Schools and are in operation once a month. We also have a limited service branch and ATM located within Richmond High School. This student-operated branch is available to students and faculty of RCS twice a week.
 
Our primary market area consists of Union and Wayne Counties, Indiana, and select parts of western Ohio with respect to commercial and multi-family real estate lending, and to a lesser extent, indirect automobile lending. This area includes small towns and rural communities. Our market area was historically a manufacturing and agricultural-based economy. In recent years, the economy has transitioned into a more service-oriented base, including health care, educational facilities and distribution services. Most notable, Wayne County is home to Reid Hospital & Health Care Services and four universities; Earlham College, Indiana University East, Purdue Polytechnic Institute and Ivy Tech Community College.
 
The regional economy is fairly diversified, with services, wholesale/retail trade, manufacturing and government providing the primary support for the area economy. The population of Wayne County decreased slightly from 69,003 in 2010 to 66,568 in 2016 which is a decrease of 3.5%. The population of Union County decreased slightly from 7,516 in 2010 to 7,212 in 2016 which is a decrease of 4.0% (Stats Indiana.) Our lack of population growth and our general market conditions may limit our ability to grow our assets and liabilities at a rapid rate. To counter this, in addition to our traditional means of advertising, we have also employed digital channels most specifically but not limited to Google ad network advertising and social media. In addition, we are implementing strategies to optimize search engine capabilities. Our school branch initiative enhances our ability to attract smaller deposit relationships, nurture them and in turn grow our brand awareness with a younger generation of potential customers. We also specialize in offering a superior suite of products, services and customer service to small and mid-sized companies in our market area.

Wayne and Union Counties’ and Indiana’s annual unemployment rates for 2016 were 4.8%, 4.0% and 4.4%, respectively, as compared to a U.S. unemployment rate of 4.7% (December 2016). This was an overall decrease from 2015. 2016 per capita personal incomes for Wayne and Union Counties were $37,624 and $35,175, respectively, and 2016 median household incomes for these counties were $42,983 and $46,862 compared to 2016 per capita income for the state of Indiana and the United States of $43,097 and $49,571 respectively, and 2016 median household incomes of $52,289 and $57,617, respectively (statsindiana.edu, census.gov, statista.com)
 
We face competition within our market area both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a concentration of financial institutions that include large regional banks, community banks and credit unions. As of June 30, 2017, based on the most recent available FDIC data, our market share of deposits represented 16.79% and 32.56% of FDIC-insured deposits in Wayne and Union Counties, Indiana, respectively.
 
Lending Activities
 
Our principal lending activity is originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans, indirect automobile loans, commercial and multi-family real estate loans, second mortgages and equity lines of credit, construction loans and commercial business loans. In recent years, we have increased and expect to continue to increase, our indirect automobile loans and our commercial business loans, which serves to strengthen the overall yield earned on our loans and shorten asset duration. As a long-standing community lender, we believe we can effectively compete for this business by emphasizing superior customer service and local underwriting, which we believe differentiates us from larger commercial banks in our primary market area.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Pursuant to applicable law, the aggregate amount of loans that we are permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15% of West End Bank, S.B.’s unimpaired capital and surplus (25% if the amount in excess of 15% is secured by “readily marketable collateral” or 30% for certain residential development loans). At December 31, 2017, our largest credit totaled $3.8 million and was secured by real estate used for student hoursing and account/notes recievable and inventory, which was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at this date. Our second largest at this date was a $3.3 million loan secured by multi-family real estate. At December 31, 2017, this loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms.
 
Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations. The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items on the application are verified through use of credit reports, financial statements and tax returns.
 
Our President and Chief Executive Officer has approval authority of up to $750,000 for one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial and multi-family loans and commercial business loans, and up to $100,000 for unsecured consumer loans. Our Senior Vice President and Credit Manager has approval authority of up to $250,000 for one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial and multi-family loans and commercial business loans, and up to $25,000 for unsecured consumer loans. Loans above the amounts authorized to our President and Chief Executive Officer require approval by the Loan Committee, which consists of our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and three outside board members, which may approve loans of up to $1,500,000. These approvals are reported at the next board meeting following approval. Aggregate credit exposure in excess of $1,500,000 must be approved by a majority of the full Board of Directors.
 
Generally, we require title insurance on our mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property, depending on the type of loan. We also require flood insurance if the improved property is determined to be in a flood zone area.

One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending. The focus of our lending program has historically been the origination of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2017, $61.9 million, or 25.4% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of loans secured by one- to four-family real estate.
 
We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2017, 77.5% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans, and 22.5% of such loans were adjustable-rate loans.
 
At December 31, 2017, $9.2 million, or 14.8% of our total one- to four-family residential real estate loans were secured by non-owner occupied properties. Generally, we require personal guarantees from the borrowers on these properties and will not make loans in excess of 80% loan to value on non-owner- occupied properties. However, we recognize that there is a greater credit risk inherent in non-owner- occupied properties, than in owner-occupied properties since, like commercial real estate and multi-family loans, the repayment of these loans may depend, in part, on the successful management of the property and/or the borrower’s ability to lease the property. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing these loans or the revenues derived from these properties which could affect the borrower’s ability to repay the loan.
 
Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans are generally underwritten according to Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency for Freddie Mac, which as of December 31, 2017 was generally $453,000 for single-family homes in our market area. We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which are referred to as “jumbo loans.” The majority of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are secured by properties located in our market area.
 
We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our mortgage loans to 80% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower. Loans with certain credit enhancements, such as private mortgage insurance, may be made with loan-to-value ratios up to 97%.
 
Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of 15 or 30 years.
 
Our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans generally have fixed rates for initial terms of five years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin, which in recent years has been 4.50% over the weekly average yield on U.S. treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2% per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally 6% over the initial interest rate of the loan. Our adjustable-rate loans carry terms to maturity of up to 30 years.
 
Although adjustable-rate mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically reprice, as interest rates increase the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by the maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments permitted by our loan documents. Moreover, the interest rates on most of our adjustable-rate loans do not adjust for up to five years after origination. As a result, the effectiveness of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in compensating for changes in general interest rates may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates.

We do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on permanent one- to four-family residential real estate loans (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer “subprime loans” on one-to four- family residential real estate loans (i.e., loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios), or “Alt-A” (i.e., loans that generally target borrowers with better credit scores who borrow with alternative documentation such as little or no verification of income).
 
We actively monitor our interest rate risk position to determine the desirable level of investment in fixed-rate mortgages. Depending on market interest rates and our capital and liquidity position, we may retain all of our newly originated longer-term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, or we may sell all or a portion of such loans in the secondary mortgage market. In recent years, we have sold, and may continue to sell, subject to market conditions, most of the conforming fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate to Freddie Mac, with servicing retained.
 
Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending. Consistent with our strategy to expand our loan products and to enhance the yield and reduce the term to maturity of our loan portfolio, we have increased our commercial and multi-family real estate loans in recent years. At December 31, 2017, we had $57.5 million in commercial and multi-family real estate loans, representing 23.6% of our total loan portfolio. Subject to future economic, market and regulatory conditions, we intend to continue to focus on this kind of lending, and may increase our loan activity for these types of loans in western Ohio.
 
Most of our commercial and multi-family real estate loans have fixed-rate terms of up to five years with amortization terms of 25 years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans is generally 80%.

We consider a number of factors in originating commercial and multi-family real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). All commercial and multi-family real estate loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by the board of directors or by internal evaluations, where permitted by regulation. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial and multi-family real estate loans.
 
Commercial and multi-family real estate loans entail greater credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans because they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial and multi-family real estate than residential properties.
 
Indirect Consumer Lending. As part of our effort to enhance our net interest margin and the interest rate risk sensitivity of our loan portfolio, we originate indirect automobile loans, including on a selective basis, recreational vehicle and boat loans. Indirect consumer loans totaled $86.1 million at December 31, 2017, or 35.3% of our total loan portfolio. 
 
We acquire and underwrite our indirect automobile loans from approximately 40 dealers located primarily in our market area under a tiered-rate structure providing for a dealer reserve premium. The aggregate principal balance of our automobile loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017 was secured primarily by late-model used automobiles. The weighted average current term to maturity of our automobile loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 was 5 years and 8 months.

At December 31, 2017 the average credit score for borrowers of our indirect loans that were originated since May 2008 was 680, and the weighted average rate of these loans was 6.65%. At December 31, 2017, $23.0 million, or 26.7% of our total indirect loan portfolio, consisted of automobile loans where the borrower’s credit score was 660 or less (a possible indication of a less credit-worthy borrower).
 
Each dealer that originates automobile loans makes representations and warranties with respect to our security interests in the related financed vehicles in a separate dealer agreement with us. These representations and warranties do not relate to the creditworthiness of the borrowers or the collectability of the loan. The dealers are also responsible for ensuring that our security interest in the financed vehicles is perfected.
 
Each automobile loan requires the borrower to keep the financed vehicle fully insured against loss or damage by fire, theft and collision. The dealer agreements require the dealers to represent that adequate physical damage insurance (collision and comprehensive) was in effect at the time the related loan was originated and financed by us. In addition, we have the right to force place insurance coverage (supplemental insurance taken out by West End Bank, S.B.) in the event the required physical damage insurance on an automobile is not maintained by the borrower. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that each financed vehicle will continue to be covered by physical damage insurance provided by the borrower during the entire term during which the related loan is outstanding. As additional protection, each borrower is required to obtain Vendor Secured Interest (VSI) insurance on each automobile loan.
 
Each dealer submits credit applications directly to us, and the borrower’s creditworthiness and the age of the automobile are the most important criteria we use in determining whether to purchase an automobile loan from a dealer. Each credit application requires that the borrower provide current information regarding the borrower’s income, employment history, debts, and other factors that bear on creditworthiness. We generally apply uniform underwriting standards when originating the automobile loan although on occasion we will underwrite loans outside of these guidelines. We also obtain a credit report from a major credit reporting agency summarizing the borrower’s credit history and paying habits, including such items as open accounts, delinquent payments, bankruptcies, repossessions, lawsuits and judgments.
 
The borrower’s credit score and the age of the car are the principal factors used in determining the interest rate and term on the loan. Our underwriting procedures evaluate information relating to the borrower and supplied by the borrower on the credit application combined with information provided by credit reporting agencies and the amount to be financed relative to the value of the related financed vehicle. Additionally, our underwriters may also verify a borrower’s employment income and/or residency or where appropriate, verify a borrower’s payment history directly with the borrower’s creditors. Based on these procedures, a credit decision is considered and approved either automatically or by our personnel at various levels of authority. We generally follow the same underwriting guidelines in originating direct automobile loans.
 
We generally finance up to the full sales price of the vehicle plus sales tax, dealer preparation fees, license fees and title fees, plus the cost of service and warranty contracts and premiums for physical damage, credit life and disability insurance obtained in connection with the vehicle or the financing (amounts in addition to the sales price are collectively referred to as the “Additional Vehicle Costs”). In addition, we may finance the negative equity related to the vehicle traded in by the borrower in connection with the financing. Accordingly, the amount we finance may exceed, depending on the borrower’s credit score in the case of new vehicles, the dealer’s invoice price of the financed vehicle and the Additional Vehicle Costs, or in the case of a used vehicle, the vehicle’s value and the Additional Vehicle Costs. The maximum amount borrowed generally may not exceed 100% of the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the financed vehicle that is new, or the vehicle’s “retail” value in the case of a used vehicle, including Additional Vehicle Costs. The vehicle’s value is determined by using one of the standard reference sources for dealers of used cars. We regularly review the quality of the loans we purchase from the dealers and periodically conduct quality control audits to ensure compliance with our established policies and procedures. We retain the right to recapture the individual dealer reserve if the loan should default within 120 days.

Generally, automobile loans have greater risk of loss or default than one- to four-family residential real estate loans. We face the risk that any collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. Thus, the recovery and sale of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the principal outstanding on these loans. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit our ability to recover on such loans. However, we have attempted to address these inherent risks by lending primarily on late-model used vehicles for which, generally, most of the asset’s rapid depreciation has already occurred. Additionally, we actively monitor delinquencies and losses on our indirect loans to each dealership that originates the loan, and we limit and/or discontinue future loans with dealerships that we deem to contain additional risk to our underwriting.
 
Direct Consumer Lending. Our direct consumer loans, including unsecured loans, totaled $18.0 million or 7.4% of our total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2017 and consisted principally of loans secured by a wide variety of collateral, including certificates of deposit and marketable securities. Unsecured consumer loans included in the above amount totaled $419,000 or 0.17% of our total loan portfolio. These loans have either a fixed-rate of interest for a maximum term of 60 months, or are revolving lines of credit with an adjustable-rate of interest tied to the prime rate of interest as reported in The Wall Street Journal. 
 
Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities.
 
Consumer loans generally have greater risk compared to longer-term loans secured by improved, owner-occupied real estate, particularly consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
 
Second Mortgage Loans and Equity Lines of Credit. At December 31, 2017, $6.6 million, or 2.7% of our loan portfolio were second mortgage loans and equity lines of Credit. We offer second mortgage loans and equity lines of credit secured by a first or second mortgage on residential property. Second mortgage loans and equity lines of credit are made with fixed or adjustable rates, and with combined loan-to-value ratios up to 90% on an owner-occupied principal residence.
 
Second mortgage loans and equity lines of credit have greater risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by first mortgages. We face the risk that the collateral will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses and costs of foreclosure. When customers default on their loans, we attempt to foreclose on the property and resell the property as soon as possible to minimize foreclosure and carrying costs. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from those customers. Particularly with respect to our second mortgage loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans.

At December 31, 2017, the average loan balance of our outstanding home equity lines of credit was $22,000 and the largest outstanding balance of any such loan was $234,000. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2017.
 
Construction Lending. At December 31, 2017, we had $2.1 million, or 0.9% of our total loan portfolio, in construction loans. We make construction loans to individuals for the construction of their primary residences. These loans generally have maximum terms of 12 months, and upon completion of construction convert to conventional amortizing mortgage loans. Our construction loans have rates and terms comparable to one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate. During the construction phase, the borrower generally pays interest only. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our owner-occupied construction loans is generally 80% of construction costs or completed-appraised-value, whichever is less. Residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent residential mortgage loans. On occasion, we may consider loans for the construction of commercial properties.
 
To a lesser extent, we will make loans for the construction of “presold” homes. No more than two such loans may be outstanding to one builder/borrower at any time. These loans generally have initial maximum terms of nine months, although the term may be extended to up to 18 months. The loans generally carry variable rates of interest. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of these construction loans is generally 80% of construction costs or completed-appraised-value, whichever is less.
 
Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Construction loans also expose us to the risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated.
 
Commercial Business Lending. At December 31, 2017 commercial business loans represented $11.6 million, or 4.8% of our total loan portfolio. Our commercial business loans consist of term loans as well as regular lines of credit and revolving lines of credit to finance short-term working capital needs like accounts receivable and inventory. Our commercial lines of credit are generally priced on an adjustable-rate basis and may be secured or unsecured. We generally obtain personal guarantees with all commercial business loans. Business assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, furniture and fixtures may be used to secure lines of credit. Our lines of credit typically have a maximum term of 12 months. We also originate commercial term loans to fund long-term borrowing needs such as purchasing equipment, property improvements or other fixed asset needs. We fix the maturity of a term loan to correspond to 80% of the useful life of any equipment purchased or seven years, whichever is less. Term loans can be secured with a variety of collateral, including business assets such as accounts receivable and inventory or long-term assets such as equipment, furniture, fixtures or real estate.

Unlike one- to four-family residential real estate loans, which we generally originate on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, we typically originate commercial business loans on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business or rental income produced by the property. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business or rental property itself and the general economic environment. Therefore, commercial business loans that we originate have greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans or, generally, consumer loans. In addition, commercial business loans often result in larger outstanding balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers, and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts.
 
At December 31, 2017, the average loan balance of our outstanding commercial business lines of credit was $95,000, and the largest outstanding balance of such loans was a $919,000 loan secured by marketable securities. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2017.
 
We believe that commercial business loans will provide growth opportunities for us, and we expect to increase, subject to our conservative underwriting standards and market conditions, this business line in the future. The additional capital we receive in connection with the stock offering will increase our maximum lending limits and will allow us to increase the amounts of our loans to one borrower.
 
We also offer commercial loans utilizing the Small Business Administration’s 7a Program.  The 75% loan guaranty provided under the SBA program reduces our credit risk.  In addition, the guaranteed portion of the credit can be sold in the secondary market generating significant fee income opportunities.  We face recourse liability on these loans if they do not meet all SBA requirements. We address this risk by utilizing a third-party SBA partner which specializes in underwriting, portfolio composition and servicing of SBA credit facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we originated SBA guaranteed commercial loans of $2.6 million.  The guaranteed portion of those loans originated in 2017 was sold for a gain of $143,000.
 
Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans
 
We originate real estate and other loans through marketing efforts, our customer base, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate brokers, builders and attorneys. All loans originated by us are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures.
 
We may sell a certain amount of the loans we originate into the secondary market and in recent years, based upon our interest rate risk analysis, we have sold most of the fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originated to Freddie Mac, although we are also approved to sell to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. On an ongoing basis, we consider our balance sheet as well as market conditions in making decisions as to whether to hold the mortgage loans we originate for investment or to sell such loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. To date, all of our loan sales have been on a servicing-retained basis. At December 31, 2017, we serviced $71.6 million of fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans held by other institutions.

From time to time, we purchase loan participations secured by properties within and outside of our primary lending market area in which we are not the lead lender. Historically, the loan participations have been secured by commercial and multi-family real estate. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies.
 
The following table sets forth our loan origination, sale and principal repayment activity during the periods indicated. There were no loans purchased during the years presented.

Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets
 
Delinquency Procedures. When a borrower fails to make a required monthly loan payment by the last day of the month, a late notice is generated stating the payment and late charges due. Our policies provide that borrowers are first contacted by phone or mail when they are 16 to 21 days past due to determine the reason for nonpayment and to discuss future payments. Once the loan is considered in default, a certified letter is sent to the borrower explaining that the entire balance of the loan is due and payable. If the borrower does not respond, we will initiate foreclosure proceedings. If the loan is reinstated, foreclosure proceedings will be discontinued and the borrower will be permitted to continue to make payments.
 
When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed real estate held for sale until it is sold. The real estate is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition less estimated costs to sell, and any write-down resulting from the acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Estimated fair value is based on a new appraisal which is obtained as soon as practicable, typically after the foreclosure process is completed. Subsequent decreases in the value of the property are charged to operations. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.
 
Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”). We occasionally modify loans to extend the term or make concessions to help a borrower stay current on his or her loan and to avoid foreclosure/repossession.  We generally do not forgive principal or interest on loans. We may modify the terms of loans, to lower interest rates (which may be at below market rates), defer delinquent payments, and/or to provide for longer amortization schedules (up to 40 years on loans secured by real estate), and/or provide for interest-only terms. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and that is in our best interests.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, there was one new restructuring classified as TDR. The loan balance at December 31, 2017 was $738,000 with a pre-modification recorded balance and a post modification recorded balance of $738,000. Modifications include continuation of interest-only payment for a six month time period on the $738,000 TDR balance, and deferment of principal payments. During the year ended December 31, 2016 there were no new restructuring classified as TDRs. No loans restructured during the last twelve months defaulted during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management.
 
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
 
In connection with the filing of our periodic reports and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the “watch list” initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing as agreed, or delinquency status, or if the loan possesses weaknesses although currently performing. Management reviews the status of each impaired loan on our watch list on a quarterly basis with the Directors’ Loan Committee and then with the full Board of Directors. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to “special mention,” “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status and classified “substandard.”
 
See Note 3 to our Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this annual report for a description by loan category of our classified and special mention assets as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
 
Non-Performing Assets. We generally cease accruing interest on our loans when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans generally is applied against principal. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. Restructured loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the revised contractual terms for a reasonable period of time (typically six months) and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured.

The following table sets forth information regarding our non-performing assets and troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated. Troubled debt restructurings include loans for which either a portion of interest or principal has been forgiven, or for loans modified at interest rates materially less than current market rates.

Allowance for Loan Losses
 
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses. Our allowance for loan losses is the amount considered necessary to reflect probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.
 
Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements: (1) specific allowances for identified impaired loans; and (2) a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio.
 
We identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans, classified loans, and other loans about which management may have concerns about collectability. For individually reviewed loans, the borrower’s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan as well as the shortfall in collateral value would result in our charging off the loan or the portion of the loan that was impaired.
 
Among other factors, we consider current general economic conditions, including current housing price depreciation, in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses for our residential real estate portfolio. We use evidence obtained from our own loan portfolio as well as published housing data on our local markets from third party sources we believe to be reliable as a basis for assumptions about the impact of housing depreciation. We have increased general and specific allowances for our residential real estate loans over the past several quarters, in part, because the values of residential real estate in our local markets securing our portfolio have declined significantly and may continue to decline.
 
Substantially all of our loans are secured by collateral. Loans 90 days past due and other classified loans are evaluated for impairment and general or specific allowances are established. Typically for a nonperforming real estate loan in the process of collection, the value of the underlying collateral is estimated using the original independent appraisal, adjusted for current economic conditions and other factors, and related general or specific reserves are adjusted on a quarterly basis. If a nonperforming real estate loan is in the process of foreclosure and/or there are serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, and there is uncertainty about the value of the underlying collateral, we will order a new independent appraisal. Any shortfall would result in immediately charging off the portion of the loan that was impaired.

--

Specific Allowances for Identified Problem Loans. We establish a specific allowance when loans are determined to be impaired. Loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. Factors in identifying a specific problem loan include: (1) the strength of the customer’s personal or business cash flows; (2) the availability of other sources of repayment; (3) the amount due or past due; (4) the type and value of collateral; (5) the strength of our collateral position; (6) the estimated cost to sell the collateral; and (7) the borrower’s effort to cure the delinquency. In addition, for loans secured by real estate, we consider the extent of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral on the mortgage.
 
General Valuation Allowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio. We establish a general allowance for loans that are not classified as impaired to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, has not been allocated to particular problem assets. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience, delinquency trends and management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio. The allowance may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management’s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary market area, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current real estate environment.
 
As an integral part of their examination process, the FDIC and the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.

At December 31, 2017, our allowance for loan losses represented 1.13% of total loans and 333.54% of nonperforming loans, and at December 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.97% of total loans and 174.62% of nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans decreased primarily due to a $2.2 million commercial property that was transferred to foreclosed real estate held for sale during 2016 and subsequently sold in 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $2.7 million at December 31, 2017 and was $2.3 million at December 31, 2016, due to a provision for loan losses of $2.0 million, offset by net charge-offs of $1.6 million during 2017. Net charge-offs for 2017 included $1.2 million in consumer loans secured by autos, $129,000 in commercial credits, $99,000 in commercial and multifamily real estate loans, $72,000 in secured residential real estate, and $9,000 in second mortgages and home equity lines of credit
 
Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, regulators, in reviewing our loan portfolio, may request us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and increases may be necessary should the quality of any loan deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Investment Activities
 
General. The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to help mitigate our interest rate risk, and to generate a favorable return on idle funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. In recent years beginning with the recession which began in 2008 and the subsequent challenging economic environment, our strategy has been to reduce the maturities of our investment securities portfolio. Subject to loan demand and our interest rate risk analysis, we may increase the balance of our investment securities portfolio when we have excess liquidity.
 
Our board of directors is responsible for adopting our investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed annually by management and any changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to the approval of the board of directors. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. All investment transactions are reviewed quarterly by the board of directors.
 
Our current investment policy permits, with certain limitations, investments in securities issued by the United States Government and its agencies or government sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and, to a lesser extent, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposits in other financial institutions, investments in bank-owned life insurance, collateralized mortgage obligations, asset-backed securities, real estate mortgage investment conduits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and debt securities of state and political subdivisions.
 
At December 31, 2017, we did not have an investment in the securities of any single non-government issuer that exceeded 10% of our equity at that date.

Our current investment policy does not permit investment in stripped mortgage-backed securities, complex securities and derivatives as defined in federal banking regulations and other high-risk securities. Our current policy does not permit hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities.
 
At December 31, 2017, none of the collateral underlying our securities portfolio was considered subprime or Alt-A, and we did not hold any common or preferred stock issued by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae as of that date.
 
Municipal Bonds. At December 31, 2017, the carrying value of municipal bonds in our portfolio totaled $2.0 million. These securities generally provide similar or higher yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio. While they do not provide the liquidity of other securities, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for tax planning, as collateral for borrowings and for prepayment protection.
 
Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2017, the carrying value of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio totaled $18.3 million. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass-through” certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of one- to four-family or multifamily mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as West End Bank, S.B. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. Most of our mortgage-backed securities are either backed by Ginnie Mae, a United States Government agency, or government-sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 
Residential mortgage-backed securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored entities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank Stock. We hold common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis in connection with our borrowing activities totaling $2.4 million at December 31, 2017. The common stock of such entity is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities.
Bank-Owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us non-interest income that is non-taxable. At December 31, 2017, our investment in bank-owned life insurance totaled $7.0 million and was issued by four insurance companies.

Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis advances, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. To a lesser extent, we may utilize repurchase agreements or Federal Fund Sold as funding sources
Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. We have not in the past nor presently have any brokered deposits. However, dependent on our future needs for, we could utilize this avenue for liquidity purposes.
 
In recent years, we have focused on deposit generation from small- and mid-sized businesses and professionals in our market area through aggressive marketing campaigns, including our Business Links program, a selection of commercial deposit services, including deposit pick-up services and, as requested, remote capture. Additionally, we offer non-conforming loan products on one- to four-family residential real estate loans in connection with which the borrower is required to open a money market deposit account with us.
 
Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. Personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers, and the favorable image of West End Bank, S.B. in the community are relied upon to attract and retain deposits.
 
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. Our ability to gather deposits is impacted by the competitive market in which we operate which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products. We often use promotional rates to meet asset/liability and market segment goals.
 
The variety of deposit accounts offered allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on our experience, we believe that non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing checking, money market and savings accounts may be somewhat more stable sources of deposits than certificates of deposits. Also, we believe that our deposits allow us a greater opportunity to connect with our customers and offer them other financial services and products. As a result, we have used marketing and other initiatives to increase such accounts. However, it can be difficult to attract and maintain such deposits at favorable interest rates under current market conditions.

Borrowings. At December 31, 2017 our borrowings consisted of $41.5 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. We may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis upon the security of our capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and certain of our mortgage loans. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile.
 
From time to time during recent years, we have utilized short-term borrowings to fund loan demand. To a limited extent, we have also used borrowings where market conditions permit to purchase securities of a similar duration in order to increase our net interest income by the amount of the spread between the asset yield and the borrowing cost. From time to time, we have obtained advances with terms of more than one year to extend the term of our liabilities.
 
At December 31, 2017, based on available collateral and our ownership of FHLB stock, and based upon our internal policy, we had access to additional Federal Home Loan Bank advances of up to $8.0 million.
 
The following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on our Federal Home Loan Bank advances at the date and for the periods indicated.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
General
 
West End Bank, S.B. is examined and supervised by the Division of Banking of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s deposit insurance fund and depositors. These regulators are not, however, generally charged with protecting the interests of stockholders of West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. Under this system of state and federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates. West End Bank, S.B. also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, which is one of the twelve regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. West End Bank, S.B.’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal and state laws, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of West End Bank, S.B.’s mortgage documents.
 
The Indiana Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have extensive enforcement authority over Indiana-chartered savings banks, such as West End Bank, S.B. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders, to assess civil money penalties and to initiate injunctive actions. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe and unsound banking practices.
 
The Indiana Department of Financial Institutions has established a schedule for the assessment of “supervisory fees” for all Indiana savings banks to fund the operations of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions. These supervisory fees are computed on the basis of each savings bank’s total assets (including consolidated subsidiaries) and are payable at the end of each calendar quarter. A schedule of fees has also been established for certain filings made by Indiana savings banks with the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions. The Indiana Department of Financial Institutions also assesses fees for examinations conducted by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions’ staff, based upon the number of hours spent by the staff performing the examination. During the year ended December 31, 2017, West End Bank, S.B. paid approximately $23,800 in supervisory fees and no examination fees. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation does not assess fees for its examination and supervisory activities.
 
The material regulatory requirements that are applicable to West End Bank, S.B. and West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on West End Bank, S.B. and West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions, the Federal Reserve Board, or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. and West End Bank, S.B., and their operations.

As a savings and loan holding company, West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. is required to file certain reports with, and is subject to inspection and supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and has affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision on July 21, 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies like West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc., in addition to bank holding companies which it regulates. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board’s regulations applicable to bank holding companies, including holding company capital requirements, apply to savings and loan holding companies like West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc., unless an exemption exists. These capital requirements are substantially similar to the capital requirements currently applicable to West End Bank, S.B. as described in “–Federal Banking Regulation–Capital Requirements.” The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital are restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $500 million are exempt from these capital requirements. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets. The legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within 18 months that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as West End Bank, S.B., including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
 
The legislation also broadens the base for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance assessments. Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. Lastly, the Dodd-Frank Act increases stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.
 
Savings Bank Regulation 
 
As an Indiana savings bank, West End Bank, S.B. is subject to federal regulation and supervision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and to state regulation and supervision by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions. West End Bank, S.B.’s deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. West End Bank, S.B. is not a member of the Federal Reserve System.

Both federal and Indiana law extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business such as reserve requirements, truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings disclosures, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting, trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations. Current federal law also requires savings banks, among other things, to make deposited funds available within specified time periods.
 
Under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, an insured state chartered bank, such as West End Bank, S.B., is prohibited from engaging as principal in activities that are not permitted for national banks, unless: (i) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation determines that the activity would pose no significant risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund and (ii) the bank is, and continues to be, in compliance with all applicable capital standards.
 
Branching and Interstate Banking.  The establishment of branches by West End Bank, S.B. is subject to approval of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and geographic limits established by state laws. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “Riegle-Neal Act”) facilitates the interstate expansion and consolidation of banking organizations by permitting, among other things, (i) bank holding companies that are adequately capitalized and managed to acquire banks located in states outside their home state regardless of whether such acquisitions are authorized under the law of the host state, (ii) the interstate merger of banks, subject to the right of individual states to “opt out” of this authority, and (iii) banks to establish new branches on an interstate basis provided that such action is specifically authorized by the law of the host state.
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. In order for West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the Federal Reserve Board (rather than as a bank holding company by the Federal Reserve Board), West End Bank, S.B. must satisfy the “qualified thrift lender” or “QTL,” test. Under the QTL test, West End Bank, S.B. must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings bank, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings bank’s business.
 
West End Bank, S.B. also may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
 
At December 31, 2017, West End Bank, S.B. maintained 67% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and has met the qualified thrift lender test in each of the last 12 months.
 
Transactions with Related Parties. A savings bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as West End Bank, S.B. West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. is an affiliate of West End Bank, S.B. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements. In addition, applicable regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. Applicable regulators require savings banks to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates.

West End Bank, S.B.’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% or greater stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders:
 

(i) | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features, and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of West End Bank, S.B.’s capital.
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved in advance by West End Bank, S.B.’s Board of Directors.
 
Capital Requirements. Under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, state-chartered banks, such as West End Bank, S.B., are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital requirement consisting of a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 3% if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation determines that the institution is not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and has well-diversified risk, including no undue interest rate risk exposure, excellent asset quality, high liquidity, good earnings, and in general, a strong banking organization, rated composite 1 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (the CAMELS rating system) established by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. For all but the most highly rated institutions meeting the conditions set forth above, the minimum leverage capital ratio is 4%. Tier 1 capital is the sum of common stockholders’ equity, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock (including any related surplus) and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, minus all intangible assets (other than certain mortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card relationships, credit-enhancing interest-only strips and certain deferred tax assets), identified losses, investments in certain financial subsidiaries and non-financial equity investments.
 
In addition to the leverage capital ratio (the ratio of Tier I capital to total assets), state chartered banks must maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8%, of which at least half must be Tier 1 capital. Qualifying total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital (also referred to as supplementary capital) items. Tier 2 capital items include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, cumulative preferred stock and preferred stock with a maturity of over 20 years, certain other capital instruments and up to 45% of pre-tax net unrealized holding gains on equity securities. The includable amount of Tier 2 capital cannot exceed the institution’s Tier 1 capital. Qualifying total capital is further reduced by the amount of the bank’s investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for regulatory capital purposes, reciprocal cross-holdings of capital securities issued by other banks, most intangible assets and certain other deductions. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation risk-weighted system, all of a bank’s balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of certain off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk-weight categories from 0% to 100%, based on the risks inherent in the type of assets or item. The aggregate dollar amount of each category is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that category. The sum of these weighted values equals the bank’s risk-weighted assets.
 
In July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule applies to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more and top-tier savings and loan holding companies. Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-in or opt-out is exercised. The rule limits a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule becomes effective for West End Bank on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and ending January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective.

Dividend Limitations. The primary source of West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc.’s cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends on West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc.’s common stock, is the payment of dividends to West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. by West End Bank, S.B. Under Indiana law, West End Bank, S.B. may pay dividends of so much of its undivided profits (generally, earnings less losses, bad debts, taxes and other operating expenses) as is considered expedient by West End Bank, S.B.’s board. However, West End Bank, S.B. must obtain the approval of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by West End Bank, S.B. during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would exceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, “retained net income” means net income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. Also, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the supervisory authority to prohibit West End Bank, S.B. from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of West End Bank, S.B. In addition, since West End Bank, S.B. is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, West End Bank, S.B. must file a notice with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago at least 30 days before the board of directors of West End Bank, S.B. declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) of the FDIC up to $250,000 per depositor for each ownership category. The FDIC assesses premiums on the Bank based on a risk-based assessment system and the amount of deposits held by the institution.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Bank does not believe that it is taking or is subject to any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target ratio for the DIF from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC, and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-term fund ratio of 2%.
 
All FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on obligations issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.  The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019.  For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.54 cents for each $100 in domestic deposits maintained at an institution.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Bank expensed $167,000 related to the FICO bonds and deposit insurance assessments.

Federal Home Loan Bank System. West End Bank, S.B. is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, West End Bank, S.B. is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2017, West End Bank, S.B. was in compliance with this requirement.
Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), West End Bank, S.B. has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in connection with its examination of West End Bank, S.B., to assess its record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by West End Bank, S.B. For example, the regulations specify that a bank’s CRA performance will be considered in its expansion (e.g., branching) proposals and may be the basis for approving, denying or conditioning the approval of an application. As of the date of its most recent regulatory examination, West End Bank, S.B. was rated “satisfactory” with respect to its CRA compliance.
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the statute establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may order savings banks which have insufficient capital to take corrective actions. For example, a savings bank which is categorized as “undercapitalized” would be subject to growth limitations and would be required to submit a capital restoration plan, and a holding company that controls such a savings bank would be required to guarantee that the savings bank complies with the restoration plan. A “significantly undercapitalized” savings bank would be subject to additional restrictions. Savings banks deemed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to be “critically undercapitalized” would be subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.
 
West End Bank, S.B. is “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules.
 
The recently proposed rules that would increase regulatory capital requirements would adjust the prompt corrective action categories accordingly.
 
Qualified Mortgages and Retention of Credit Risk
 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this “qualified mortgage” definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s rule, a “qualified mortgage” loan must not contain certain specified features, including:

· | excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less “bona fide discount points” for prime loans);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | interest-only payment;
--+-----------------------


· | negative-amortization; and
--+---------------------------


36
--


· | terms longer than 30 years
--+---------------------------

 
Also, to qualify as a “qualified mortgage,” a borrower’s total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrow for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive/and or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.
 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the regulatory agencies to issue regulations that require securitizers of loans to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk for any assets that is not a “qualified residential mortgage.” The regulatory agencies have issued a proposed rule to implement this requirement. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that the definition of “qualified residential mortgage” can be no broader than the definition of “qualified mortgage” issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for purposes of its regulations (as described above). Although the final rule with respect to the retention of credit risk has not yet been issued, the final rule could have a significant effect on the secondary market for loans and the types of loans we originate, and restrict our ability to make loans.
 
Other Regulations
 
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by West End Bank, S.B. are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. West End Bank, S.B.’s operations are also subject to federal and state laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

· | The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires savings banks operating to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.

Holding Company Regulation
 
General. West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. is a non-diversified unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and subject to inspection and supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. is subject to the Federal Reserve Board regulations (including applicable regulations of the former Office of Thrift Supervision), and reporting requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. and its non-insured subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution.
Capital.  Savings and loan holding companies have not historically been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. However, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set for all depository institution holding companies minimum consolidated capital levels that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act as to savings and loan holding companies. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions will apply to savings and loan holding companies as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer will be phased in between 2016 and 2019.
Dividends. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy guidance regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Federal Reserve Board guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition.  The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized.  These regulatory policies could affect the ability of West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory agencies must issue regulations requiring that all bank and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 
Permissible Activities. Under present law, the business activities of West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and certain additional activities authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulations.
 
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc., directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a nonsubsidiary company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
 
The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions:
 

(i) | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.

TAXATION
 
Federal Taxation
 
General. West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. and West End Bank, S.B. are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc. and West End Bank, S.B.
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, West End Bank, S.B. currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31st for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by savings institutions, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995.
Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, referred to as “alternative minimum taxable income.” The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2017, West End Bank, S.B. had no minimum tax credit carry forward.
Corporate Dividends. We may exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from West End Bank, S.B. as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
 
Audit of Tax Returns. West End Bank, S.B.’s federal income tax returns have not been audited in the most recent five-year period.
 
State Taxation
 
Indiana State Taxation. West End Indiana Bancshares, Inc., and West End Bank, S.B. are subject to Indiana’s Financial Institutions Tax (“FIT”), which is imposed at a flat rate of 8.0% on apportioned “adjusted gross income.” “Adjusted gross income,” for purposes of FIT, begins with taxable income as defined by Section 63 of the Code, and thus, incorporates federal tax law to the extent that it affects the computation of taxable income. Federal taxable income is then adjusted by several modifications pursuant to Indiana tax regulation.
 
Other applicable state taxes include generally applicable sales and use taxes plus real and personal property taxes. West End Bank, S.B.’s state income tax returns have not been audited in recent years.
