Item 1. Business
Summary
 
Cyclone Power Technologies, a Florida corporation (OTCQB: CYPW) (the “Company,” “Cyclone,” or “we,” “our” is a clean-tech innovation company based in Pompano Beach, Florida. We were incorporated on July 5, 2007. Our mission is to develop power technologies that lead to more efficient and diverse utilization of energy resources, less dependence on fossil fuels, and a cleaner environment.
 
Since 2006, we have completed multiple prototype stages and received 33 patents on the Cyclone Engine, an external heat engine that generates mechanical power by expanding super-heated steam rapidly inside its cylinders. This steam expansion pushes pistons and turns a shaft. Hot water is then expelled into a condenser to cool and return to the external heat source to repeat the process in a closed loop. This is a Rankine cycle, which is how nuclear and coal-fired power plants produce electricity.
 
What makes the Cyclone Engine different from power plants is size. Cyclone Engines are compact systems that can be used for distributed power generation (i.e., a small electric home generator that also co-generates hot water and space heating) and transportation applications. Unlike power plants that use turbines which are difficult to build cost-effectively and run efficiently in small sizes, we are designing our engines to be easy to manufacture, to be high performance, and to be compact piston engines.
 
What makes the Cyclone Engine different from piston steam engines of the past is efficiency. Based on current testing, we are able to convert up to approximately 33% of the energy content of fuel into usable power. This is approximately a 400% improvement over historical steam engines and on par with today’s small diesel engines. We are able to achieve such high thermal efficiencies because we have figured out how to run our engines without using lubricating oil which carbonizes at high temperatures. Without that limitation we are able to utilize steam heated to the same temperature and pressures as used by large power plants. High temperature = high efficiency; and high pressure = high power density.
 
What makes the Cyclone Engine more useful than diesel engines is fuel diversity. As an external heat engine that uses steam to create mechanical power, how that steam is created is of little consequence. We can use traditional fossil or bio-fuels in our patented, clean-burning combustion chamber. We can integrate our engine with gasifiers that dispose biomass and bio-waste. We can capture exhaust heat from furnaces or other engines. We can even use solar thermal collectors to harness the energy of the sun.
 
The market opportunities for Cyclone Engines are vast. We estimate that our technology addresses a market potential of roughly $100+ billion, and touches virtually all areas of power generation and transportation, as well as the production of U.S bio-fuels, natural gas and coal.
 
We currently have four engines in development addressing markets that present what we believe to be the best and most immediate opportunities:
 

● | Our Mark 1 and Mark 3 model engines address the alternative energy markets to provide an external combustion engine able to burn various fuels providing power for usable mechanical and/or electric power. Our business model is to subcontract the manufacturing of these models. This was done in 2017. These are now being readied to sell to commercial customers, vertical partners and distributors in 2018.

● | Transportation and Equipment: Our Mark 5 model engine is a powerful, multi-fuel and clean burning demonstrator for the automotive, marine and off-road equipment markets. We have now secured a strong investment partner for funding and support that will allow us to complete heavy equipment and vehicle integration in 2018. 
● | Portable / Mobile Power: Our S-2 model engine was developed and accepted under a contract with the U.S. Army as a portable, multi-fuel power generator for vehicles and forward operating bases. Falck Schmidt Defense Systems (“FSDS”) of Denmark, has filed bankruptcy due to non-renewal of bank loans. The owner Falck Schmidt has started a new Company and has asked to continue as a worldwide military supplier. They will take the unit to a trial for military compliance. Solar Microgrid System: We have a Mark 10 drawn and is going into CAD. The first 1500 horsepower unit is projected to be tested by the end of 2018. The Cyclone solar trough is being manufactured by an American solar company and the Thermal Storage Unit will also be built and tested this year for the 1 Megawatt Microgrid Market. The new investment group is facilitating integration of our engine with their Solar products. 

 
The advantages of our technology have been widely recognized. We first caught the public eye as Popular Science Magazine’s Invention of the Year in 2008, and since then, we have secured engine development contracts with Raytheon, the U.S. Army, Phoenix Power Group (waste-to-energy), Combilift (European equipment manufacturer). FSDS (military supplier) and Integrated Biomass Energy System, FZ-LLC (“IBES”), a United Arab Emirates corporation. We have formed working relationships with other major defense and industrial groups, and teaming agreements with multiple “vertical” development partners that manufacture and distribute furnaces, gasifiers, electric generators and other synergistic technologies.


Business Objectives
 
Our business objective is to design and develop engines that we can manufacture through sub-contracted parties for direct sale to customers, which include Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of different clean combustion / heat technologies (such as biomass gasifiers and pyrolysis, methane and natural gas, wood pellet furnaces, solar collectors and similar items), and OEM’s in the equipment / transportation sectors. We also license our technology to manufacturers and other producers of specialized applications.

Research and Development Activities
 
As a technology research and development company, much of our annual expenses are dedicated towards R&D, including labor costs, material costs, tooling and equipment and other expenses required to run our business. Our R&D expenditures for 2017 and 2016 were $238,682 and $604,199, respectively.
 
We actively pursue development agreements with customers, whereby we will develop an engine, design plans or other products to spec at the customer’s full or partial expense. Sometimes these arrangements are part of a more expansive license agreement.
 
Prototyping and Manufacturing
 
We currently contract with multiple suppliers for the production of many of our prototype parts, which we design and then assemble and test at our facility. In 2014, we acquired the machinery to produce in-house a greater portion of this prototype manufacturing work, which we believe has saved us considerable time and money. For production we have contracted with one or more manufacturers that have the expertise, machinery, tooling and other capital assets required to commercialize and manufacture in mass production our engines.
Competitive Business Conditions
 
We believe that our technology, which is a small-scale heat-regenerative, Rankine cycle external combustion engine, has little direct competition. However, depending on the industry in which these engines are applied, indirect competitors utilizing different technologies do exist.
 
Currently, there are several companies which have developed and commercialized other types of external heat engines, such as Stirling engines. Stirling engines are similar to our technology and are used in overlapping applications (such as solar thermal power generation), however; the two engine technologies have several major differences, including size, power-density, and adaptability to fluctuations in heat and load. Based on preliminary testing and analysis, we believe that our engine technology may be superior to the Stirling engines in these aspects; and thus, has more applications in waste heat and mobile uses (i.e., cars, trucks and ships). We have not yet commercialized our engine technology, and these claims are still to be proven. Also, several Stirling engine companies such as Infinia Corp. have greater capital resources than we do, which could help establish their technology in the marketplace quicker than we can. We feel starting in 2018 with the new capital investment we will catch up to these other technologies.
 
Other technologies that may be indirectly competitive with our engines are lithium-ion batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. Batteries are useful for some applications where limited sustained power (torque) and operating time is needed, however, they are just “fuel tanks” which allow for power that is generated elsewhere (i.e., a coal-fired power plant) to be saved and transported. The 100hp Cyclone engine we are currently developing, which would produce approximately 50kW of electric output, weighs just 125lbs, is 2 ft in diameter and height, and is expected to cost 10 times less to produce. Once again, these claims are based on our current beliefs and developmental testing, as we have not yet produced commercial products.
 
Patents and IP Protection
 
We currently have the following U.S. patents issued or allowed on our engine technology:
 

Active U.S. Patents | 
--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
U.S. No. 7,080,512 B2 | Heat Regenerative Engine 
U.S. No. 7,856,822 B2 | Heat Regenerative Engine

Pursuant to new US Patent Office regulations, upon approval and payment of back fees , the Company’s 8 expired patents can be reestablished from inception. We have also taken advantage of reissues to include changes and broaden the patents. We pursue a rigorous patent strategy, pursuant to which (and subject to our available cash resources) we file patents in the U.S. for our engines, their individual components, and other innovations and inventions we develop. We also pursue patents internationally in countries where we believe we may have manufacturing or sales opportunities and/or competition. Despite these efforts, we cannot make assurances that our patents will not infringe on other patents throughout the world, that other groups will not try to infringe on our patents, and if either of these were to occur, that we would have the resources to defend our rights. If this were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We require all customers, suppliers and other partners to execute Non-Disclosure Agreements. We also require our employees and certain contractors to sign agreements that assign to us any innovations or discoveries they develop while working for us or working with our technology. Our license agreements contain similar assignment provisions. We feel that these efforts are satisfactory in protecting our technology with respect to people and companies with which we have direct business relationships.
 
Sources and availability of raw material
 
We purchase raw materials and components from multiple sources, none of which may be considered a principal or material supplier. If necessary we could replace these suppliers with minimal effect on our business operations.
 
Dependence on customers 
 
We have contracts for development and licensing of our engine technology, our Thermal Storage Battery, and our Solar Trough: Combi-Lift LTD. (a global materials handling and lift equipment manufacturer based in Ireland), Falck Schmidt Defense Systems of Denmark (“FSDS”) which is in reorganization after a forced bankruptcy (a global military products manufacturing and supplier), IBES (a producer of biomass furnace electric systems) which is in breach of contract currently, Genesis, (a major construction builder with concrete technology) to build our Thermal Storage Units, a current list of four Distributors for sales of the generators being supplied through TAW Power Systems, and four integrators for Solar, off road vehicle, and two biomass fuel manufacturers. We have formed working relationships with other major industrial groups, and teaming agreements with manufacturers.
 
Because of the diversification of applications, uses and business models, and the current stage of our development /product sales cycle, we do not believe that the loss of the licensee or development partner would have a material adverse impact on our current or future operations. Additionally, we are actively pursuing other licensees and development partners in other product categories.
 
Governmental regulation
 
Our Products. Power systems are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise. Our engines, when they will ultimately be installed in power systems, will be subject to compliance with all current emissions standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies in the United States, including the California Air Resources Board (CARB), and other regulatory agencies around the world and established for power systems utilized in applications such as electric generators or off-highway industrial equipment. EPA and CARB regulations imposed on engines utilized in industrial off-highway equipment generally serve to restrict emissions, with a primary focus on oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and hydrocarbons. Emission regulations for engines utilized in off-highway industrial equipment vary based upon the use of the equipment into which the engine is incorporated (such as stationary power generation or mobile off-highway industrial equipment), and the type of fuel used to drive the power system. Further, applicable emission thresholds differ based upon the gross power of an engine utilized in industrial off-highway equipment. Additionally, most emissions thresholds are designed for gasoline and diesel-powered “spark-ignited” internal combustion engines, and not external combustion engines like Cyclone’s engines. In 2015, Cyclone received EPA and CARB certifications for all fuels 25HP and below for power generation.

Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters. We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets into which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities. Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our product or the interconnection of the product with the electric grid. Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site power generation, thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes. These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems in the future. This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability potential. In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our future operations. These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete. However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our distributed generation solutions as compared with competing technologies if we can achieve required compliance at a lower cost when our engines are commercialized. Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our future customers combat the effects of global warming. Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards. Cyclone has already received EPA and CARB emissions certification for generators any fuel 25 horsepower and under.
 
Our Operations. Our operations are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future, and any failure to comply with such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business.
 
Because of our work with the military, we have registered with the U.S. Department of State under its International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR). We do not believe we cannot develop, sell or export any covered munitions under these Regulations, but have registered the company in an abundance of precaution.
 
Employees. In 2017, we had 6 full-time employees including management, and two part-time employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees are covered under any labor union or collective bargaining agreement. As needed, we contract with specialized labor, machine shops / fabricators and consultants to control costs.
