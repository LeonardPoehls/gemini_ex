     Item 1.  Business
     Overview
     Sanchez Energy Corporation (together with our consolidated subsidiaries, “Sanchez Energy,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” or similar terms), a Delaware corporation formed in August 2011, is an independent exploration and production company focused on the acquisition and development of U.S. onshore unconventional oil and natural gas resources, with a current focus on the horizontal development of significant resource potential from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. We also hold an undeveloped acreage position in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale (“TMS”) in Mississippi and Louisiana, which offers potential future development opportunities. As of December 31, 2017, we had assembled approximately 487,000 gross leasehold acres (285,000 net acres) in the Eagle Ford Shale. In addition, we continually evaluate opportunities to grow our acreage and our producing assets through acquisitions. Our successful acquisition of such assets will depend on the opportunities and the financing alternatives available to us at the time we consider such opportunities. We have included definitions of some of the oil and natural gas terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K in the “Glossary of Selected Oil and Natural Gas Terms.”
     During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company changed from the full cost method to the successful efforts method in accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities. Financial information for prior periods has been recast to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method. For additional information, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” In addition, on February 14, 2018, we issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior secured first lien notes due 2023 (the “7.25% Senior Secured Notes”) and amended and restated our revolving credit facility to, among other things, (i) reduce its size from a $350 million borrowing base with a $300 million aggregate commitment amount to a $25 million commitment to provide primarily for working capital and letters of credit, (ii) extend the maturity from 2019 to 2023, (iii) remove all material financial maintenance covenants and (iv) provide for the continued ability to hedge. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 20. Subsequent Events”. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “prior revolving credit facility” refers to the Company’s revolving credit facility among the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, Royal Bank of Canada, as the administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, as in effect immediately prior to its amendment and restatement on February 14, 2018, and our “amended and restated credit facility” refers to our revolving credit facility as amended and restated on February 14, 2018.

Consideration received from the Javelina Disposition was based on an August 1, 2017 effective date and is subject to normal and customary post-closing adjustments.       Marquis Disposition
     On June 15, 2017, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SN Marquis LLC, sold approximately 21,000 net acres primarily located in the Eagle Ford Shale in Fayette and Lavaca Counties, Texas to Lonestar Resources US, Inc. (“Lonestar”) for approximately $44.0 million in cash, after preliminary closing adjustments, and approximately $6.0 million in Lonestar’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, valued as of the closing date, which subsequently converted into 1.5 million shares of Lonestar’s Class A Common Stock (the “Marquis Disposition”).  The consideration received from the Marquis Disposition was based on a January 1, 2017 effective date and is subject to normal and customary post-closing adjustments.       Comanche Acquisition
     On March 1, 2017, the Company, through two of its subsidiaries, SN EF UnSub, LP (“SN UnSub”) and SN EF Maverick, LLC (“SN Maverick”), along with Gavilan Resources, LLC (“Gavilan”), an entity controlled by The Blackstone Group, L.P. completed the acquisition of approximately 318,000 gross (155,000 net) acres comprised of 252,000 gross (122,000 net) Eagle Ford Shale acres and 66,000 gross (33,000 net) acres of deep rights only, which includes the Pearsall Shale, representing an approximate 49% average working interest therein (the “Comanche Assets”) from Anadarko E&P Onshore LLC and Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Onshore LP (together, “Anadarko”) for approximately $2.1 billion in cash (the “Comanche Acquisition”).  Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement entered into in connection with the Comanche Acquisition, (i) SN UnSub paid approximately 37% of the purchase price (including through a $100 million cash contribution from other Company entities) and (ii) SN Maverick paid approximately 13% of the purchase price.  In the aggregate, SN UnSub and SN Maverick acquired half of the 49% working interest in the Comanche Assets (approximately 50% and 0%, respectively, of the estimated total proved developed producing reserves (PDPs), 20% and 30%, respectively, of the estimated total proved developed non-producing reserves (PDNPs), and 20% and 30%, respectively, of the total proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs)) (“SN Comanche Assets”).  Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, Gavilan paid 50% of the purchase price and acquired the remaining half of the 49% working interest in and to the Comanche Assets (and approximately 50% of the estimated total PDPs, PDNPs and PUDs).  The Comanche Assets are primarily located in the Western Eagle Ford and are contiguous with our existing acreage, significantly expanding our asset base and production.  The effective date of the Comanche Acquisition was July 1, 2016, and is subject to normal and customary post-closing purchase price adjustments.     Cotulla Disposition
     On December 14, 2016, SN Cotulla Assets, LLC (“SN Cotulla”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, sold approximately 15,000 net acres located in Dimmit County, Frio County, LaSalle County, Zavala County and McMullen County, Texas (the “Cotulla Assets”) to Carrizo (Eagle Ford) LLC for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $153.5 million, subject to normal and customary post-closing adjustments (the “Cotulla Disposition”). Consideration received from the Cotulla Disposition was based on a June 1, 2016 effective date.
     During 2017, two additional closings occurred and final settlement adjustments were made to the purchase price, which resulted in total aggregate consideration of approximately $167.4 million.
     Carnero Processing Disposition
     On November 22, 2016, the Company, through SN Midstream, LLC (“SN Midstream”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, sold its membership interests in Carnero Processing, LLC (“Carnero Processing”). a joint

venture that is 50% owned by Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE: TRGP) (“Targa”), to SNMP for an initial payment of approximately $55.5 million and the assumption by SNMP of remaining capital commitments to Carnero Processing which were estimated on the transaction closing date to be approximately $24.5 million (the “Carnero Processing Disposition”). The Carnero Processing Disposition purchase price was determined through arm’s length negotiations between the Company and SNMP, including independent committees of both entities.
     Production Asset Transaction
     On November 22, 2016, the Company, through two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, SN Cotulla and SN Palmetto, LLC (“SN Palmetto”), completed the sale of certain non-core producing oil and gas assets, located in South Texas, to SNMP for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $24.2 million in cash (the “Production Asset Transaction”). The Production Asset Transaction included the disposition of working interests in 23 producing Eagle Ford wellbores located in Dimmit, LaSalle and Zavala counties in South Texas together with escalating working interests in an additional 11 producing wellbores located in the Palmetto Field in Gonzales County, Texas to SNMP. The effective date of the Production Asset Transaction was July 1, 2016. The purchase price was determined through arm’s length negotiations between the Company and SNMP, including independent committees of both entities.     Carnero Gathering Disposition
     On July 5, 2016, the Company, through SN Midstream, sold its membership interests in Carnero Gathering, LLC (“Carnero Gathering”), a joint venture that is 50% owned by Targa, to SNMP for a purchase price of approximately $37.0 million and the assumption by SNMP of remaining capital commitments to Carnero Gathering, which were estimated on the transaction closing date to be approximately $7.4 million (the “Carnero Gathering Disposition”).  In addition, SNMP is required to pay the Company a monthly “earnout” based on natural gas received at Carnero Gathering’s Raptor Gas Processing Facility receipt points from the Company and natural gas delivered and processed at the Raptor Gas Processing Facility by other producers. The purchase price was determined through arm’s length negotiations between the Company and SNMP, including independent committees of both entities.      Western Catarina Midstream Divestiture
     On October 14, 2015, the Company and SN Catarina, LLC (“SN Catarina”) completed the sale of SN Catarina’s interests in Catarina Midstream, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SN Catarina (“Catarina Midstream”), which as of the closing included certain midstream gathering lines and associated assets and interests located in Dimmit County and Webb County, Texas and 105,263 SNMP Common Units to SNMP for an adjusted purchase price of $345.8 million in cash (the “Western Catarina Midstream Divestiture”). In connection with the closing of the Western Catarina Midstream Divestiture, the Company entered into a Firm Gathering and Processing Agreement (the “Gathering Agreement”) on October 14, 2015 for an initial term of 15 years under which production from approximately 35,000 acres in Dimmit County and Webb County, Texas have been dedicated for gathering by Catarina Midstream. In addition, for the first five years of the Gathering Agreement, we are required to meet a minimum quarterly volume delivery commitment of 10,200 Bbl per day of crude oil and condensate and 142,000 Mcf per day of natural gas, subject to certain adjustments. We are required to pay gathering and processing fees of $0.96 per barrel for crude oil and condensate and $0.74 per Mcf for natural gas that are tendered through the gathering system, in each case, subject to an annual escalation for a positive increase in the consumer price index. In addition, we have, under certain circumstances, a right of first refusal during the term of the agreement and afterwards with respect to dispositions by Catarina Midstream of its ownership interest in the gathering system. The purchase price was determined through arm’s length negotiations between the Company and SNMP, including independent committees of both entities.

 Palmetto Disposition
     On March 31, 2015, the Company completed the disposition to a subsidiary of SNMP of escalating amounts of partial working interests in 59 wellbores located in Gonzales County, Texas for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $83.4 million (the “Palmetto Disposition”).  We received consideration consisting of approximately $81.4 million in cash, after purchase price adjustments, and 1,052,632 SNMP common units valued at approximately $2.0 million as of the date of the closing, which units were subsequently sold back to SNMP in connection with the Western Catarina Midstream Divestiture. The effective date of the Palmetto Disposition was January 1, 2015. The aggregate average working interest percentage initially conveyed was 18.25% per wellbore and, upon January 1 of each subsequent year after the closing, the working interest of the purchaser will automatically increase in incremental amounts according to the purchase agreement until January 1, 2019, at which point the purchaser will own a 47.5% working interest, and the Company will own a 2.5% working interest in each of the wellbores.      Catarina Acquisition
     On June 30, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of 106,000 net contiguous acres in Dimmit, LaSalle and Webb Counties, Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale from SWEPI LP and Shell Gulf of Mexico Inc. for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $557 million (the “Catarina Acquisition”).  The effective date of the Catarina Acquisition was January 1, 2014. All proved reserves in the Catarina area are covered under lease acreage that is held by production, which acreage amounted to approximately 29,000 acres at the time of closing. Under the lease we have a 100% working interest and 75% net revenue interest in the lease acreage over the Eagle Ford Shale formation from the top of the Austin Chalk formation to the base of the Buda Lime formation. The undeveloped acreage acquired in the Catarina Acquisition is subject to a continuous drilling obligation. Such drilling obligation requires us to drill (i) 50 wells in each annual period commencing on July 1, 2014 and (ii) at least one well in any consecutive 120‑day period in order to maintain rights to any future undeveloped acreage. Up to 30 wells drilled in excess of the minimum 50 wells in a given annual period can be carried over to satisfy part of the 50 well requirement in the subsequent annual period on a well for well basis. The lease also created a customary security interest in the production therefrom in order to secure royalty payments to the lessor and other lease obligations. Our current capital budget and plans include drilling at least the minimum annual well requirement necessary to maintain access to such undeveloped acreage.      Our Business Strategies
     Our primary business objective is to increase reserves, production and cash flows at an attractive return on invested capital. Our business strategy is currently focused on developing long‑life, unconventional oil, condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves from the Eagle Ford Shale as well as other projects that directly enhance the economics of our oil and natural gas operations. Key elements of our business strategy include:
· | Efficiently develop our Eagle Ford Shale leasehold positions. We intend to efficiently drill and develop our acreage position to maximize the value of our resource potential. At December 31, 2017, approximately 51% of our proved reserves were proved undeveloped. As of December 31, 2017, we had 831 net wells and had identified over 3,700 net locations in our Eagle Ford Shale area that comprise our primary development targets. In 2018, we plan to invest between $420 million and $470 million, nearly 90% of which is allocated to drilling and completion activity, with approximately 50% of the drilling completion budget allocated to our Catarina area, 45% allocated to our Comanche area, and 5% allocated to our Maverick area. The remaining 10% of our capital budget has been allocated to leasing, geological and geophysical activities, facilities and other capital expenditures.

· | Enhance returns by focusing on operational and cost efficiencies. We are focused on the continued improvement of our operating measures and have significant experience in successfully converting early‑stage resource opportunities into cost‑efficient development projects. We believe the magnitude and concentration of our acreage within our core project areas provide us with the opportunity to capture economies of scale, including the ability to directly procure goods and services from manufacturers, drill multiple wells from a single pad, utilize centralized production and fluid handling facilities and implement a line-management approach to improve efficiencies in drilling and completions. In addition, we focus on midstream and other projects that serve our production and add optionality to end markets, ultimately enhancing our realized prices.

· | Adopt and employ leading drilling and completion techniques. We are focused on enhancing our drilling and completion techniques to maximize recovery of reserves. Industry methods with respect to drilling and completion have significantly evolved over the last several years, resulting in increased initial production rates and recoverable hydrocarbons per well through the implementation of longer laterals, more tightly spaced fracture stimulation stages and larger proppant volumes. We evaluate industry drilling results and monitor the results of other operators to improve our operating practices, and we expect our drilling and completion techniques to continue to evolve. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage our relationship with our affiliates to expand unconventional assets. SOG, headquartered in Houston, Texas, is a privately owned full service oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration and development of oil and natural gas primarily in the South Texas, Louisiana and onshore Gulf Coast areas on behalf of certain of its affiliates, including the Company, pursuant to existing management services agreements. The Company refers to SOG and its affiliates (excluding Sanchez Energy), collectively, as the “Sanchez Group.” Various members of the Sanchez Group have drilled or participated in over 4,000 wells, directly and through joint ventures, and have invested substantial amounts of capital in the oil and natural gas industry since 1972. During this period, they have carefully cultivated relationships with mineral and surface rights owners in and around our core areas and compiled an extensive technological database that we believe gives us a competitive advantage in acquiring additional leasehold positions in these areas. We have unrestricted access to the proprietary portions of the technological database related to our properties and SOG is otherwise required to interpret and use the database for our benefit. We plan to leverage our affiliates’ expertise, industry relationships and size to opportunistically expand reserves and our leasehold positions in the Eagle Ford Shale and other onshore unconventional oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas resources. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursue strategic acquisitions to grow our leasehold position in the Eagle Ford Shale and seek opportunistic entry into new basins. We believe that we will be able to identify and acquire additional acreage and producing assets in the Eagle Ford Shale at attractive valuations by leveraging our longstanding relationships in and knowledge of South Texas. We may also selectively target additional domestic basins that would allow us to employ our strategies on attractive positions that we believe are similar to our Eagle Ford Shale acreage. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain substantial financial liquidity and flexibility. As of December 31, 2017, we had a liquidity position of approximately $588.9 million, consisting of approximately $184.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, $250 million of available borrowing capacity at the elected commitment amount under our prior revolving credit facility, and $154.5 million in available borrowing capacity at the elected commitment amount under our SN UnSub Credit Agreement (defined in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6. Debt”). On February 14, 2018, we issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.25% Senior Secured Notes and amended and restated our prior revolving credit facility. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 20. Subsequent Events.” We continually evaluate our level of operating activity in light of commodity prices, our cost structure and other considerations, and, based upon this evaluation, may adjust our capital spending as appropriate. In addition, we expect to continue to regularly review acquisition opportunities from third parties or other members of the Sanchez Group. We have entered into and intend to continue executing hedging transactions for a significant portion of our expected production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices.

      Our Competitive Strengths
     We believe the following competitive strengths will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies:
    
· | Geographically concentrated leasehold position in the Eagle Ford Shale. We have assembled a current leasehold position of approximately 285,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford Shale, which we believe to be one of the highest rate of return unconventional oil and natural gas formations in North America. Our geographically concentrated acreage position allows us to establish economies of scale with respect to drilling, production, operating and administrative costs, in addition to further leveraging our base of technical expertise in our project areas. We believe that our recent well results and offset operator activity

  7

 

in and around our project areas have significantly de‑risked our acreage position such that there are low geologic risks and ample repeatable drilling opportunities across our core operating areas.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Proven low cost operator. We are recognized as one of the lowest cost operators in the Eagle Ford Shale. We utilize a combination of initiatives that have improved the efficiency of our operations and reduced the cost of sourcing goods and services. The Company has implemented systems and processes that provide greater coordination across our organization, thereby minimizing inefficiencies from repetitive tasks. We have also segmented and optimized each step in drilling and completing our wells. In addition, our supply chain management team takes a rigorous and methodical approach to reducing the total delivered cost of purchased goods and services by examining costs on their most basic level. As a result, goods and services are commonly sourced directly from suppliers. Additionally, we constantly review the value chain for opportunities to internally provide services in order to further reduce, or provide sustainability in, current costs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Demonstrated ability to drive liquids production and reserves growth. Our average production for full year 2017 was approximately 70,320 Boe/d, substantially all of which was from the Eagle Ford Shale. This compares to approximately 53,358 Boe/d for the full year 2016. Our total proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were 362.7 MMBoe, an increase of approximately 88% over the prior year.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Large multi‑year oil-weighted drilling inventory. As of December 31, 2017, we had an inventory of over 3,700 net locations for potential future drilling on our acreage position in the oil, natural gas and condensate, or black oil and volatile oil and natural gas, windows of the Eagle Ford Shale. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Experienced management and strong technical team. Our team is comprised of individuals with a long history in the oil and natural gas business, and a number of our key executives have prior experience as members of public company management teams. Furthermore, members of the Sanchez Group have a 40-plus year operating history in the areas in which we operate, providing us with extensive knowledge of the basins and the ability to leverage longstanding relationships with mineral owners. Through SOG, we have access to an experienced staff of oil and natural gas professionals including geophysicists, geologists, drilling and completion engineers, production and reservoir engineers and technical support personnel. SOG’s technical team has significant experience and expertise in applying the most sophisticated technologies used in conventional and unconventional resource style plays including 3‑D seismic interpretation capabilities, horizontal drilling, comprehensive multi‑stage hydraulic fracture stimulation programs and other exploration, production and processing technologies. We believe this technical expertise is integral to successful development of our assets, including defining new core producing areas in emerging plays.

      Core Properties
     Eagle Ford Shale
     We and our predecessor entities have a long history in the Eagle Ford Shale, where, as of December 31, 2017, we have assembled approximately 487,000 gross leasehold acres (approximately 285,000 net acres) and have over 8,000 gross (3,700 net) specifically identified drilling locations for potential future drilling. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 748 of these drilling locations represented proved undeveloped reserves. These locations were developed using existing geologic and engineering data. The approximately 7,252 additional gross drilling locations are specifically identified non-proven locations that have been identified by our management team. Although these approximate 7,252 gross additional non-proven locations are determined using the same geologic and engineering methodology as those locations to which proved reserves are attributed, they fail to satisfy all criteria for proven reserves for reasons such as development timing, economic viability at Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pricing, and production volume certainty. In evaluating and determining those locations, we also considered the availability of local infrastructure, drilling support assets, property restrictions and state and local regulations. The locations on which we actually drill wells will ultimately depend upon the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, oil and natural gas prices, costs, actual drilling results and other factors, and may differ from the locations currently identified. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Our identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years,

making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.” For the year 2018, we plan to invest substantially all of our capital budget in the Eagle Ford Shale. 
     In 2017, we acquired approximately 252,000 gross (61,000 net) acres in Dimmit, Webb, La Salle, Zavala and Maverick Counties, Texas through the Comanche Acquisition representing a 24% working interest, which we refer to as the Comanche area.  We anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to average between $3.0 million and $6.0 million per well.  The variability in the cost is largely a factor of lateral lengths, which can vary from approximately 4,400 feet to approximately 11,100 feet.  We have identified greater than 5,300 gross (1,300 net) Eagle Ford locations for potential future drilling on our Comanche area. For the year 2018, we plan to spend $145 million to $150 million to spud 33 net wells and complete 19 net wells in our Comanche area. Additionally, we anticipate spending $40 million to $50 million to complete an additional 21 net drilled-but-uncompleted wells (“DUCs”).
     In the Comanche area, we have a drilling obligation that, in addition to other requirements in the leases that must be adhered to in order to maintain our acreage position, requires us to complete and equip 60 wells in each annual period commencing on September 1, 2017 and continuing thereafter until September 1, 2022.  Up to 30 wells completed and equipped in excess of the annual 60 well requirement can be carried over to satisfy part of the 60 well requirement in subsequent annual periods on a well-for-well basis.  As of December 31, 2017, 50 wells had been drilled towards the 60 well commitment that will end on August 31, 2018.  In addition, 129 DUCs acquired as part of the Comanche Acquisition had commenced completions operations, and 105 of those DUCs had been brought online.  These DUCs do not count toward the annual development obligation.  For the year 2018, our current capital budget and plans include the drilling of at least the minimum number of wells to maintain access to such undeveloped acreage in the Comanche area.
     We have approximately 106,000 net acres in Dimmit, LaSalle and Webb Counties, Texas representing a 100% working interest, which we refer to as the Catarina area. We anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $3.0 million and $6.0 million per well based on our current estimates and historical well costs. The variability in the cost is largely a factor of lateral lengths, which can vary from approximately 4,400 feet to approximately 11,000 feet. We have identified greater than 1,150 gross (1,150 net) locations for potential future drilling on our Catarina acreage. For the year 2018, we plan to spend $205 million to $215 million to spud 44 net wells and complete 44 net wells in our Catarina area.
     In the Catarina area, we have a drilling obligation that requires us to drill (i) 50 wells in each 12-month period commencing on July 1, 2014 and (ii) at least one well in any consecutive 120‑day period in order to maintain rights to any future undeveloped acreage.  Up to 30 wells drilled in excess of the minimum 50 wells in a given annual period can be carried over to satisfy part of the 50 well requirement in the subsequent 12-month period on a well for well basis.  By exceeding the 50 well annual drilling commitment in the two prior years by 20 wells and 18 wells, respectively, the Company maximized the allowable 30 well bank that can be applied towards the current annual drilling commitment period.  As of December 31, 2017, SN had drilled 10 wells in addition to the 30 wells banked towards the annual well commitment in the Catarina area that extends from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.
     We have approximately 110,000 net acres in Dimmit, Frio, LaSalle, and Zavala Counties, Texas, which we refer to as the Maverick area. We believe that our Maverick acreage lies in the black oil window, where we anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $5.5 million and $6.0 million per well based on our current estimates and historical well costs. The variability in the cost is largely a factor of lateral lengths, which can vary from approximately 9,500 feet to approximately 10,000 feet. We have identified greater than 1,050 gross (1,000 net) locations for potential future drilling on our Maverick area. For the year 2018, we plan to spend $15 million to $25 million to spud 3 net wells and complete 3 net wells in our Maverick area.
     We have approximately 7,600 net acres in Gonzales County, Texas, which we refer to as the Palmetto area. We believe that our Palmetto acreage lies in the volatile oil window where we anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $5.5 and $6.0 million per well based on our current estimates and historical well costs. We have identified greater than 440 gross (215 net) locations for potential future Eagle Ford drilling in our Palmetto area. For the year 2018, we plan to spend $2 million to spud 1 net well in our Palmetto area.

 Tuscaloosa Marine Shale
     As of December 31, 2017, we owned approximately 37,000 net acres in the TMS. The TMS development is currently challenged due to high well costs and depressed commodity prices. We believe that the TMS play has significant development potential as changes in technology, commodity prices, and service prices occur.      Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Production
     Internal Controls
     Our estimated reserves at December 31, 2017 were prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (“Ryder Scott”), our independent third-party reserve engineers pursuant to their report dated January 10, 2018, which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect to continue to have our reserve estimates prepared semi‑annually by Ryder Scott. Our internal professional staff works closely with Ryder Scott to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data that is furnished to them for their reserve estimation process. All of the reserve information maintained in our reserve engineering database is provided to the external engineers. In addition, we provide Ryder Scott other pertinent data, such as seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. We make all requested information, as well as our pertinent personnel, available to the external engineers as part of their evaluation of our reserves.      Technology Used to Establish Reserves
     Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
     To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, Ryder Scott employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations were estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques.
     Qualifications of Responsible Technical Persons
     Internal SOG Engineers. Daniel Furbee is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates. Mr. Furbee has over a decade of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering and evaluations with companies such as Baker Hughes and LINN Energy. He holds a Bachelor of Science Petroleum Engineering degree from Marietta College and a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Houston.

 (1)Our estimated net proved reserves and related standardized measure were determined using index prices for oil and natural gas, without giving effect to commodity derivative contracts, held constant throughout the life of our properties. The unweighted arithmetic average first‑day‑of‑the‑month prices for the prior twelve months were $51.34/Bbl for WTI Cushing oil, $31.82/Bbl for NGLs and $2.98/MMBtu for Henry Hub natural gas at December 31, 2017. These prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price realized at the wellhead. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the average realized prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas were $48.69 per Bbl, $20.52 per Bbl and $3.10 per Mcf, respectively. For a description of our commodity derivative contracts, please read “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—

Operating Costs and Expenses—Commodity Derivative Transactions” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Derivative Instruments.”
     (2)  One Boe is equal to six Mcf of natural gas or one Bbl of oil or NGLs based on an approximate energy equivalency. This is a physical correlation and does not reflect a value or price relationship between the commodities.
     (3)  PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Item 6. Selected Financial Data – Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure.
     (4)  Standardized measure is calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), Topic 932, Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas. For further information regarding the calculation of the standardized measure, see “Supplementary Information on Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Development and Production Activities (Unaudited)” included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

     The data in the table above represents estimates only. Oil, NGLs and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, NGLs and natural gas that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil, NGLs and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. For a discussion of risks associated with reserve estimates, please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our estimated reserves and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our estimated reserves.”
     Future prices realized for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The standardized measure amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate standardized measure, which is required by Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) pronouncements, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
     Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
     None of our proved undeveloped reserves (“PUD”) at December 31, 2017 are scheduled to be developed on a date more than five years from the date the reserves were initially booked as proved undeveloped. Historically, our drilling and development programs were substantially funded from capital contributions, cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and equity securities. Based on our current expectations of our cash flows and drilling and development programs, which includes drilling of proved undeveloped locations, we believe that we can fund the drilling of our current inventory of proved undeveloped locations and our expansions and extensions in the next five years from our cash on hand combined with cash flow from operations and utilization of available borrowing capacity under our amended and restated credit facility.
     At a pace of approximately 30 wells per rig per year, our current 748 PUD drilling locations will all be developed within the next five years by running an average gross rig count of five rigs. As of December 31, 2017, we were running six active rigs and have an approved annual budget that allows for approximately six rigs to be run through 2018. For a more detailed discussion of our liquidity position, please read “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

      Excluding acquisitions, we expect to make capital expenditures related to drilling and completion of wells of approximately $420 million to $470 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. We plan to spend approximately 25% to 28% of these capital expenditures on development of PUDs in 2018. Technical revisions of PUD estimates are the result of changes in forecasted performance. Purchases are related to the 318,000 gross acres acquired as part of the Comanche Acquisition.

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      As of December 31, 2017, approximately 76% of our acreage was held by production and/or continuous operations. As of December 31, 2017, we have leases that were not held by production and/or continuous operations representing approximately 15.1 thousand net acres (all of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2018, 7.9 thousand net acres (7.2 thousand of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2019, and 58.3 thousand net acres (46.5 thousand of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2020 and beyond. We anticipate that our current and future drilling plans along with selected lease extensions will address the majority of our leases expiring in the Eagle Ford Shale in 2018 and beyond. We have a continuous development obligation in our Catarina area that requires us to drill, but not complete, (i) 50 wells in each annual period commencing on July 1, 2014 and (ii) at least one well in any consecutive 120 day period in order to maintain rights to any future undeveloped acreage. In addition to these lease expirations, we also have a continuous drilling obligation in our Comanche area, in addition to other requirements in the leases that must be adhered to in order to maintain our acreage position, that requires us to complete and equip 60 wells in each annual period that commenced on September 1, 2017.
     Delivery Commitments
     As is common in our industry, we have made commitments to certain purchasers to deliver a portion of our production from our Catarina area and our Comanche area.      Catarina Area
     As of December 31, 2017, in our Catarina area, we have three contracts that require us to deliver portions of our natural gas, with delivery requirements through 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Under the Gathering Agreement expiring in 2020, we are required to deliver 118 Bcf of natural gas through the Catarina Midstream gathering facilities. Under our contract expiring in 2021, we are required to deliver approximately 63 Bcf of natural gas. Under our contract expiring in 2022, we are required to deliver approximately 201 Bcf of natural gas. During 2017, we recorded expenses related to deficiencies on delivery commitments of approximately $0.2 million. These amounts were recorded to the “Oil and natural gas production expenses” line item in our consolidated statement of operations and were not considered material to the financial statement line item or to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. We expect to have additional expenses in 2018 related to deficiencies on our natural gas delivery commitments.
    
 
  17

 

 The Gathering Agreement also requires us to deliver a portion of our oil production through the Catarina Midstream gathering facilities. Under this contract, which expires in 2020, we are required to deliver approximately 8 MMBbls of oil. We do not expect to have additional expenses in 2018 related to deficiencies on our oil delivery commitments.
     Comanche Area
     We, as the operator, on behalf of ourselves and the other working interest partners, are party to two gathering agreements that require us to deliver variable monthly quantities through 2034.  Gross volumes under these contracts peak at approximately 63,000 Bbl per day (approximately 14,800 Bbl per day net) of crude oil and condensate in 2020 and 430,000 Mcf per day (approximately 101,400 Mcf per day net) of natural gas in 2022, and then decrease annually thereafter through the end of the contracts.  We are currently meeting our minimum volume commitments under these contracts and expect to continue to fulfill these obligations based on the applicable anticipated development plan. We do not expect to have additional expenses in 2018 related to deficiencies on these commitments.
     We, as the operator, on behalf of ourselves and the other working interest partners, are party to three contracts that require us to deliver portions of our natural gas, with delivery requirements through 2021, 2023, and 2033, respectively. Under the contract expiring in 2021, we are required to deliver approximately 24 Bcf of natural gas. Under the contract expiring in 2023, we are required to deliver approximately 147 Bcf of natural gas. Under the contract expiring in 2033, we are required to deliver approximately 287 Bcf of natural gas.  During 2017, we recorded expenses related to deficiencies on delivery commitments of approximately $1.8 million. We expect to have additional expenses in 2018 related to deficiencies on our natural gas delivery commitments.
     We, as the operator, on behalf of ourselves and the other working interest partners, are party to one contract that require us to deliver portions of our NGLs. This contract expires in 2023 and requires us to deliver approximately 15 MMBbls of NGLs. During 2017, we recorded expenses related to deficiencies on delivery commitments of approximately $0.1 million. We do not expect to have additional expenses in 2018 related to deficiencies on our natural gas delivery commitments.
     We, as the operator, on behalf of ourselves and the other working interest partners, are party to one contract that require us to deliver portions of our oil. This contract expires in 2020 and requires us to deliver approximately 5 MMBbls of oil. During 2017, we recorded expenses related to deficiencies on delivery commitments of approximately $2.7 million. We expect to have additional expenses in 2018 related to deficiencies on our oil delivery commitments.
     Operations
     Oil and Natural Gas Leases
     The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any well drilled on the lease premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our Eagle Ford properties range from 16.7% to 27.2%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us ranging from 72.8% to 83.3%.     Marketing and Major Customers
     For the year ended December 31, 2017, purchases by four of our customers accounted for more than 10% (19%, 14%, 26%, and 23%, respectively) of our total revenues. The four customers, who are not affiliates of the Company, purchased oil, natural gas and NGLs from us pursuant to existing marketing agreements with terms that are currently on “evergreen” status and renew on a month‑to‑month basis until either party gives 30‑day advance written notice of non‑renewal.
     Since the oil, natural gas and NGLs that we sell are commodities for which there are a large number of potential buyers and because of the adequacy of the infrastructure to transport these products in the areas in which we operate, if we were to lose one or more customers, we believe that we could readily procure substitute or additional customers such that our production volumes would not be materially affected for any significant period of time.

 Hedging Activities
     We enter into commodity derivative contracts with unaffiliated third parties to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short‑term fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. For a more detailed discussion of our hedging activities, please read “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Operating Costs and Expenses—Commodity Derivative Transactions,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Derivative Instruments” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”     Competition
     We operate in a highly competitive environment for leasing and acquiring properties and in securing trained personnel. Our competitors specifically include major and independent oil and natural gas companies that operate in our project areas. These competitors include, but are not limited to, Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc., Chesapeake Energy Corporation, EOG Resources, Inc., Marathon Oil Corporation, SM Energy Company and Noble Energy, Inc. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects, as well as evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to find and develop reserves will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry.
     We are also affected by the competition for and the availability of equipment, including drilling rigs, completion equipment and materials. We are unable to predict when, or if, shortages of such equipment may occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation programs.
     Title to Properties
     Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas properties, we perform title reviews on significant leases, and depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, title examinations have been obtained on a significant portion of our properties. After an acquisition, we review the assignments from the seller for scrivener’s and other errors and execute and record corrective assignments as necessary.
     As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the titles to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property.
     We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient rights‑of‑way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business in all material respects as described in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.

 Seasonal Nature of Business
     Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months, resulting in seasonal fluctuations in the price we receive for our natural gas production. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.     Environmental Matters and Regulation
     General
     Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and the Texas Railroad Commission (“Commission”), issue regulations, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities; (iii) govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process; (iv) limit or prohibit drilling or injection activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, seismically active areas, and other protected areas; (v) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; (vi) result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations; (vii) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations; and (viii) require that additional pollution controls be installed. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations. Furthermore, liability under such laws and regulations is often strict (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) and can be joint and several. 
     These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, the U.S. Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs. 
     The historic trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect us, there is no assurance that this situation will continue in the future. 
     The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.

 Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling
     Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict and, in some cases, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons considered to be responsible for the release, deemed “responsible parties,” of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, past owners or operators at the time a hazardous substance was released at the site, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons are subject to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file common law-based claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances, and despite the “petroleum exclusion” of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. In addition, we may have liability for releases of hazardous substances at our properties by prior owners or operators or other third parties. 
     The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes and their implementing regulations, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Federal and state regulatory agencies can seek to impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for alleged non-compliance with RCRA and analogous state requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA's less stringent solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. It is possible, however, that certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in the U.S. Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes.” Also, in December 2016, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to review its regulations of oil and gas waste.  It has until March 2019 to determine whether any revisions are necessary. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 
     We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration, production and processing for many years. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the requirements of CERCLA, RCRA, and related state and local laws and regulations, that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations required under such laws and regulations and that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed 

 
  21

 
substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.
     Water and Other Water Discharges and Spills
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, or the SDWA, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or the OPA, and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including oil, produced waters and other hazardous substances, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by EPA or an analogous state agency. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”). On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the Corps jointly promulgated final rules redefining the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. To the extent the rule expands the range of properties subject to the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. Following its promulgation, numerous states and industry groups challenged the rule and on October 9, 2015, a federal court stayed the rule’s implementation nationwide, pending further action in court. In response to this decision, the EPA and the Corps have resumed nationwide use of the agencies’ prior regulations defining the term “waters of the United States.” Further, on February 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the relevant executive agencies to review the rules and to initiate rulemaking to rescind or revise them, as appropriate under the stated policies of protecting navigable waters from pollution while promoting economic growth, reducing uncertainty, and showing due regard for Congress and the states. On July 27, 2017, the EPA and the Corps published a proposed rule to rescind the 2015 rules and, on February 6, 2018, the agencies published a final rule to maintain the status quo pending the agencies review of the 2015 rules. Further legal challenges are expected.
 The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. The underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. 
     Furthermore, the EPA is examining regulatory requirements for “indirect dischargers” of wastewater – i.e., those that send their discharges to private or publicly owned treatment facilities, which treat the wastewater before discharging it to regulated waters. On June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities.
 Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Obtaining permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development, and require us to incur compliance costs. 
 The OPA amends the Clean Water Act and establishes strict liability and natural resource damages liability for unauthorized discharges of oil into waters of the United States. The OPA is the primary federal law imposing oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs.  The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. 

 
  22

 

 Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and the underground injection of fluids and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.  We maintain all required discharge permits necessary to conduct our operations, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with their terms. 
     Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing
     Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common process used by oil and natural gas exploration and
 production operators in the completion of certain oil and natural gas wells whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas. The SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, Program.  Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC Program, and thus the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. The EPA, however, has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the UIC Program. On February 12, 2014, the EPA published a revised UIC Program guidance for oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel fuel. The guidance document describes how regulations of Class II wells, which are those wells injecting fluids associated with oil and natural gas production activities, may be tailored to address the purported unique risks of diesel fuel injection during the hydraulic fracturing process. Although the EPA is not the permitting authority for UIC Class II programs in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, where we maintain acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider use of the above-mentioned guidance.  In addition, the EPA previously announced its plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by June 2018, which would describe a proposed mechanism - regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both - to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures.  Furthermore, legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in recent sessions of the U.S. Congress.
     The protection of groundwater quality is extremely important to us. We believe that we follow all state and federal regulations and apply industry standard practices for groundwater protection in our operations. These measures are subject to close supervision by state and federal regulators. Our policy and practice is to follow all applicable guidelines and regulations in the areas where we conduct hydraulic fracturing. Accordingly, we set surface casing strings below the deepest usable quality fresh water zones and cement them back to the surface in accordance with applicable regulations, potential lease requirements and other legal requirements to ensure protection of existing fresh water zones. Also, prior to commencing drilling operations for the production portion of the hole, the surface casing strings are pressure tested to ensure mechanical integrity.
     Although not presently relevant to our current 2017 development plans, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. On June 21, 2016, the United States District Court for Wyoming set aside the rule, holding that the BLM lacked Congressional authority to promulgate the rule. The BLM has appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the rule and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise it. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule. This decision has been challenged by state and environmental groups. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the rule will be implemented.
 Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, on December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water resources finding that, under some 

 
  23

 
circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing.
 These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing or the disposal of produced water and flowback fluid in underground injection wells under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanism. 
 Also, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, in December 2011, the Commission adopted rules and regulations requiring that oil and gas operators publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Also, in May 2013, the Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The new rules took effect in January 2014. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the Commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, amongst other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the Commission's authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The Commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal sites. 
     A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country alleging that hydraulic fracturing practices have induced seismic activity and adversely impacted drinking water supplies, use of surface water, and the environment generally. Several states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances.  These or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing or the disposal of produced water and flowback fluid in underground injection wells could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from conventional and tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings. 
 Further federal, state and/or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if additional federal or state and/or local laws are enacted. 
     Air Emissions
     The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) programs. The rules include NSPS for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells and establish specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The final rules seek to achieve a 95% reduction in Volatile Organic Compounds (“VOCs”) emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or "green completions" on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured 

 
  24

 
after January 1, 2015. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration. In particular, on May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, President Trump directed the EPA to review the 2016 regulations and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. On June 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements of the 2016 regulations, including fugitive emission requirements. 
     Also, on November 15, 2016, the BLM finalized a rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires operators to use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. The rule also clarifies when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas.  State and industry groups have challenged this rule in federal court, asserting that the BLM lacks authority to prescribe air quality regulations. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the above rule and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise it. Accordingly, on December 8, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to suspend or delay certain requirements of the 2016 methane rule until January 17, 2019. Further legal challenges are expected. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the rule will be implemented.
 These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects, and our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. While we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
     Climate Change
     In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHGs. The EPA has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emission control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions. Almost one-half of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs.
     Furthermore, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016 and establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions.  However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement and begin negotiations to either re-enter or negotiate an entirely new agreement with more favorable terms for the United States. The Paris Agreement sets forth a specific exit process, whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date, with such withdrawal taking effect one year from such notice. It is not clear what steps the Trump Administration plans to take to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, whether a new agreement can be negotiated, or what terms would be included in such an agreement. Furthermore, in response to the announcement, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord. 
 Restrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations, 

 
  25

 
could require us to incur increased operating costs to monitor and report on GHG emissions or reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages, or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.
 Moreover, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.
     National Environmental Policy Act
     Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment to evaluate the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Currently, we have minimal exploration and production activities on federal lands. However, to the extent our current or future activities on federal lands are subject to the requirements of NEPA, this process has the potential to delay the receipt of governmental permits and the development of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects.     Endangered Species Act
     The Federal Endangered Species Act, or the ESA, and analogous state statutes restrict activities that may adversely threatened or endangered species or their habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, though, in December 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service provided guidance limiting the reach of the Act. Federal agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitat. While some of our facilities on federal lands may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may identify, however, previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species, which could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.

 Occupational Safety and Health Act
     We are also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA's hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements.     Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
 The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Additionally, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the oil and natural gas industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.      Drilling and Production
     Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:
· | the location of wells;
--+-----------------------


· | the method of drilling and casing wells;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | the disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and
--+------------------------------------------


· | notice to surface owners and other third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------

      State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction.

 Natural Gas Regulation
 The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC's regulations for interstate natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas. 
 The FERC also possesses regulatory oversight over natural gas markets, including the purchase, sale and transportation activities of non-interstate pipelines and other natural gas market participants. FERC possesses substantial enforcement authority for violations of the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), including the ability to assess civil penalties, order disgorgement of profits and recommend criminal penalties. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the NGA to grant FERC new authority to facilitate price transparency in markets for the sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce, and to prohibit market manipulation. FERC's anti-manipulation regulations apply to FERC jurisdictional activities, which have been broadly construed by the FERC. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including civil penalties of up to $1.0 million per day, per violation. 
 In 2008, FERC took additional steps to enhance its market oversight and monitoring of the natural gas industry. Order No. 704, as clarified in orders on rehearing, requires buyers and sellers of natural gas above a de minimis level, including entities not otherwise subject to FERC jurisdiction, to submit an annual report to FERC describing their wholesale physical natural gas transactions that use an index or that contribute to or may contribute to the formation of a gas index. The FERC also contemplated expanding the industry's reporting requirements. On November 15, 2012, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking comments whether requiring quarterly reporting of every gas transaction within the FERC's jurisdiction that entails physical delivery for the next day or the next month would provide useful information for improving natural gas market transparency.  The FERC ultimately determined that imposing a quarterly reporting requirement is not necessary at this time and exercised its discretion to terminate the Notice of Inquiry on November 17, 2015. 
 Although natural gas prices are currently unregulated, the U.S. Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by the U.S. Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of our properties. Sales of condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. 
     State Regulation
     The various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. For example, Texas currently imposes a 4.6% severance tax on oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on natural gas production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production from natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill.
     The oil and natural gas industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
