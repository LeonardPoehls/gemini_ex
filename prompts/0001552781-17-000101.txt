Item 1. Business.
GENERAL OVERVIEW
 HCSB Financial Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated on June 10, 1999 to become a holding company for Horry County State Bank (the “Bank”). The Bank is a state chartered bank which commenced operations on January 4, 1988. Our primary market includes Horry and Georgetown Counties in South Carolina and Columbus and Brunswick Counties in North Carolina. From our 8 branch locations, we offer a full range of deposit services, including checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and IRAs. In addition, we offer a variety of loan products designed for consumers, businesses and farmers. As of December 31, 2016, we had total assets of $375.9 million, net loans of $211.4 million, deposits of $313.3 million and shareholders’ equity of $35.3 million. In 2016, the Company sold approximately 374 million shares of its common stock and approximately 905 thousand shares of its Series A preferred stock (as defined below) which allowed for the redemption of all of its outstanding subordinated promissory notes and junior subordinated debentures. The Company also redeemed in full its Series T preferred stock (as defined below) which was held by the U.S. Department of Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”).
Recent Developments
 Termination of the Consent Order
 
As a result of the Great Recession, the Bank entered into a Consent Order (the “Consent Order”) with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) and the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions (the “State Board”) on February 10, 2011, which, among other things, required the Bank to achieve and maintain total risk based capital at least equal to 10% of risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital at least equal to 8% of total assets and to seek to sell or merge the Bank if it cannot satisfy or maintain the requisite capital. October 26, 2016, the Bank received notification from the FDIC and the State Board that the Consent Order had been terminated. The Consent Order was replaced with certain regulatory requirements and restrictions, including a requirement to continue to improve credit quality and earnings, a restriction prohibiting dividend payments without prior approval from the supervisory authorities, and a requirement to maintain Tier 1 capital at least equal to 8% and total risk-based capital at least equal to 10%. We believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with the new regulatory requirements and restrictions.
Private and Public Offerings
 
On April 11, 2016, the Company completed a private placement of 359,468,443 shares of common stock at $0.10 per share and 905,316 shares of a new series of convertible perpetual preferred stock, Series A (the “Series A preferred stock”), at $10.00 per share for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $45.0 million (the “2016 private placement”). Net proceeds from the 2016 private placement, after deducting commissions and expenses, were approximately $41.5 million, of which $38.0 million was contributed to the Bank as a capital contribution to support its operations and increase its capital ratios to meet the then higher minimum capital ratios required under the terms of the terminated Consent Order. Net proceeds from the 2016 private placement were also used to repurchase the Company’s outstanding Series T preferred stock (as defined below), trust preferred securities, and subordinated promissory notes, as described below.
 
On June 30, 2016, the Company completed a public offering of 14,167,600 shares of common stock at $0.10 per share for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $1.4 million (the “2016 follow-on offering”). The 2016 follow-on offering was conducted primarily to provide the Company’s legacy shareholders, employees and others in its community with an opportunity to invest in the Company at the same offering price of $0.10 per share that the Company offered to the investors in the 2016 private placement. The proceeds from the 2016 follow-on offering were used for general corporate and operational purposes.

Changes to our Management Team and Board of Directors
 
As previously disclosed, effective as of the closing of the 2016 private placement, the boards of directors of the Company and the Bank appointed Jan H. Hollar as the chief executive officer and a director of the Company and the Bank. Ms. Hollar brings extensive banking expertise to the Company and the Bank from her 38 years of experience in the financial services industry, having most recently served as executive vice president and chief financial officer of Yadkin Financial Corporation and Yadkin Bank (together, “Yadkin”) in Statesville, North Carolina from September 2009 until July 2014. Ms. Hollar had been hired by Yadkin in 2009 as part of the executive management team that was brought in to address the challenges facing Yadkin as a result of the Great Recession. Yadkin’s management team engineered a significant turn-around in Yadkin’s operations and executed a number of key strategic measures to position the company and the bank for future growth. Other key management changes in 2016 were that:
 

· | W. Jack McElveen, Jr. was appointed as executive vice president and chief credit officer of the Bank; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | J. Rick Patterson was appointed as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Bank; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Jennifer W. Harris was appointed as senior vice president and chief financial officer of the Company and the Bank. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Also in connection with the 2016 private placement, Castle Creek Capital Partners VI, L.P. (“Castle Creek”), RMB Capital Management, LLC (“RMB”), EJF Sidecar Fund, Series LLC – Series E (“EJF”) and Strategic Value Investors, LP (“SVI”) entered into side letter agreements with the Company, pursuant to which (i) each of Castle Creek and RMB is entitled to have one representative appointed to the Company’s board of directors, and (ii) each of EJF and SVI is entitled to have one representative attend all meetings of the Company’s board of directors as a nonvoting observer, in each case for so long as these entities, together with its respective affiliates, owns, in the aggregate, 5% or more of all of the outstanding shares of our common stock (or, with respect to Castle Creek and RMB, 50% or more of their respective purchased shares). Following the receipt of regulatory approval, on May 26, 2016, the Company’s and Bank’s boards of directors appointed John T. Pietrzak, the appointed representative of Castle Creek, as a member of the respective boards of directors effective immediately. In addition, the Company’s board of directors nominated James C. Nesbitt, the appointed representative of RMB, as a member of the board of directors effective subject to the receipt of regulatory and shareholder approval. Messrs. Pietrzak and Nesbitt were elected to the Company’s board of directors by the Company’s shareholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, following receipt of regulatory approval for Mr. Nesbitt. Mr. Nesbitt was also appointed to the board of directors of the Bank on July 28, 2016, following receipt of regulatory approval.
 
Repurchase of Outstanding Series T Preferred Stock 
 
On April 11, 2016, immediately following the closing of the 2016 private placement, the Company repurchased all 12,895 shares of its outstanding fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series T (the “Series T preferred stock”), from the U.S. Treasury for $129 thousand and the U.S. Treasury canceled its outstanding warrant to purchase 91,714 shares of the Company’s common stock at $21.09 per share. The Series T preferred stock and the warrant were initially issued to the U.S. Treasury in March 2009 as part of the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program. The redemption gain realized was approximately $13.8 million. Refer to Note 15 to our Financial Statements for additional information on the Series T preferred stock.
Repurchase of Outstanding Trust Preferred Securities
 
On April 11, 2016, immediately following the closing of the 2016 private placement, the Company repurchased all of its outstanding floating rate trust preferred securities from Alesco Preferred Funding VI LTD (“Alesco”) for $600 thousand, plus reimbursement of approximately $17 thousand in third party legal expenses. The redemption gain realized on this settlement was approximately $6.3 million.

Approval of Class Action Settlement Agreement with Subordinated Debt Holders and Redemption of Subordinated Debt 
 
On March 2, 2016, the Court of Common Pleas for the Fifteenth Judicial District, State of South Carolina, County of Horry entered a final order of approval approving the class action settlement agreement between the Company, the Bank, James R. Clarkson, Glenn Raymond Bullard, Ron Lee Paige, Sr., and Edward Lewis Loehr, Jr., the President and Chief Executive Officer, former Senior Executive Vice President, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and the Bank, respectively, and Jan W. Snyder, Acey H. Livingston, and Mark Josephs, on behalf of themselves and as representatives of a class of similarly situated purchasers of the Company’s subordinated debt notes. The plaintiffs had previously filed a class action lawsuit seeking an unspecified amount of damages resulting from alleged wrongful conduct associated with purchases of the Company’s subordinated debt notes, including fraud, violation of state securities statutes, and negligence.
 
On April 11, 2016, immediately following the closing of the 2016 private placement, the Company established a settlement fund of approximately $2.4 million, which represented 20% of the principal of subordinated promissory notes issued by the Company. The proceeds of the fund were used to redeem the subordinated promissory notes held by class members. Also on April 11, 2016, the Company settled, pursuant to previously executed binding settlement agreements, with the subordinated promissory note holders who opted out of the class action settlement. These settlements, including the class action settlement, constituted the full satisfaction of the principal and interest owed on, and required the immediate dismissal of all pending litigation related to, the respective subordinated promissory notes. In each case, the Company and the Bank also obtained a full and complete release of all claims asserted or that could have been asserted with respect to the subordinated promissory notes. The redemption gain realized on this settlement was approximately $12.8 million.
 
Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock
 
On August 23, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to authorize a class of 150,000,000 shares of non-voting common stock. Also on August 23, 2016, the Company converted 905,316 shares of issued and outstanding Series A preferred stock into 90,531,557 shares of non-voting common stock. The 905,316 shares of Series A preferred stock converted into 90,531,557 shares of non-voting common stock represented all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock on such date and, as a result, all shares of the Series A preferred stock are no longer outstanding and resumed the status of authorized and unissued shares of the Company’s preferred stock.
Regulatory Matters 
 
Consent Order. As noted above, on October 26, 2016, the Consent Order was terminated by the FDIC and the State Board and was replaced with certain regulatory requirements and restrictions, including a requirement to continue to improve credit quality and earnings, a restriction prohibiting dividend payments without prior approval from the supervisory authorities, and a requirement to maintain Tier 1 capital at least equal to 8% and total risk-based capital at least equal to 10%. We believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with the new regulatory requirements and restrictions.
 
Written Agreement. On May 9, 2011, the Company entered into a Written Agreement (the “Written Agreement”) with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The Written Agreement is designed to enhance the Company’s ability to act as a source of strength to the Bank and contains provisions similar to those in the Consent Order. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with the Written Agreement. See Note 2 to our Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for more discussion of the Written Agreement.
 
Our Strategic Plan 
 As a response to the Great Recession and the terms of the Consent Order (which was terminated on October 26, 2016) and the Written Agreement, we adopted a new strategic plan, which included searching for additional capital or a potential merger partner, as well as taking steps to stabilize the Bank’s financial condition, including steps to reduce expenses, decrease the size of the Bank, and improve asset quality. The Company successfully closed the 2016 private placement and repurchased the outstanding Series T preferred stock and redeemed its trust preferred securities and its subordinated promissory notes.

In an effort to reduce nonperforming assets and overall risk in the portfolio, the Company also sold $4.3 million of non-performing loans and $270 thousand of other real estate owned (“OREO”) through a bulk sale in 2016. While the non-performing loans had been written down to fair value prior to the sale, a loss of $224 thousand was recognized. Total proceeds from the sale of OREO properties during 2016 were $6.0 million. As a result of these efforts, at December 31, 2016 total assets were $379.5 million, nonperforming assets had been reduced to $4.9 million compared to $22.4 million at December 31, 2015, and the Company had net income of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a loss of $246 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
Following the closing of the 2016 private placement transaction, we have particularly focused on positioning the Bank to return to profitability in the post-capital raise and post-recession environment. We have specifically focused on organic growth opportunities in the Myrtle Beach area given the market disruption in this geographic market area. Three of our eight branches are located along the Atlantic coastline in the Myrtle Beach market area, and as of June 30, 2016, the most recent date for which FDIC deposit market share data is available, total deposits in Horry County were approximately $5.7 billion, an increase of approximately 6.1% from $5.4 billion as of June 30, 2015. At June 30, 2016, the Bank’s deposits represented 5.7% of the market, a decrease from 7.1% at June 30, 2015.
 
We believe that raising capital in 2016, combined with our focus on improving credit quality, reducing problem assets, earnings improvements and garnering increased market share due to the market disruption in our markets, were the significant factors contributing to our return to quarterly profitability during the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result, we believe our earnings will be more stable and predictable going forward. However, as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our performance is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and we can provide no assurances regarding the sustainability of or improvement in future earnings.
 
Banking Services 
 
We offer a full range of deposit services that are typically available in most banks and savings and loan associations, including, checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, and time deposits of various types, ranging from daily money market accounts to longer-term certificates of deposit. The transaction accounts and time certificates are tailored to our principal market area at rates competitive to those offered in our market area. In addition, we offer certain retirement account services, such as Individual Retirement Accounts. All deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount allowed by law (generally, $250,000 per depositor, subject to aggregation rules). We solicit these accounts from individuals, businesses, associations and organizations, and governmental authorities.
Lending Activities 
 Presented below are our general lending activities. While under the Consent Order, the Bank had strictly limited any new lending, particularly with respect to commercial real estate loans. However, following the closing of the 2016 private placement and termination of the Consent Order, we have resumed our lending efforts while maintaining a conservative approach.
 General. We emphasize a range of lending services, including real estate, commercial, agricultural and consumer loans, to individuals and small to medium-sized businesses and professional concerns that are located in or conduct a substantial portion of their business in our market area. The characteristics of our loan portfolio and our underwriting procedures, collateral types, risks, approval process and lending limits are discussed below.
 Real Estate Loans. The primary component of our loan portfolio is loans collateralized by real estate, which made up approximately 82.0% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. Residential real estate loans were 33.2% of the portfolio. These loans are secured generally by first or second mortgages on residential, agricultural or commercial property and consist of commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans (but exclude home equity loans, which are classified as consumer loans).
 Due to concerns regarding the economic recession and our concentration of commercial real estate loans, we focused on reducing the level of these types of loans in our portfolio over the last several years. Following the closing of the 2016 private placement and termination of the Consent Order, we now maintain a conservative lending strategy toward these types of loans. Commercial real estate loans totaled $104.9 million, or 48.8% of the portfolio, at December 31, 2016, $23.0 million of which were construction and development type loans. Construction and development loans are secured by the real estate for which construction is planned.

Commercial Loans. At December 31, 2016, approximately 15.7% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans not including agricultural loans. Commercial loans consist of secured and unsecured loans, lines of credit, and working capital loans. We make these loans to various types of businesses. Included in this category are loans to purchase equipment, finance accounts receivable or inventory, and loans made for working capital purposes.
 Consumer Loans. Consumer loans made up approximately 2.3% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. These are loans made to individuals for personal and household purposes, such as secured and unsecured installment and term loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, and revolving lines of credit such as overdraft protection. Automobiles, recreational boats and small recreational vehicles are often pledged as collateral on secured consumer loans.
 Agricultural Loans. Approximately 2.6% of our loan portfolio consisted of agricultural loans at December 31, 2016. These are loans made to individuals and businesses for agricultural purposes, including loans to finance crop production and livestock operating expenses, to purchase farm equipment, and to store crops. These loans are secured generally by liens on growing crops and farm equipment. Also included in this category are loans to agri-businesses, which are substantially similar to commercial loans, as discussed above.
 Underwriting Procedures, Collateral, and Risk. Although we generally restricted new lending over the past few years while we focused on restoring the Bank’s financial condition following the closing of the 2016 private placement and termination of the Consent Order, we have resumed our lending efforts while remaining attentive to disciplined underwriting practices and prudent credit risk management.
 We use our established credit policies and procedures when underwriting each type of loan. Although there are minor variances in the characteristics and criteria for each loan type, which may require additional underwriting procedures, we generally evaluate borrowers using the following defined criteria:
 
· | Capacity – we evaluate the borrower’s ability to service the debt. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capital – we evaluate the borrower’s overall financial strength, as well as the equity investment in the asset being financed. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Collateral – we evaluate whether the collateral is adequate from the standpoint of quality, marketability, value and income potential. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Character – we evaluate whether the borrower has sound character and integrity by examining the borrower’s history. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Conditions – we underwrite the credit in light of the effects of external factors, such as economic conditions and industry trends. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 It is our practice to obtain collateral for most loans to help mitigate the risk associated with lending. We generally limit our loan-to-value ratio to 85%. For example, we obtain a security interest in real estate for loans secured by real estate. For commercial loans, we typically obtain security interests in equipment and other company assets. For agricultural loans, we typically obtain a security interest in growing crops, farm equipment, or real estate. For consumer loans used to purchase vehicles, we obtain appropriate title documentation. For secured loans that are not associated with real estate, or for which the mortgaged real estate does not provide an acceptable loan-to-value ratio, we typically obtain other available collateral such as stocks or savings accounts.
 Every loan carries a credit risk, simply defined as the potential that the borrower will not be willing or able to repay the debt. While this risk is common to all loan types, each type of loan may carry risks that distinguish it from other loan types. The following paragraphs discuss certain risks that are associated with each of our loan types.
 Each real estate loan is sensitive to fluctuations in the value of the real estate that secures that loan. Certain types of real estate loans have specific risk characteristics that vary according to the type of collateral that secures the loan, the terms of the loan, and the repayment sources for the loan. Construction and development real estate loans generally carry a higher degree of risk than long term financing of existing properties. These projects are usually dependent on the completion of the project on schedule and within cost estimates and on the timely sale of the property. Inferior or improper construction techniques, changes in economic conditions during the construction and marketing period, and rising interest rates which may slow the sale of the property are all risks unique to this type of loan. Residential mortgage loans, in contrast to commercial real estate loans, generally have longer terms and may have fixed or adjustable interest rates.

-

Commercial loans primarily have risk that the primary source of repayment will be insufficient to service the debt. Often this occurs as the result of changes in economic conditions in the location or industry in which the borrower operates which impact cash flow or collateral value. Consumer loans, other than home equity loan products, are generally considered to have more risk than loans to individuals secured by first or second mortgages on real estate due to dependence on the borrower’s employment status as the sole source of repayment. Agricultural loans carry the risk of crop failure, which adversely impacts both the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral, although we partially mitigate these risks by requiring the assignment of multi-peril crop insurance on all such loans.
 By following defined underwriting criteria as noted above, we can help to reduce these risks. Additionally, we help to reduce the risk that the underlying collateral may not be sufficient to pay the outstanding balance by using appraisals or taking other steps to determine that the value of the collateral is adequate, and lending amounts based upon lower loan-to-value ratios. We also control risks by reducing the concentration of our loan portfolio in any one type of loan.
 Loan Approval and Review. Our loan approval policies provide for various levels of officer lending authority. When the amount of aggregate loans to a single borrower exceeds that individual officer’s lending authority, the loan request is considered by an officer with a higher lending limit or committee. Any loan in excess of this lending limit is approved by the directors’ loan committee. We do not make any loans to any of our directors or executive officers unless the loan is approved by a three-fourth’s vote of the board of directors of the Bank and is made on terms not more favorable to such person than would be available to a person not affiliated with us. Aggregate credit in excess of 10% of the Bank’s aggregate capital, surplus, retained earnings, and reserve for loan losses must be approved by a two-thirds vote of our Bank’s board of directors.
 Residential Mortgage Loans. We offer a variety of residential mortgage lending products, including loans with fixed rates for fifteen and thirty years as well as adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). Typically, we close these loans with funds provided by a secondary market investor, although we may close them in the Bank’s name under a pre-approved commitment to sell the loans to an investor within a few weeks from the date the loan is closed.
 Lending Limits. Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal law. While differing limits apply to certain loan types or borrowers, in general we are subject to a loan-to-one-borrower limit. These limits increase or decrease as our capital increases or decreases. Unless we sell participations in loans to other financial institutions, we are not able to meet all of the lending needs of loan customers requiring aggregate extensions of credit above these limits.
 Other Banking and Related Services 
 Other services which are offered by the Bank include cash management services, sweep accounts, repurchase agreements, mobile banking, remote deposit capture, safe deposit boxes, travelers checks, direct deposit of payroll and social security checks, online banking and automatic drafts for various accounts. We are associated with a shared network of automated teller machines that may be used by our customers throughout South Carolina and other regions. We also offer MasterCard and VISA credit card services through a third party vendor. We continue to seek and evaluate opportunities to offer additional financial services to our customers.
Location and Service Area 
 
Our primary markets include Horry and Georgetown Counties, South Carolina and the southern portions of Columbus and Brunswick Counties, North Carolina. Many of the banks in these areas are branches of large regional banks. Although size gives the larger banks certain advantages in competing for business from large corporations, including higher lending limits and the ability to offer services in other areas of South Carolina and North Carolina, we believe that there is a void in the community banking market in our market that we can fill. We generally do not attempt to compete for the banking relationships of large corporations, but concentrate our efforts on small- to medium-sized businesses, individuals, and farmers.
Competition
 The banking business is highly competitive. We compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and money market mutual funds operating in our service area and elsewhere. According to the FDIC data as of June 30, 2016, there were 21 financial institutions operating in Horry County, South Carolina, 13 financial institutions operating in Georgetown County, South Carolina, 12 financial institutions operating in Brunswick County, North Carolina, and 6 financial institutions operating in Columbus County, North Carolina.

We believe that our community bank focus, with our emphasis on service to small businesses, individuals, farmers and professional concerns, gives us an advantage in our markets. Nevertheless, a number of these competitors are well established in our service area. Some of the larger financial companies in our markets may have greater resources than we have, which afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we offer. Banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries that are not subject to bank regulatory restrictions may have larger lending limits that allow them to serve the lending needs of larger customers. Because larger competitors have advantages in attracting business from larger corporations, we do not generally compete for that business. Instead, we concentrate our efforts on attracting the business of individuals and small and medium-size businesses. With regard to such accounts, we generally compete on the basis of customer service and responsiveness to customer needs, the convenience of our branches and hours, and the availability and pricing of our products and services.
 Employees
 As of February 24, 2017, we had 80 full-time employees. We are not a party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 Both the Company and the Bank are subject to extensive state and federal banking laws and regulations that impose specific requirements and restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of their operations. These laws and regulations generally are intended to protect depositors and not shareholders. The following summary is qualified by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed. Changes in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and the policies of various regulatory authorities. We cannot predict the effect that fiscal or monetary policies, economic control, or new federal or state legislation may have on our business and earnings in the future.
 The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by the banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on our operations. It is intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions.
 Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 Although the financial crisis has now passed and the Trump Presidential Administration has created some uncertainty regarding the future climate two legislative and regulatory responses – the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and the Basel III-based capital rules – will likely continue to have a significant impact on our operations.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act specifically impacts financial institutions in numerous ways, including:
 
· | The creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Council responsible for monitoring and managing systemic risk; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Granting additional authority to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the “Federal Reserve”) to regulate certain types of non-bank financial companies; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Granting new authority to the FDIC as liquidator and receiver; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Changing the manner in which deposit insurance assessments are made; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Requiring regulators to modify capital standards; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”); 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capping interchange fees that banks with assets of $10 billion or more charge merchants for debit card transactions; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Imposing more stringent requirements on mortgage lenders; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Limiting banks’ proprietary trading activities. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


There are many provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act mandating regulators to adopt new regulations and conduct studies upon which future regulation may be based. While some have been issued, many remain to be issued. Governmental intervention and new regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Basel Capital Standards. Regulatory capital rules released in July 2013 to implement capital standards, referred to as Basel III and developed by an international body known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with more than $1 billion in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements are imposed on “advanced approaches” banking organizations-those organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures, or that have opted in to the Basel II capital regime. The requirements in the rule began to phase in on January 1, 2015 for the Bank, and the requirements in the rule will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019.
 
The rule includes certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those currently in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements apply to the Bank:
 

· | a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement); and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-

Under the rule, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rule has disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital. Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. The rule provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We made this opt-out election and, as a result, will retain the pre-existing treatment for AOCI.
 
In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally over time, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019, and will consist of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. As of January 1, 2017, the Bank is required to hold a capital conservation buffer of 1.25%, increasing by 0.625% each successive year until 2019.
 
In general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.
 
Volcker Rule. Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the “Volcker Rule,” prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred to collectively as “banking entities”) from engaging in two types of activities: “proprietary trading” and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as “covered funds.” Proprietary trading, in general, is trading in securities on a short-term basis for a banking entity’s own account. Funds subject to the ownership and sponsorship prohibition are those not required to register with the SEC because they have only accredited investors or no more than 100 investors. In December 2013, our primary federal regulators, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC, together with other federal banking agencies, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finalized a regulation to implement the Volcker Rule. At December 31, 2016, the Company has evaluated our securities portfolio and has determined that we do not hold any covered funds.

Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Action
 From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank could have a material effect on the business of the Company.
HCSB Financial Corporation
 We own 100% of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank, and therefore we are considered to be a bank holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “Bank Holding Company Act”). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act and its regulations promulgated thereunder. As a bank holding company located in South Carolina, we are also subject to the South Carolina Banking and Branching Efficiency Act and the State Board also regulates and monitors all significant aspects of our operations.
 Permitted Activities. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in, the following activities:

· | banking or managing or controlling banks; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include:
 
· | factoring accounts receivable; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | leasing personal or real property; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | trust company functions; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | financial and investment advisory activities; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | conducting discount securities brokerage activities; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performing selected data processing services and support services; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performing selected insurance underwriting activities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a bank holding company we also can elect to be treated as a “financial holding company,” which would allow us to engage in a broader array of activities. A financial holding company can engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activities, including insurance underwriting, sales and brokerage activities, financial and investment advisory services, underwriting services and limited merchant banking activities. We have not sought financial holding company status, but may elect such status in the future as our business matures. If we were to elect in writing for financial holding company status, each insured depository institution we control would have to be well capitalized, well managed and have at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”) (discussed below).
 The Federal Reserve has the authority to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.
 Change in Control. Two statutes, the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with regulations promulgated under them, require some form of regulatory review before any company may acquire “control” of a bank or a bank holding company. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, control is deemed to exist if a company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company; controls the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors; or exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of a bank or bank holding company. In guidance issued in 2008, the Federal Reserve has stated that an investor generally will not be viewed as having a controlling influence over a bank holding company when the investor holds, in aggregate, less than 33% of the total equity of a bank or bank holding company (voting and nonvoting equity), provided such investor’s ownership does not include 15% or more of any class of voting securities. Prior Federal Reserve approval is necessary before an entity acquires sufficient control to become a bank holding company. Natural persons, certain non-business trusts, and other entities are not treated as companies (or bank holding companies), and their acquisitions are not subject to review under the Bank Holding Company Act. State laws generally, including South Carolina law, require state approval before an acquirer may become the holding company of a state bank.
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, a person or company is generally required to file a notice with the Federal Reserve if it will, as a result of the transaction, own or control 10% or more of any class of voting securities or direct the management or policies of a bank or bank holding company and either if the bank or bank holding company has registered securities or if the acquirer would be the largest holder of that class of voting securities after the acquisition. For a change in control at the holding company level, both the Federal Reserve and the subsidiary bank’s primary federal regulator must approve the change in control; at the bank level, only the bank’s primary federal regulator is involved. Transactions subject to the Bank Holding Company Act are exempt from Change in Control Act requirements. For state banks, state laws, including that of South Carolina, typically require approval by the state bank regulator as well.
 Source of Strength. There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed by law and regulatory policy on bank holding companies with regard to their depository institution subsidiaries that are designed to minimize potential loss to depositors and to the FDIC insurance funds in the event that the depository institution becomes in danger of defaulting under its obligations to repay deposits. Under policy of the Federal Reserve, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), to avoid receivership of its insured depository institution subsidiary, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become “undercapitalized” within the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the institution’s total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan.
 The Federal Reserve also has the authority under the Bank Holding Company Act to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository institution of the bank holding company. Further, federal law grants federal bank regulatory authorities additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or nonbank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution’s financial condition.

In addition, the “cross guarantee” provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”) require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated by the FDIC as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default. The FDIC’s claim for damages is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company, but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institutions.
 The FDIA also provides that amounts received from the liquidation or other resolution of any insured depository institution by any receiver must be distributed (after payment of secured claims) to pay the deposit liabilities of the institution prior to payment of any other general or unsecured senior liability, subordinated liability, general creditor or shareholder. This provision would give depositors a preference over general and subordinated creditors and shareholders in the event a receiver is appointed to distribute the assets of our Bank.
 Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
 Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve has adopted capital guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications under the Bank Holding Company Act. These guidelines apply on a consolidated basis to bank holding companies with more than $1 billion in assets, or with fewer assets but certain risky activities, and on a bank-only basis to other companies. These bank holding company capital adequacy guidelines are similar to those imposed by the FDIC on the Bank. For a bank holding company with $1 billion or less in total consolidated assets, such as the Company, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company’s subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) approved revisions to their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. For additional information, see the section above entitled “Legislative and Regulatory Developments- Basel Capital Standards” and the section below entitled “Horry County State Bank— Prompt Corrective Action.”
 Subject to our capital requirements and certain other restrictions, we are able to borrow money to make a capital contribution to the Bank, and these loans may be repaid from dividends paid from the Bank to the Company. Our ability to pay dividends depends on, among other things, the Bank’s ability to pay dividends to us, which is subject to regulatory restrictions as described below in the section entitled “Horry County State Bank—Dividends.” In addition, our Company is also prohibited from paying dividends without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. We are also able to raise capital for contribution to the Bank by issuing securities without having to receive regulatory approval, subject to compliance with federal and state securities laws.
 South Carolina State Regulation. As a South Carolina bank holding company under the South Carolina Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, we are subject to limitations on sale or merger and to regulation by the State Board. We are not required to obtain the approval of the South Carolina Board prior to acquiring the capital stock of a national bank, but we must notify them at least 15 days prior to doing so. We must receive the State Board’s approval prior to engaging in the acquisition of a South Carolina state chartered bank or another South Carolina bank holding company.

Horry County State Bank
 As a South Carolina state bank, the Bank’s primary federal regulator is the FDIC, and the Bank is also regulated and subject to examination by the State Board. Deposits in the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to a maximum amount of $250,000. The FDIC insurance coverage limit applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category.
 The State Board and the FDIC regulate or monitor virtually all areas of the Bank’s operations, including:
 
· | security devices and procedures; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequacy of capitalization and loss reserves; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | loans;
--+-------


· | investments;
--+-------------


· | borrowings;
--+------------


· | deposits;
--+----------


· | mergers;
--+---------


· | issuances of securities; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | payment of dividends; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | interest rates payable on deposits; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | interest rates or fees chargeable on loans; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establishment of branches; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | corporate reorganizations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | maintenance of books and records; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequacy of staff training to carry on safe lending and deposit gathering practices. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These agencies, and the federal and state laws applicable to the Bank’s operations, extensively regulate various aspects of our banking business, including, among other things, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments and other activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans and on deposits, the maintenance of reserves on demand deposit liabilities, and the safety and soundness of our banking practices.
 All insured institutions must undergo regular on-site examinations by their appropriate banking agency. The cost of examinations of insured depository institutions and any affiliates may be assessed by the appropriate federal banking agency against each institution or affiliate as it deems necessary or appropriate. Insured institutions are required to submit annual reports to the FDIC, their federal regulatory agency, and state supervisor when applicable. The FDIC has developed a method for insured depository institutions to provide supplemental disclosure of the estimated fair market value of assets and liabilities, to the extent feasible and practicable, in any balance sheet, financial statement, report of condition or any other report of any insured depository institution. The FDIC and the other federal banking regulatory agencies also have issued standards for all insured depository institutions relating, among other things, to the following:
 

· | internal controls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | information systems and audit systems; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | loan documentation; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | credit underwriting; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | interest rate risk exposure; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | asset quality.

Prompt Corrective Action. As an insured depository institution, the Bank is required to comply with the capital requirements promulgated under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the prompt corrective action regulations thereunder, which set forth five capital categories, each with specific regulatory consequences. Under these regulations, the categories are:
 
· | Well Capitalized — The institution exceeds the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. A well capitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater and (v) is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adequately Capitalized — The institution meets the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. No capital distribution may be made that would result in the institution becoming undercapitalized. An adequately capitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Undercapitalized — The institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. An undercapitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, or (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of less than 4%. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Significantly Undercapitalized — The institution is significantly below the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. A significantly undercapitalized institution (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, (iii) has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, or (iv) has a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Critically Undercapitalized — The institution fails to meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency. A critically undercapitalized institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the FDIC determines, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, that a bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition, the regulator is authorized to reclassify the bank to the next lower capital category (other than critically undercapitalized) and require the submission of a plan to correct the unsafe or unsound condition.
 If a bank is not well capitalized, it cannot accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. In addition, a bank that is not well capitalized cannot offer an effective yield in excess of 75 basis points over interest paid on deposits of comparable size and maturity in such institution’s normal market area for deposits accepted from within its normal market area, or national rate paid on deposits of comparable size and maturity for deposits accepted outside the bank’s normal market area. Moreover, the FDIC generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be categorized as undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations (an undercapitalized institution may not acquire another institution, establish additional branch offices or engage in any new line of business unless determined by the appropriate federal banking agency to be consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan, or unless the FDIC determines that the proposed action will further the purpose of prompt corrective action) and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became categorized as undercapitalized or the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is categorized as significantly undercapitalized.
  
15
--

Significantly undercapitalized categorized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become categorized as adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. The appropriate federal banking agency may take any action authorized for a significantly undercapitalized institution if an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the agency. A critically undercapitalized institution is subject to having a receiver or conservator appointed to manage its affairs and for loss of its charter to conduct banking activities.
 An insured depository institution may not pay a management fee to a bank holding company controlling that institution or any other person having control of the institution if, after making the payment, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition, an institution cannot make a capital distribution, such as a dividend or other distribution, that is in substance a distribution of capital to the owners of the institution if following such a distribution the institution would be undercapitalized. Thus, if payment of such a management fee or the making of such would cause a bank to become undercapitalized, it could not pay a management fee or dividend to the bank holding company.
 At December 31, 2016, the Bank exceeded all capital requirements to which it was subject.
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. The FDIA also requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate risk exposure; and (v) asset growth. The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees, and benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if the FDIC determines that the Bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the Bank to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard, as required by the FDIC. The final regulations establish deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.
 Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. Various legal limitations restrict the Bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds to the Company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The Company and the Bank are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W.
 Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act places limits on the amount of loans or extensions of credit by a bank to any affiliate, including its holding company, on a bank’s investments in, or certain other transactions with, affiliates and on the amount of advances by a bank to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates of the bank. Section 23A also applies to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions that cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, each covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements. The Bank is forbidden from purchasing low quality assets from an affiliate.
 Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. If there are no comparable transactions, a bank’s (or one of its subsidiaries’) affiliate transaction must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, nonaffiliated companies. These requirements apply to all transactions subject to Section 23A as well as to certain other transactions.
 The affiliates of a bank include any holding company of the bank, any other company under common control with the bank (including any company controlled by the same shareholders who control the bank), any subsidiary of the bank that is itself a bank, any company in which the majority of the directors or trustees also constitute a majority of the directors or trustees of the bank or holding company of the bank, any company sponsored and advised on a contractual basis by the bank or an affiliate, and any mutual fund advised by a bank or any of the bank’s affiliates. Regulation W generally excludes all non-bank and non-savings association subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates, except to the extent that the Federal Reserve decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates.

The Bank is also subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders, and their related interests. Extensions of credit include derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions to the extent that such transactions cause a bank to have credit exposure to an insider. Any extension of credit to an insider (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral requirements, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated third parties and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. In some circumstances, approval of an extension of credit to an insider must be approved by a majority of the disinterested directors. Extension of credit to any one insider are capped at 10% of a bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, with an additional 10% for loans secured by readily marketable collateral. Extensions of credit to all insiders are capped at 100% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
 Branching. Under current South Carolina law, the Bank may open branch offices throughout South Carolina with the prior approval of the State Board. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, the Bank is able to acquire existing banking operations in South Carolina. Furthermore, federal legislation permits interstate branching, including out-of-state acquisitions by bank holding companies, interstate branching by banks, and interstate merging by banks. The Dodd-Frank Act removes previous state law restrictions on de novo interstate branching in states such as South Carolina. This change permits out-of-state banks to open de novo branches in states where the laws of the state where the de novo branch to be opened would permit a bank chartered by that state to open a de novo branch.
 Anti-Tying Restrictions. Under amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act and Federal Reserve regulations, a bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers. In general, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the bank, the bank holding company or subsidiaries thereof or (ii) the customer may not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. Certain arrangements are permissible: a bank may offer combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products; and certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule. Bank holding companies and bank affiliates are also subject to anti-tying requirements in connection with electronic benefit transfer services.
 Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA requires that the FDIC evaluate the record of the Bank in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. This record is considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately address the needs for bank products and services in low- and moderate-income communities and of low- and moderate-income individuals could result in the imposition of additional requirements and limitations on our Bank.
 The Gramm Leach Bliley Act (the “GLBA”) made various changes to the CRA. Among other changes CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must be made available to a bank’s primary federal regulator. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under the GLBA may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a satisfactory CRA rating in its latest CRA examination.
 On January 1, 2015, the date of the most recent examination, the Bank received a satisfactory CRA rating.
 Financial Subsidiaries. Under the GLBA, subject to certain conditions imposed by their respective banking regulators, national and state-chartered banks are permitted to form “financial subsidiaries” that may conduct financial or incidental activities, thereby permitting bank subsidiaries to engage in certain activities that previously were impermissible. The GLBA imposes several safeguards and restrictions on financial subsidiaries, including that the parent bank’s equity investment in the financial subsidiary be deducted from the bank’s assets and tangible equity for purposes of calculating the bank’s capital adequacy. In addition, the GLBA imposes new restrictions on transactions between a bank and its financial subsidiaries similar to restrictions applicable to transactions between banks and non-bank affiliates. As of December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any financial subsidiaries.

· | the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires depository institutions to provide disclosures so that consumers can make meaningful comparisons about depository institutions and accounts. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Enforcement Powers. The Bank and its “institution-affiliated parties,” including its management, employees, agents, independent contractors, and consultants such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution’s affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a government agency. These practices can include the failure of an institution to timely file required reports or the filing of false or misleading information or the submission of inaccurate reports. Civil penalties may be as high as $1,000,000 a day for such violations. Criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes have been increased to 20 years. In addition, regulators have considerable flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties. Possible enforcement actions include the termination of deposit insurance. Furthermore, banking agencies’ power to issue cease-and-desist orders were expanded. Such orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate.
 The number of government entities authorized to take action against the Bank has expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC continues to have primary enforcement authority. In addition, The CFPB also has back-up enforcement authority with respect to the consumer protection statutes above. Specifically, the CFPB may request reports from and conduct limited examinations of the Bank in conducting investigations involving the consumer protection statutes. Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions or other proceedings under the Dodd-Frank Act or regulations against state-chartered banks, including the Bank. Prior notice to the CFPB and the FDIC would be necessary for a state civil action against the Bank.

Anti-Money Laundering. Financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. The Company and the Bank are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and “knowing your customer” in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks. Anti-money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the USA Patriot Act, enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications. The regulatory authorities have been active in imposing “cease and desist” orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions that have not complied with these requirements.
 USA PATRIOT Act/Bank Secrecy Act. Financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. The USA PATRIOT Act, amended, in part, the Bank Secrecy Act and provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering by enhancing anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government, including: (i) standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; (ii) rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; (iii) reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; and (iv) suspicious activities reports by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations and enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications.
 
Under the USA PATRIOT Act, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) can send our banking regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. The Bank can be requested to search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists. If the Bank finds any relationships or transactions, it must file a suspicious activity report and contact the FBI.
 The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which is a division of the U.S. Treasury, is responsible for helping to insure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with “enemies” of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC has sent, and will send, our banking regulatory agencies lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts. If the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report and notify the FBI. The Bank has appointed an OFAC compliance officer to oversee the inspection of its accounts and the filing of any notifications. The Bank actively checks high-risk OFAC areas such as new accounts, wire transfers and customer files. The Bank performs these checks utilizing software, which is updated each time a modification is made to the lists provided by OFAC and other agencies of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.
 Privacy, Data Security, and Credit Reporting. Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under narrow circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. It is the Bank’s policy not to disclose any personal information unless required by law.
 Recent cyber attacks against banks and other institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information have prompted the Federal banking agencies to issue several warnings and extensive guidance on cyber security. The agencies are likely to devote more resources to this part of their safety and soundness examination than they have in the past.

In addition, pursuant to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the “FACT Act”) and the implementing regulations of the federal banking agencies and Federal Trade Commission, the Bank is required to have in place an “identity theft red flags” program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft. The Bank has implemented an identity theft red flags program designed to meet the requirements of the FACT Act and the joint final rules. Additionally, the FACT Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to generally prohibit a person from using information received from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer, unless the consumer is given notice and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to opt out of the making of such solicitations.
 Payment of Dividends. A South Carolina state bank may not pay dividends from its capital. All dividends must be paid out of undivided profits then on hand, after deducting expenses, including reserves for losses and bad debts. In addition, under the FDICIA, the Bank may not pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the Bank would be undercapitalized. As a result of regulatory restrictions that remain following the termination of the Consent Order, the Bank is currently prohibited from paying dividends to the Company without the prior approval of the FDIC and the State Board.
 Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies. Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have major effects upon the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
 Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the insurance fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions, after giving a bank’s regulatory authority an opportunity to take such action, and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.
 FDIC insured institutions are required to pay a Financing Corporation assessment to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. The Financing Corporation quarterly assessment for the fourth quarter of 2015 equaled 1.45 basis points for each $100 of average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. These assessments, which may be revised based upon the level of deposits, will continue until the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019.
 The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance.
 Incentive Compensation. In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC issued a comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
 The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies, the SEC, and certain other federal agencies to jointly issue a regulation on incentive compensation. The agencies proposed such a rule in 2011, which reflected the 2010 guidance. However, the 2011 proposal was replaced with a new proposed rule in May 2016, which makes explicit that the involvement of risk management and control personnel includes not only compliance, risk management and internal audit, but also legal, human resources, accounting, financial reporting and finance roles responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring or controlling risk-taking. A final rule had not been adopted as of December 31, 2016.
