Item 1. Business
Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “Elevate,” “company,” “we,” “us” and “our” used below refer to Elevate Credit, Inc. and, where appropriate, our wholly owned subsidiaries, as well as the direct lending and branded product business of our predecessor, Think Finance, Inc. ("TFI"), for periods prior to our 2014 spin-off from TFI. We generally refer to loans, customers and other information and data associated with each of Rise, Elastic and Sunny as Elevate’s loans, customers, information and data, irrespective of whether Elevate originates the credit to the customer or whether such credit is originated by a third party. 
OUR COMPANY
We provide online credit solutions to consumers in the United States (the "US") and the United Kingdom (the "UK") who are not well-served by traditional bank products and who are looking for better options than payday loans, title loans, pawn and storefront installment loans. Non-prime consumers—approximately 170 million people in the US and UK, typically defined as those with credit scores of less than 700—now represent a larger market than prime consumers but are difficult to underwrite and serve with traditional approaches. We’re succeeding at it—and doing it responsibly—with best-in-class advanced technology and proprietary risk analytics honed by serving more than 1.9 million customers with $5.2 billion in credit. Our current online credit products, Rise, Elastic and Sunny, reflect our mission to provide customers with access to competitively priced credit and services while helping them build a brighter financial future with credit building and financial wellness features. We call this mission "Good Today, Better Tomorrow."
We have experienced rapid growth since launching our current generation of products in 2013. As of December 31, 2017, Rise, Elastic and Sunny, together, have provided approximately $3.8 billion in credit to approximately 1.1 million customers and generated strong revenue growth. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 grew 16% to $673.1 million from $580.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our operating income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $70.9 million and $47.8 million, respectively, and our total assets for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $687 million and $570 million, respectively. We have committed, diversified funding sources to support our growth. Rise, Elastic and Sunny are funded by six different sources through five lending facilities (including three facilities related to our Rise CSO relationships in Texas and Ohio). See "Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources."
Along with increased revenue growth and improving operating margins, we have also reduced the effective APR of our products for our customers.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, our effective APR was 131%, a drop of approximately 48% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 when the effective APR was 251%. We estimate that, since 2013, our products have saved our customers more than $3 billion over what they would have paid for payday loans, based on a comparison of revenues from our combined loan portfolio and the same portfolio with an APR of 400%, which is the approximate average APR for a payday loan according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"). As of December 31, 2017, more than 35,000 Rise customers in good standing were eligible to receive at least a 50% reduction in their APR, and more than 13,000 customers were eligible to receive near-prime interest rates of 36% based on their on-time repayment history. Furthermore, with help from our reporting their successful payment history to a major credit bureau, 140,000 of our customers have seen their credit scores improve appreciably, according to data from that credit bureau. We believe that these rate reductions and other benefits help differentiate our products in the market and reflect improvements in our underwriting and the maturing of our loan portfolios. Moreover, we believe doing business this way is the right thing to do.

1. Represents effective APR for calendar year 2013.
2. Our business is subject to seasonality, which is particularly evident in the first quarter of every year. See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Key Financial and Operating Metrics—Revenue growth.”

We believe our growth demonstrates our ability to rapidly scale our business by utilizing our advanced technology platform, proprietary risk analytics and sophisticated multi-channel marketing capabilities. The chart above details our total combined loans receivable and revenues and effective APR of the customer loan portfolio by quarter since the third quarter of 2013.
Our products in the US and the UK are:

Ø | Rise. A product available as an installment loan in 15 US states and, in two additional US states, as a line of credit; 


Ø | Elastic. A line of credit product originated by a third-party bank and offered in 40 states in the US; and 


Ø | Sunny. An installment loan product available in the UK. 

We differentiate ourselves in the following ways:

Ø | Online and mobile products that are “Good Today, Better Tomorrow.” Our products are “Good Today” because they help solve our customers’ immediate financial needs with competitively priced credit and a simple online application process that provides credit decisions in seconds and funds as soon as the next business day (in the US) or in minutes (in the UK). We are committed to transparent pricing with no prepayment penalties or punitive fees as well as amortizing loan balances and flexible repayment schedules that let customers design the loan repayment terms that they can afford. Our five-day risk-free guarantee provides confidence to customers that if they can find a better financial solution within that time they simply repay the principal with no other fees. In addition, our products are “Better Tomorrow” because they reward successful payment history with rates on subsequent loans (installment loan products) that can decrease over time and can help customers improve their long-term financial well-being with features like credit bureau reporting, free credit monitoring (for US customers), and online financial literacy videos and tools.

Ø | Industry-leading technology and proprietary risk analytics optimized for the non-prime credit market. We have made substantial investments in our IQ and DORA technology and analytics platforms to support rapid scaling and innovation, robust regulatory compliance, and ongoing improvements in underwriting. Our proven IQ technology platform provides for nimble testing and optimization of our user interface and underwriting strategies, highly automated loan originations, cost-effective servicing, and robust compliance oversight. Our DORA risk analytics infrastructure utilizes a massive (approximately 80 terabyte) Hadoop database composed of more than ten thousand potential data variables related to each of the 1.9 million customers we have served and the over 6.5 million applications that we have processed. Our team of over 35 data scientists uses DORA to build and test scores and strategies across the entire underwriting process, including segmented credit scores, fraud scores, affordability scores and former customer scores. We use a variety of analytical techniques from traditional multivariate regression to machine learning and artificial intelligence to continue to enhance our underwriting accuracy while complying with applicable US and UK lending laws and regulations. As a result of our proprietary technology and risk analytics, approximately 95% of loan applications are automatically decisioned in seconds with no manual review required. 


Ø | Integrated multi-channel marketing strategy. We use an integrated multi-channel marketing strategy to directly reach potential customers. Our marketing strategy includes coordinated direct mail programs, TV campaigns, search engine marketing and digital campaigns as well as strategic partnerships. We believe our direct-to-consumer approach allows us to focus on higher quality, lower cost customer acquisitions while maximizing reach and enhancing awareness of our products as trusted brands. We have maintained steady customer acquisition costs over the past four years within the range of $230 to $300. Approximately 85% of our customers during 2017 were sourced from direct marketing channels. We continue to invest in new marketing channels, including social media and geo-fencing campaigns, which we believe will provide us with further competitive advantages and support our ongoing growth. We expect to continue to expand growth in each of our channels based on improved customer targeting analytics and increasingly sophisticated response models that allow us to expand our marketing reach while maintaining target customer acquisition costs (“CAC”). 

Our seasoned management team has, on average, more than 15 years of online technology and financial services experience and has worked together for an average of over eight years in the non-prime consumer credit industry. Our management team has overseen the origination of $5.2 billion in credit to 1.9 million customers for the combined current and predecessor direct lending and branded products business that was contributed to Elevate in our spin-off from TFI. In addition, our management team achieved stable credit performance for our predecessor products through the last decade's financial crisis, maintaining total principal losses as a percentage of loan originations of between 17% and 20% each year from 2006 through 2011. See “—Advanced Analytics and Risk Management—History of stable credit quality through the economic downturn.”
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Non-prime consumers represent the largest segment of the credit market
We provide credit to non-prime consumers, many of whom face reduced credit options and increased financial pressure due to macro-economic changes over the past few decades. We believe that this segment of the population represents a massive and underserved market of approximately 170 million consumers in the US and UK—a larger population than the market for prime credit and over half of the US adult population:

Ø | According to an analysis of TransUnion data through the third quarter of 2014 by the Corporation for Enterprise Development, approximately 56% of the US adult population with a TransRisk Score (TransUnion’s credit score) had a non-prime credit score of less than 700, representing approximately 109 million Americans adults.


Ø | Approximately 22% of Americans over the age of 18, or approximately 53 million Americans, do not have a credit score at all or had credit records that were treated as “unscorable” by traditional credit scoring models used by nationwide credit reporting agencies, according to a 2015 report by Fair Isaac Corporation.


Ø | According to a House of Commons report covering the years 2013 and 2014, it is estimated that the UK “non-standard” credit market consisted of approximately 10 million people.

Our typical customers in both the US and UK are middle-income and have a mainstream demographic profile as illustrated below, according to a 2017 Elevate analyses of income and homeownership of customers, including self-reported customer information. This is in line with the average of the populations of the US and UK, respectively, in terms of income, educational background and rate of homeownership. We refer to them as the “New Middle Class.”

Our customers have varying credit profiles, and are more likely to be turned down for credit by many traditional bank lenders. They are risky and can be difficult to underwrite—often due to factors outside of their control. To provide insight into the different types of credit histories and financial needs facing our non-prime customers and the challenges of serving them, the following categories are illustrative:

Ø | “Prime-ish.” Consumers with significant credit history and access to traditional credit sources who are now looking for non-bank credit. They may be over-extended on their existing credit sources and their creditworthiness may be eroding. 


Ø | “Challenged.” Consumers who have had traditional credit in the past but experienced defaults or had a history of late payments and as a result may now use alternative non-prime products such as payday, pawn and title loans. 


Ø | “Invisibles.” Consumers with no credit history or such minimal credit experience that they cannot be sufficiently scored by traditional means and as a result are often kept outside the traditional credit markets. These consumers often have limited or no credit profile and may have a high chance of potential fraud. 

These categories do not correspond to specific credit score bands or precise scores or definitions for the customers included in such categories. We continue to identify additional customer categories and evolve our customer category definitions over time.
The New Middle Class has an unmet need for credit
Due to wage stagnation over the past several decades and the continued impact of the last decade's financial crisis, the New Middle Class is characterized by a lack of savings and significant income volatility. According to a Federal Reserve survey in 2015, 46% of American adults said they could not cover an emergency expense of $400, or would cover it by selling an asset or borrowing money. In the UK, according to a report by Friends Provident Foundation surveying over 1,500 adult consumers in the lowest 50% of household incomes in the UK in 2010, 68% of low-income households had no savings and seven in ten low-income households would find it difficult or impossible to raise from £200 to £300 in an emergency. Further, the JPMorgan Chase Institute reported in a 2015 study of 100,000 US customers that 41% saw their incomes vary by more than 30% from month-to-month, and noted that the bottom 80% of households by income lacked sufficient savings to cover the volatility observed in income and spending. Compounding these financial realities is the fact that average household income has remained flat for over a decade. In fact, according to the US Census Bureau, the average US household income dropped 2.4% between 1999 and 2015. As a result, our customer base often must rely on credit to fund unexpected expenses, like car and home repairs or medical emergencies.
Non-prime credit can be less vulnerable to recessionary factors
Based on our own experiences during the last decade’s financial crisis, as well as research conducted by the credit bureau TransUnion, we believe that patterns of credit charge-offs for non-prime consumers can be acyclical or counter-cyclical when compared to prime consumers in credit downturns. In a recession, banks and traditional prime credit providers often experience increases in credit charge-off rates and tighten standards which reduces access to traditional credit and pushes certain consumers out of the market for bank credit. Conversely, with advanced underwriting, lenders serving non-prime consumers are able to maintain comparatively flat charge-off rates in part because of these new customers who are unable to avail themselves of the traditional credit market. See “—Advanced Analytics and Risk Management—History of stable credit quality through the economic downturn.”

Non-prime consumers have different needs for credit
Non-prime consumers generally have unique and immediate credit needs, which differ greatly from the typical prime consumer. Where prime consumers consider price most in selecting their credit products, we believe that non-prime consumers will often consider a variety of features, including the simplicity of the application process, speed of decisioning and funding, how they will be treated if they cannot pay their loan back on time, and flexible repayment terms.
Banks do not adequately serve the New Middle Class
Following the last decade's financial crisis, most banks tightened their underwriting standards and increased their minimum FICO score requirements for borrowers, leaving non-prime borrowers with severely reduced access to traditional credit. Despite the improving economy, banks continue to underserve the New Middle Class. According to our analysis of master pool trust data of securitizations for the five major credit card issuers, we estimate that from 2008 to 2016 revolving credit available to US borrowers with a FICO score of less than a 660 was reduced by approximately $142 billion. This reduction has had a profound impact on non-prime consumers in the US and UK who typically have little to no savings. Often, the only credit-like product offered by banks that is available to non-prime borrowers is overdraft protection, which in essence provides credit at extremely high rates. According to a 2008 study by the FDIC, bank overdraft fees can have an effective APR of greater than 3,500%, depending upon the amount of the overdraft transaction and the length of time to bring the account positive.
Legacy non-prime lenders are not innovative
As a result of limited access to credit products offered by banks, the New Middle Class has historically had to rely on a variety of legacy non-prime lenders, such as storefront installment lenders, payday lenders, title lenders, pawn and rent-to-own providers that typically do not offer customers the convenience of online and mobile access. While legacy non-prime credit products may fulfill a borrower’s immediate funding needs, many of these products have significant drawbacks for consumers, including a potential cycle of debt, higher interest rates, punitive fees and aggressive collection tactics. Additionally, legacy non-prime lenders do not typically report to major credit bureaus, so non-prime consumers often remain in a cycle of non-prime and rarely improve their financial options.
Fintech startups have largely ignored the non-prime credit market 
Despite the growing and unmet need for non-prime credit, few innovative solutions tailored for non-prime consumers have come to market and achieved any meaningful scale. Where new online marketplace lenders and small business lenders have emerged to serve prime consumers, we believe that non-prime consumers still have relatively few responsible online credit options. We believe this is because underwriting non-prime consumers presents significantly greater analytical challenges than underwriting prime consumers. Unlike prime consumers, the credit profiles of non-prime consumers vary greatly and may contain significant derogatory information, yet non-prime consumers expect instant decisions with a minimum of paperwork and inconvenience. While new data and techniques can assist in improving underwriting capabilities, we believe lenders still require deep insight and extensive experience to successfully serve non-prime consumers while maintaining target loss rates. Additionally, we believe the compliance and other systems necessary to serve non-prime consumers in a manner consistent with regulatory requirements can be a barrier to entry. Having originated $5.2 billion in credit to more than 1.9 million customers, we believe we have a significant lead over new entrants.
Consumers are embracing the internet for their personal finances
Consumers are increasingly turning to online and mobile solutions to fulfill their personal finance needs. A 2015 study published by the CFI Group found that 88% of bank customers surveyed in the US conduct about half to all of their banking online. In the UK, 61% of people choose to do their banking or pay their bills online, according to a 2015 report by the Financial Inclusion Commission. Additionally, according to a 2015 report by the Center for Economics and Business Research, 53% of UK adults used the internet for their banking needs and this proportion is projected to grow to 66% of UK adults by 2020. We believe this growth is an indication of borrower preferences for online and mobile financial products that are more convenient and easier to access than products provided by legacy brick-and-mortar lenders.
OUR SOLUTIONS
Our innovative online credit solutions provide immediate relief to customers today and can help them build a brighter financial future. We call this mission “Good Today, Better Tomorrow” and it drives our product design. Elevate’s current generation of credit products includes Rise, Elastic and Sunny. See “—Our Products.”

We provide more convenient, competitively priced financial solutions to our customers, who are not well-served by either banks or legacy non-prime lenders, by using our advanced technology platform and proprietary risk analytics. We also offer a number of financial wellness and consumer-friendly features such as rates that can go down over time, no punitive fees, a five-day risk-free guarantee, free online financial literacy videos and tools, credit bureau reporting and free credit monitoring (in the US) that we believe are unmatched in the non-prime lending market. 
We have made substantial investments in our IQ and DORA technology and analytics platforms to support rapid scaling and innovation, robust regulatory compliance, and ongoing improvements in underwriting. We have also established a research organization focused on non-prime consumers called the “Center for the New Middle Class” to raise the awareness of their unique needs and to guide our product development. As a result, we believe we are leading a new breed of more responsible online credit providers for the New Middle Class.
Our products provide the following key benefits:

Ø | Competitive pricing with no hidden or punitive fees. Our US products offer rates that we believe are typically more than 50% lower than many generally available alternatives from legacy non-prime lenders, and since 2013 have saved our customers more than $3 billion over what they would have paid for payday loans. Our products offer rates on subsequent loans (installment loan products) that can decrease over time based on successful loan payment history. For instance, as of December 31, 2017, approximately one-third of Rise customers in good standing had received a rate reduction, typically after a refinance or on a subsequent loan. In addition, in order to help our customers facing financial hardships, we have eliminated punitive fees, including returned payment fees and late charges, among others. 


Ø | Access and convenience. We provide convenient, easy-to-use products via online and mobile platforms. Consumers are able to apply using a mobile-optimized online application, which takes only minutes to complete from a mobile or desktop device. Credit determinations are made in seconds and approximately 95% of loan applications are fully automated with no manual review required. Funds are typically available next-day in the US and within minutes in the UK. Consumers can elect to make payments via preapproved automated clearinghouse (“ACH”) authorization or other methods such as check or debit card transfer. 


Ø | Flexible payment terms and responsible lending features. Our customers can select a payment schedule that fits their needs with no prepayment penalties. We do not offer any “single-payment” or “balloon-payment” credit products that can lead to a cycle of debt and are criticized by many consumer groups as well as the CFPB. To ensure that consumers fully understand the product and their alternatives, we provide extensive “Know Before You Borrow” disclosures as well as an industry-leading five-day “Risk-Free Guarantee” during which customers can rescind their loan at no cost. Consistent with our goal of being sensitive to the unique needs of non-prime consumers, we also offer flexible solutions to help customers facing issues impacting their ability to make scheduled payments. Our solutions include notifications before payment processing, extended due dates, grace periods, payment plans, special payment programs and settlement offers. 


Ø | Financial wellness features. Our products include credit building and financial wellness programs, such as credit reporting, free credit monitoring (in the US) and online financial literacy videos and tools. Our goal is to help our customers improve their financial options and behaviors at no additional charge. We are very proud of the fact that, with help from our reporting their successful payment history to a major credit bureau, more than 140,000 of our customers have seen an appreciable increase in their credit scores, according to data from that credit bureau. 

This combination of features has resulted in extremely high customer satisfaction for our products. Internal customer satisfaction ratings are generally over 85% for all of our products during 2017.

OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
Using our IQ technology platform and DORA risk analytics infrastructure, we are able to offer our customers innovative credit solutions that place us as a leader among a new breed of more responsible, online non-prime lenders. We believe the following are our key competitive advantages:

Ø | Differentiated online and mobile products for non-prime consumers. Our product development is driven by a deep commitment to solving customers’ immediate financial need for credit and helping them improve their long-term financial future. We call this mission “Good Today, Better Tomorrow.” Our products are “good today” due to their convenience, cost, transparency and flexibility. Our average customer receives an interest rate that we believe is more than 50% less than that offered by many legacy non-prime lenders. In fact, since 2013 our customers have saved more than $3 billion over what they would have paid for payday loans based on a comparison of revenues from our combined loan portfolio and the same portfolio with an APR of 400%, which is the approximate average APR for a payday loan according to the CFPB. Furthermore, the convenience of online and mobile access and flexible repayment options distinguish our products from many legacy non-prime credit options. However, we go even further in creating credit products that can help enable customers to have a “better tomorrow.” Based on successful payment history, rates on subsequent loans (installment loan products) can decrease over time, and we provide a path to prime credit for struggling consumers by reporting to credit bureaus, providing free credit monitoring (for US products), and offering online financial literacy videos and tools to help build better financial management skills. With help from our reporting their successful payment history to a major credit bureau, more than 140,000 of our customers have seen their credit scores improve appreciably, according to data from that credit bureau. 


Ø | Industry-leading DORA risk analytics infrastructure and underwriting scores. Traditional approaches for underwriting credit such as FICO scores are not adequate for non-prime consumers who may have significant derogatory credit history or no credit history at all. Because continued leadership in non-prime underwriting is essential to drive growth, support continued rate reductions to customers, and manage losses, we built our DORA risk analytics infrastructure to support the development and enhancement of our underwriting scores and strategies. The DORA risk analytics infrastructure utilizes a massive (approximately 80 terabyte) Hadoop database composed of more than ten thousand potential data variables related to each of the 1.9 million customers we have served and the over 6.5 million applications that we have processed. This data is composed of variables from consumer applications and website behavior, credit bureaus, numerous other alternative third party data providers as well as performance history for funded customers. Our team of over 35 data scientists uses DORA to build and test scores and strategies across the entire underwriting process including segmented credit scores, fraud scores, affordability scores and former customer scores. They use a variety of analytical techniques from traditional multivariate regression to machine learning and artificial intelligence to continue to enhance our underwriting accuracy while complying with applicable US and UK lending laws and regulations. See “—Advanced Analytics and Risk Management—Segmentation strategies across the entire underwriting process.” Across the portfolio of products we currently offer, we have maintained stable credit quality as evidenced by charge-off rates that are generally between 25% and 30% of the original principal loan balances. While we experience month-to-month variability in our loan losses for any variety of reasons, including due to seasonality, on an annual basis, our annual principal charge-off rates have remained consistent since the launch of our current generation of products in 2013. See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Key Financial and Operating Metrics—Credit quality.” Furthermore, our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models allow not only for the scoring of a broad range of non-prime consumers, but also across a variety of products, channels, geographies and regulatory requirements. 


Ø | Innovative and flexible IQ technology platform. Investment in our flexible and scalable IQ technology platform has enabled us to rapidly grow and innovate new products - notably supporting the launch of our current generation of products in 2013. Our IQ technology platform provides for nimble testing and optimization of our user interface and underwriting strategies, highly automated loan originations, cost-effective servicing, and robust compliance oversight. In addition, our platform is adaptable to allow us to enhance current products or launch future online products to meet evolving consumer preferences and respond to a dynamic regulatory environment. Further, our open architecture allows us to easily integrate with best-in-class third-party providers, including strategic partners, data sources and outsourced vendors. 

12


Ø | Integrated multi-channel marketing approach. Unlike other online non-prime lenders, who typically rely on lead generators to identify potential customers, we use an integrated multi-channel marketing strategy to market directly to potential customers, which includes coordinated direct mail programs, TV campaigns, search engine marketing and digital campaigns, and strategic partnerships. We have created unique capabilities to effectively identify and attract qualified customers, which supports our long-term growth objectives at target customer acquisition costs. We have maintained steady customer acquisition costs over the past four years within the range of $230 to $300. Approximately 85% of our customers for the year ended December 31, 2017 were sourced from direct marketing channels. We believe this approach allows us to focus on higher quality, lower cost customer acquisition while maximizing reach and enhancing awareness of our products as trusted brands. We continue to invest in new marketing channels, including social media and geo-fencing campaigns, which we believe will provide us with further competitive advantages and support our ongoing growth. In 2017, this included the launch of blogs at both Rise and Sunny. 


Ø | Seasoned management team with strong industry track record. We have a seasoned team of senior executives with an average of more than 15 years of experience in online technology and financial services at companies such as Citibank, Bank of America, MasterCard, PayPal, GE Capital, BlackRock and Silicon Valley Bank, led by Ken Rees, a financial services industry veteran with more than 20 years of experience, who is regarded as one of the leading advocates of responsible credit in the non-prime lending space. Mr. Rees was named to Bank Innovation's "2017 Innovators to Watch" list, and in 2012 he was named Regional Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young in recognition of his achievements in the online lending sector. The team has overseen the origination of $5.2 billion in credit to more than 1.9 million customers for the combined current and predecessor products that were contributed to Elevate in our spin-off from TFI. Additionally, the team has a proven track record of managing defaults through the last decade's financial crisis. From 2006 to 2011, the principal charge-offs of Elevate's legacy and predecessor credit products remained comparatively flat compared to credit card charge-off rates which nearly tripled during the same period. Elevate was certified as a “Great Place To Work” in 2017 and as one of the “Best Workplaces in Texas” by consulting firm Great Place to Work and Fortune. We believe this reflects our commitment to build a strong and lasting company and a customer-focused corporate culture. 

OUR GROWTH STRATEGY
To achieve our goal of being the preeminent online lender to the New Middle Class, we intend to execute the following strategies:

Ø | Continue to grow our current products into dominant brands. Our current generation of products, Rise, Elastic and Sunny, were launched in 2013. Given strong consumer demand and organic growth potential, we believe that significant opportunities exist to expand these three products within their current markets via existing marketing channels. As non-prime consumers become increasingly familiar and comfortable with online and mobile financial services, we also plan to capture the new business generated as they migrate away from less convenient legacy brick-and-mortar lenders. 


Ø | Widen the credit spectrum of borrowers served with new products. We continue to evaluate new product and market opportunities that fit into our overall strategic objective of delivering next-generation online and mobile credit products that span the non-prime credit spectrum. For example, we are evaluating products with lower rates that would be more focused on the needs of near-prime consumers. In addition, we are continually focused on improving our analytics to effectively underwrite and serve consumers within those segments of the non-prime credit spectrum that we do not currently reach. 


Ø | Pursue additional strategic partnerships. Our progressive non-prime credit solutions have attracted top-tier affiliate partners including Credit Karma and Lending Tree as a way to serve customers they have acquired. We intend to continue growing our existing affiliate partnerships and will evaluate opportunities to enter into new partnerships with affiliates and retailers and potentially enable non-prime customers to purchase their goods and services on credit. We expect these partnerships to provide us with access to a broad range of potential new customers with low customer acquisition costs. In addition, we will pursue further strategic partnerships with banks. 


Ø | Expand our relationship with existing customers. Customer acquisition costs represent one of the most significant expenses for online lenders. We will seek to expand our strong relationships with existing customers by providing qualified customers with new loans on improved terms or offering other products and services. We believe we can better serve our customers with improved products and services while, at the same time, achieving better operating leverage. 


Ø | Enter new markets. We will explore pursuing strategic opportunities to expand into additional international and domestic markets. However, we plan to take a disciplined approach to international expansion, utilizing customized products and in-market expertise. As reflected in our approach to entering the UK market, we believe that local teams with products developed for each unique local market will ultimately be the most successful. We currently do not expect to undertake any international expansion in the near term.

Rise—US installment loans and lines of credit
Rise is an installment loan and line of credit product currently available in 17 states in the US. We utilize risk-based pricing across the portfolio to optimally serve a large percentage of non-prime customers with starting rates ranging from 36% to 299%. There are no origination fees, monthly fees, late fees, over-limit fees, or fees for returned payments on the product. After 24 months of on-time installment loan payments, eligible customers can receive a 50% rate reduction on their next loan, limited to a resulting rate of 36%. The installment loan product is available in 15 states. After an additional 12 months of installment loan on-time payments on a subsequent loan, rates on new loans drop to 36% for qualifying customers. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 33% of Rise installment customers in good standing had received a rate reduction mid-loan or after a refinance or on a subsequent loan. We no longer provide rate reductions mid-loan as our current policy is to award qualified customers with rate reductions once they refinance or take out a new loan. Approximately 56% of Rise installment customers in good standing had refinanced or taken out a subsequent loan as of December 31, 2017, with 48% of the outstanding Rise installment loan balances on that date consisting of new customer loans and 52% related to returning customer loans. The Rise installment effective APR was 140% for the year ended December 31, 2017, which we believe is more than 50% lower than the average effective rate of a typical payday loan, based on the CFPB’s findings that the average APR for a payday loan is approximately 400%. 
The Rise line of credit product, which was launched in 2017, is available in two states given current applicable state law, and is designed to be a financial safety net for non-prime consumers. Rise line of credit offers a maximum credit limit of $5,000 and charges interest based on the APR of the loan and the average balance for the period. The Rise line of credit effective APR was 186% for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
As a result of differing state laws, the structure of Rise varies: Rise is currently offered as an installment loan ("Rise installment"), a line of credit loan product ("Rise line of credit") and, in Texas and Ohio, Rise is available through a CSO program that provides consumers access to installment loans offered by a third-party lender ("Rise CSO").
Elastic—US bank-originated lines of credit
Elastic, currently available in 40 US states, is a line of credit designed to be a financial safety net for non-prime consumers. It is originated by a third-party lender, Republic Bank. See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Components of our Results of Operations—Revenues.” Elastic offers a maximum credit limit of $3,500 and charges an initial advance fee of $5 for each $100 advanced against the credit line, as well as a fixed charge of approximately 5% of open balances each payment period. Elastic’s effective APR based on this was approximately 97% for the year ended December 31, 2017, more than 75% lower than the average effective rate of a typical payday loan, based on the above-mentioned findings by the CFPB. There are no origination fees, monthly fees, late fees, over-limit fees or fees for returned payments on the product. Additionally, consumers must make a 10% mandatory principal reduction each month designed to encourage the full repayment of the original loan amount in approximately ten months or less.
Under the terms of our agreement with Republic Bank, we provide them with marketing services related to the Elastic program and license them our website, technology platform and proprietary credit and fraud scoring models to originate and service Elastic customers. However, as the originator of the Elastic lines of credit, Republic Bank reviews and approves all marketing materials and campaigns and determines the underwriting strategies and score cutoffs used in processing applications. In addition, Republic Bank defines all program parameters and provides full compliance oversight over all aspects of the program. Our platform supports Republic Bank’s operational and compliance activities related to the Elastic program. See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Overview” regarding the structure of Elastic and how we recognize revenue associated with Elastic loans.
Sunny—UK installment loans
Sunny is our online UK installment loan product, currently offering loans of up to £2,500. Rates range from 10.5% per month to 24% per month.
After almost five years, we believe Sunny has become one of the top online, high-cost short-term loan products in the UK according to data provided by a credit reporting agency. Sunny is a differentiated offering based on a wider range of loan amounts, a no-fee guarantee, price promotions and more flexible repayment options than most other providers in the UK short-term lending market.
15

In 2017, Sunny helped over 79,000 new customers gain access to credit which we believe accounts for more than 20% of market share in the UK based on an analysis from a major UK credit bureau. This year was the first in which the Sunny business generated net income, with over $100 million in revenue. Sunny launched an integrated PR, Social and Content team that has delivered significant value. Facebook is the flagship social media channel for Sunny and has seen 135% Sunny community growth in 2017. We also launched two new channels (Pinterest and LinkedIn) and a digital magazine called “Good Vibes” which now accounts for 3% of all traffic to the Sunny website. Our increase in investment in and outputs from these channels has helped improve SEO, or "search engine optimization," visibility by four times between May 2017 and December 2017.
ADVANCED ANALYTICS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The non-prime lending challenge
Traditional underwriting requires manual review of physical documents and human credit decisions. This is inconvenient for customers and for lenders it is resource-intensive, time-consuming and can lead to inconsistent results. "Fintech" lenders have recently used Big Data techniques to revolutionize the offering of credit. Instant credit decisions and automated processes are increasingly the norm for innovative online lenders.
In non-prime consumer lending, however, the analytical challenges are significantly greater. Traditional credit scores like FICO are poorly correlated with risk for non-prime consumers. Whereas prime consumers have established positive credit histories with traditional credit products and very little derogatory information, non-prime consumers are more varied and difficult to underwrite since they may have significant derogatory credit history or no credit history at all. Because of the wider variety of credit backgrounds and higher credit risk, automated analytical techniques for underwriting non-prime consumers must be much more sophisticated.
We use our deep insights into non-prime consumers and extensive experience serving over 1.9 million customers with $5.2 billion in credit to develop differentiated analytical techniques and scores to better underwrite and price credit for the New Middle Class. This approach provides for extremely high levels of automation in the underwriting process and has been proven to be effective, resulting in stable credit performance for our predecessor products through the last decade's financial crisis and continued improvements since launching the current generation of products. See “—History of stable credit quality through the economic downturn.” Furthermore, we invest significant resources into the research and development of new data sources and new analytical techniques to continue to improve our capabilities.
DORA risk analytics infrastructure
Unlike prime lenders who can use off-the-shelf credit scores such as FICO or build custom scores with limited data fields, we believe that successfully underwriting non-prime consumers in an online environment requires access to a much wider variety of data including not only traditional credit attributes and application information, but also website behavior, internal information, bank account information, social media information, email and phone number information, among others. Because continued leadership in non-prime underwriting is essential to drive growth, support further rate reductions to customers, and manage losses, we have made substantial investments in our DORA risk analytics infrastructure and in the development of the latest generation of our underwriting scores and strategies. The DORA risk analytics infrastructure utilizes a massive (approximately 80 terabyte) Hadoop database composed of more than 10,000 potential data variables related to each of the more than 1.9 million customers we have served and the over 6.5 million applications that we have processed including performance data from our funded customers. Our team of more than 35 data scientists uses DORA to build and test scores and strategies across the entire underwriting process described below (see “—Segmentation strategies across the entire underwriting process”). DORA supports a variety of analytical techniques and model outputs from traditional multivariate regression to machine learning and artificial intelligence. We believe this Big Data approach and investment is foundational to our ongoing initiatives to improve underwriting and lower rates to our customers. 
16

Segmentation strategies across the entire underwriting process
Based on our extensive experience and track record in the industry, we have found that FICO and other monolithic credit scores are inadequate for the non-prime market. Instead, we have used our DORA risk analytics infrastructure to develop an array of proprietary scores and strategies using highly predictive data sources and advanced analytical techniques targeting unique customer segments and marketing channels as well as different fraud types. This analytical approach, while more complex than most prime underwriting approaches, allows us to serve an expanding set of non-prime consumer segments and marketing channels while maintaining stable credit quality and acceptable customer acquisition costs. We use this approach across the entire underwriting process for both new and former customers, as described in the following chart:
17

Segment specific credit scores
We use our proprietary DORA risk analytics infrastructure to build targeted credit scores for key customer segments and channels. Based on our segmentation model, we utilize highly predictive data (including nationwide credit reporting agencies (“NCRA”), non-prime bureau data, and wide-ranging alternative data sources, as well as internally collected proprietary customer credit performance history) and analytical techniques (including multivariate regression, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques) to achieve a high level of accuracy for our scores. For instance, for “prime-ish” consumers who have access to traditional credit sources but supplement them with non-prime credit, we use NCRA data extensively in our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models. For “challenged” consumers who have derogatory NCRA credit information and, as a result, non-prime credit data is more relevant, our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models leverage data provided by non-prime credit bureau sources like Clarity and Teletrack. For “credit invisibles” with limited or no credit history, we may utilize a host of alternative data sources, such as detailed bank account data as well as the duration for which an applicant has used the same mobile phone number or used an email address. Our definitions of our customer segments and the ways they affect our credit scoring models evolve over time.
We assess over 10,000 data inputs while developing our segmented credit models. We are focused on increasing the pace of our remodeling efforts using our DORA risk analytics infrastructure and plan to release updated proprietary credit scores on an approximately quarterly basis.
Targeted fraud scores
In addition to our segment-specific credit scores, we have developed targeted fraud scores for different types of fraud. For instance, we have found that first-party fraud (when the loan applicant provides correct identity information but has no intent of repaying the loan), third-party fraud (when the applicant has stolen someone else’s identity information) and bank account fraud (when the borrower intends to shut down his or her account shortly after receiving the proceeds from the loan) are fundamentally different and require unique analysis and risk management tools.
Our proprietary fraud scores are built from over 10,000 available data inputs from our DORA risk analytics infrastructure and make extensive use of non-linear (e.g., machine learning) analytical tools and techniques. Examples of data sources that we have found to be predictive in our fraud scores include IP address information, how applicants use our website (including pages viewed), and email and bank account information as well as identity information provided by third parties.
Affordability analysis and line offers
Although not currently required by US federal law, we proactively assess the affordability of our products for our customers. We use multiple approaches including debt to income, payment to income and full budgeting (required by UK regulations), based on third-party and self-reported information, and continue to evaluate the effectiveness of each approach. Where applicable, we integrate real-time bank account information into our affordability scores. Our affordability assessment impacts both the decision of whether to provide the loan, as well as the maximum amount to offer. We use an enhanced affordability analysis that integrates previous payment history to underwrite current customers seeking to refinance their loan and for former customers requesting additional credit.
Customer management
In addition to underwriting new customers, we have built scores and strategies for underwriting customers who have paid off their initial loan and are looking for a new loan, or for customers who may want to refinance their current loan, typically for a larger amount and a lower rate. These scores and strategies reassess the customer’s creditworthiness integrating their payment history on previous loans. Based on this information and revised affordability analysis, the customer is either offered a new maximum loan amount and APR or declined for additional credit.
18

Fully automated, near-instant credit decisions
Credit and fraud determinations are made in seconds and approximately 95% of loan applications for all products are fully automated with no manual review required, based on our proprietary credit and fraud scoring models and affordability assessments. Once approved, the customer is provided the loan amount and relevant terms of the credit being offered. Of the approximately 5% of loan applications requiring manual review, in the US, the majority require further documentation, which can be provided via scanning, fax, email or mail, others may have failed a fraud rule in the applicable underwriting methodology, and are managed based on the rule failed, and others are reviewed to address “know your customer” and/or OFAC requirements. In the UK, of the loan applications requiring manual review, the vast majority require further verifications or other forms of identification, while the remaining portion requires further review based on fraud alerts by an industry database of fraudulent consumer activity, known as CIFAS. We provide declined customers with the reasons for the decision as per regulatory requirements.
Elevate fraud detection agents manually review a limited number of applicants based on the results of the fraud scores and any discrepancies in the application data they provide (such as identity information prior to the funding of the loan). Fraud detection specialists generate and review intraday reports to identify cross-application fraud risk and use such reports to flag additional loan applications requiring review. Elevate fraud detection agents use sophisticated link analysis of application information to identify potentially fraudulent activity and pursue additional investigation if they suspect fraud.
History of stable credit quality through the economic downturn
We bring extensive experience in managing defaults through the most recent financial crisis. Including products that preceded our current generation of credit products, we have provided $5.2 billion in credit to 1.9 million non-prime consumers since 2002. As the following chart indicates, our management team delivered stable credit quality for our predecessor products through the last decade's financial crisis. The chart below also presents the levels of volatility experienced by the US credit card industry over the same period.

Additionally, research conducted by the credit bureau TransUnion indicates that non-prime personal loan portfolios show significantly less volatility due to recessionary factors than portfolios with higher credit quality customers. As shown in the following chart, according to TransUnion data, non-prime portfolios demonstrated approximately half of the charge-off rate volatility of Prime, Prime-Plus and Super Prime portfolios during the Great Recession between 2006 and 2011. We believe this indicates that patterns of credit charge-offs for non-prime consumers can be acyclical or counter-cyclical when compared to prime consumers in credit downturns. In a recession, banks and traditional prime credit providers often experience increases in credit charge-off rates and tighten standards, which reduces access to traditional credit and pushes certain consumers out of the market for bank credit. Conversely, with advanced underwriting, lenders serving non-prime consumers are able to maintain comparatively flat charge-off rates, in part, because of these new customers who are unable to avail themselves of the traditional credit market.

(1) | TransUnion data on 90 day delinquency rates of balances for different Vantage Score bands from the first quarter of 2005 through the first quarter of 2017. Volatility is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of Vantage Score bands from the first quarter of 2006 to the first quarter of 2017 by the average during the same period. Super prime includes those with credit scores ranging from 781 to 850, Prime plus from 721 to 780, Prime from 661 to 720, Near prime from 601 to 660 and Non-prime from 300 to 600.

Commitment to research and development
We have built a team of over 100 employees in our Risk Management department, 48 of which have advanced degrees including eight with PhDs. Our Advanced Analytics team is primarily focused on analysis of new (typically non-traditional) data sources and analytical techniques. We believe our commitment to research and development in risk analytics results in consistently improving capabilities, which give us an on-going competitive advantage in the market by allowing us to scale our business while providing savings back to our customers in the form of lower rates.

OUR SALES AND MARKETING CAPABILITIES
Multi-channel approach to customer acquisition
Online providers of non-prime credit generally rely on third-party lead generators for customer acquisition, which we believe limits growth and provides challenges to achieving cost and quality targets. In contrast, we rely primarily on direct marketing channels, which support improved CAC, faster growth and heightened brand awareness. The following chart shows the percentage of total customers attributable to each marketing channel for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Our multi-channel approach is demonstrated by the following:

Ø | Direct mail: More than 100 million pre-selected credit offers mailed during the year ended December 31, 2017;


Ø | TV and mass media: Both brand and direct response-oriented campaigns launched for Rise and Sunny;


Ø | Strategic partnerships: Multiple partnerships with large customer aggregators to drive traffic; and


Ø | Other digital campaigns: Social media platforms, including blogs and banner ads, among others.

Analytically-driven channel optimization
Each new marketing channel we introduce requires extensive testing and optimization before it can be scaled cost-effectively and requires significant on-going analytical support. For instance, we spent three years developing, testing, and optimizing our response and credit models for preapproved direct mail campaigns to achieve an acceptable CAC for this channel. As a result, direct mail is now our largest and most profitable marketing capability, and we continue to identify new analytical approaches that help expand the addressable market through the direct mail channel.
21

Similarly, we have been piloting and refining TV campaigns for the past two years in both the US and UK markets in order to achieve target CAC levels. Rigorous testing of different creative messages, spot durations, “day-parting” and “pulsing” marketing strategies, and network targeting strategies have achieved significant improvements in performance. Based on these improvements, we are now aggressively expanding TV advertising. We believe TV and other mass media channels are essential to achieve brand awareness and market leadership for our products.
We are currently conducting large-scale tests of new digital and social channels that are showing strong initial results. Digital pilots in programmatic display and Facebook audience targeting, including campaigns focusing on re-targeting strategies, have proven to generate meaningful lift in customer conversions and are expected to be integrated and scaled following the initial tests and refinements. Furthermore, digital campaigns based on geo-fencing technology that allow us to target ads and offers to consumers entering a brick-and-mortar payday loan or title loan location have shown early potential.
We expect to continue to expand growth in all of the above channels based on improved customer targeting analytics and increasingly sophisticated response models that allow us to enhance our marketing reach while maintaining our target CAC. Our dedicated channel management teams continually monitor and manage campaign effectiveness. We believe our investment in developing multiple customer acquisition channels provides a significant competitive advantage over other online non-prime lenders who rely primarily on lead generators.
Integrated channel management
In addition to optimizing the performance of each channel, we are increasingly using integrated channel management strategies to improve marketing impact and enhance brand-building. We have found that coordinating the timing of individual channel campaigns and leveraging creative across channels can accelerate growth at lower costs.
TV has become a key accelerator for integrated channel management. Because of the ability of TV advertising to help build trusted brands and expand customer awareness, we have invested extensively in TV campaigns in both the US (for Rise) and the UK (for Sunny). For the Rise campaign, we licensed the song Eye of the Tiger from Survivor (commonly recognized as the soundtrack for Rocky III). In the UK, we licensed the 1960’s song Sunny by Bobby Hebb. By using elements from the TV creative across other channels, we have increased the response from these other channels. In addition, we have learned to “pulse” our TV placements to coincide with large direct mail campaigns, which significantly improves customer acquisition results across both channels.
Strategic partner development
Rather than utilizing lead generators who are often accused of deceptive practices, we have focused on developing relationships through large strategic partnerships. A customer is referred to us through a strategic partner by clicking on a banner ad that takes them to the advertised product’s website. Large strategic partnerships with companies allow us to better control customer application quality and CAC. We have contractual relationships with such partners whereby we pay a fee per loan funded per application approved or per banner clicked through. Because the customer completes the loan application on our website, rather than on a lead generator’s site, we control the messaging received by the customer about our products. LendingTree and Quint are our two largest strategic partners in each of the US and UK, respectively. Fees paid to strategic partners do not comprise a material portion of our total expenses.
We expect our relationships with strategic partners to expand over time, and we will evaluate opportunities to enter into new partnerships with affiliates and retailers to potentially enable non-prime customers to purchase goods and services on credit. We also have the ability to make targeted offers with discounted rates to strategic partners who we believe have higher quality applicants.
Customer relationship optimization
Our sales and marketing efforts are not only focused on acquiring new customers. We also market to current and former customers for additional or improved offers of credit.
22

Based on rigorous creditworthiness and affordability analysis, we typically offer increased credit lines to former customers—often at lower rates. Also, subject to our usage caps, we may offer current customers the ability to refinance loans to receive additional funds (in the US). We use both email and text messaging campaigns to reach customers with additional credit offers.
We have witnessed strong repeat customer use of our products. Historically, more than 50% of Rise installment customers who repay their loan have taken out an additional loan, often at a lower rate. Because there is no additional CAC for originating those additional loans, these transactions are highly profitable and can support offering a lower APR for consumers.
History of strong growth in new customer acquisition volumes at or below target CAC
As a result of our unique marketing capabilities discussed above, we have shown significant growth in annual new customer acquisition volumes while managing our customer acquisition costs at or below our target level of $250-$300. As indicated by the chart below, we generated record new customer volumes in 2017 while maintaining CAC below our target.
OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND INFORMATION SECURITY
Underlying our innovative product features and scalable loan processing and servicing is our flexible IQ technology platform. In addition to a proven ability to scale, our IQ technology platform supports compliant application and loan processing and business controls. We have optimized the platform for mobile device access, utilize a cloud-based architecture for consumer-facing components of the website, and have created an industry-leading decision engine that enables our sophisticated scores and underwriting strategies and supports ongoing testing and optimization of them. Also, because we collect and store extensive amounts of consumer information, we have invested in best practice levels of information security.
23

Flexible and scalable IQ technology platform
We call our end-to-end loan origination, decisioning, loan management and servicing system the IQ technology platform. We believe it integrates the best available third party loan modules under our proprietary architecture. This has allowed us to rapidly launch new products, modify product functionality and ensure regulatory compliance. In fact, all three of our current generation of credit products were released in 2013, highlighting the flexibility and scalability of our technology.
Our IQ technology platform includes proprietary architecture and messaging that facilitates high-availability, scalability and flexibility for changing product features. It supports both open-end (lines of credit) products as well as closed-end (installment loans) and is easily configurable for new pricing and term structures, whether in response to regulatory changes or competitive opportunities. Currently, the IQ technology platform supports our US products, Rise and Elastic. We plan to migrate Sunny from its legacy technology platform to the IQ technology platform in the future as business needs dictate. The core functionality of the IQ technology platform is illustrated below.

Mobile-first approach to user interface development
Currently, approximately two-thirds of our customer interactions come from mobile rather than desktop devices. The customer-facing portions of our products for both desktop and mobile interfaces are designed with a focus on user-friendly design and cross-platform mobility.
24

Cloud-based Web-IQ front-end
We host our customer-facing IQ technology platform web pages, or "Web-IQ," in the cloud to support personalized URLs, rapid prototyping, and testing and optimization of user interfaces. Our Web-IQ front-end supports different user application flows for different customers depending on what channel they came through and how risky we believe they are. Web-IQ allows our marketing and user experience teams to rapidly test new application flows on small percentages of inbound traffic to determine the impact of such changes on loan conversion, underwriting accuracy, and customer satisfaction prior to full deployment.

Sophisticated decision engine
Our sophisticated analytics approach requires us to manage numerous credit and fraud scores and strategies for each of our products, customer segments and marketing channels. In addition, because of our commitment to innovation and research and development, we are regularly conducting testing of new scores, data providers and analytical techniques. This requires an extremely flexible yet compliant decision engine. Our decision engine is a key component of the IQ technology platform and allows our Risk Management team to rapidly implement tests that control and measure the performance of new scores, data providers and analytical techniques against the existing best versions of each. In particular, the decision engine can rapidly integrate with new data providers and test a randomly selected percentage of application traffic with new scores and track their performance against existing scores.
All aspects of our underwriting process are controlled through components of the IQ technology platform, from the credit and fraud scores to the various product affordability assessments, to the instant decisioning and credit assignment process and even including the fraud and verifications activities performed by fraud agents. In this manner we have enhanced automation and have instituted tight controls over the entire decisioning process.
Best practice approach to information security and system reliability
Because we store extensive amounts of public and non-public customer personally identifiable information (“PII”) we take our obligations to protect that information and avoid data breaches very seriously. PII in the IQ technology platform is encrypted and we conduct regular audits of our security protocols via third party intrusion detection and vulnerability scans and penetration testing. These activities are supplemented with real-time monitoring and alerting for potential intrusions.
We have fully redundant data centers in place to support all critical business functions. Disaster recovery and business continuity plans and tests have been completed, which help to ensure our ability to recover in the event of a disaster or other unforeseen event.
COMPETITIVE OVERVIEW
The competition in our market is composed of both legacy brick-and-mortar and online credit providers. We compete with providers that offer products in the following categories:

Ø | Non-prime installment loans


Ø | Non-prime credit cards


Ø | Pawn loans


Ø | Payday loans


Ø | Title loans


Ø | Rent to own

In addition, bank overdrafts often function as an expensive form of emergency credit. According to a 2008 study by the FDIC, bank overdraft fees can have an effective APR greater than 3,500%, depending upon the amount of the overdraft transaction and length of time to bring the account positive.
Most legacy non-prime lenders still operate primarily out of legacy brick-and-mortar locations and require extensive documentation and face-to-face interactions. With online and mobile-only products, Elevate eliminates the potential need for our customers to drive across town and stand in line to apply for credit. In fact, with our products, the credit determination is made in seconds and approximately 95% of loan applications are fully automated with no manual review required.
25

There are few providers attempting to deliver lower-cost, online non-prime credit products similar to ours. Although there are a number of technology-enabled financial services companies that target prime and near-prime customers, including LendingClub, Prosper and Avant, there are only a limited number of comparable online competitors in the non-prime lending space, such as LendUp and NetCredit in the US and Pounds-to-Pocket in the UK. We expect more entrants in this space as this market continues to develop. We also believe that it would require significant time and expense for other companies to build technological and analytical platforms similar to ours, which is geared towards serving non-prime consumers. While other lenders may use proprietary or off-the-shelf lending platforms to support their online lending operations, these typically are focused on specific product types, and this makes such platforms inflexible for the kind of product innovation that we have pursued. We are not aware of any off-the-shelf products that support the variety of non-prime products such as those supported by our IQ technology platform and DORA risk analytics infrastructure. Although technology generally can be reverse-engineered over time, we believe our IQ and DORA technology and analytics platforms provide a competitive advantage due to our lead time based on our long history of serving non-prime consumers with multiple credit products. Although TFI holds an undivided co-ownership interest in the IQ technology platform as it existed as of January 1, 2015, without use restrictions on competition or otherwise, we have made significant modifications and improvements to it over the past three years.
The online non-prime credit market in the US is extremely fragmented and most lenders source customers from lead generation companies, resulting in low brand recognition. Unlike these competitors, we have made a significant investment in establishing a direct-to-consumer, integrated multi-channel marketing capability using direct mail, TV, search engine marketing, and digital campaigns, which we believe creates a unique opportunity for Rise and Elastic to become dominant and trusted brands in this space.
In the UK, high-cost short-term credit ("HCSTC") products are established, but are highly regulated and scrutinized by consumer affairs champions and advocacy groups. In 2015, the FCA undertook an industry review and introduced a set of regulations including a price cap to ensure borrowers will never have to pay back more than double what they originally borrowed. As a result, the number of HCSTC providers has shrunk as many exited the market. In July 2017, the FCA reviewed the price-cap and concluded that the regulations have delivered “substantial benefit to consumers.” 
Facilitated by distinctive TV campaigns, Sunny has become one of the most well-known brands in the space and we believe that Sunny is currently the number one or number two lender in the HCSTC market based on our improved customer value proposition, analytics and outstanding customer service. The launch of an integrated PR, Social and Content team has also delivered significant value to our overall marketing impact. Facebook is the flagship Sunny social media channel and has seen 135% Sunny community growth in 2017. 
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
The online consumer loan products we currently offer are subject to a range of laws, regulations and standards that address consumer lending, credit services, consumer protections and reporting, information sharing, marketing, debt collection, data protection, state licensing and interest rate and term limitations, among other things.
All products are subject to supervision, regulation and / or enforcement by numerous regulatory bodies—from state regulators and attorneys general, federal regulators, like the CFPB, the FTC and in some cases the FDIC, and the FCA in the UK. Consistent with regulatory expectations, we have an extensive compliance program and internal controls. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not been examined by the CFPB or the FCA, but we have had numerous state examinations.

For a discussion of the risks related to our regulatory environment, see “Risk factors—Other Risks Related to Compliance and Regulation.”
26

US regulation
State and local regulation and licensing
Rise is regulated under a variety of enabling state statutes. The scope of state regulation, including permissible interest rates, fees and terms, varies from state to state. Some states require specific disclosures, mandate or prohibit certain terms and limit the maximum interest rate and fees that may be charged. Where licensing or registration is required, we and our lending partners are subject to extensive state rules, licensing and examination. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, refunds of excess charges, monetary penalties, revocation of required licenses, voiding of loans and other administrative enforcement actions. Rise is available in the following 17 states: Alabama, California, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. Rise may also be subject to additional municipal regulations and ordinances related to, for example, certain non-bank loan products and debt collection. The scope of municipal regulations and ordinances vary. Several state regulators have publicly expressed their intent to increase supervision and enforcement of consumer protection laws against supervised entities. For example, on January 25, 2018 in response to a perceived policy shift by the CFPB, the New York Department of Financial Services (“DFS”) issued a press release indicating that it will “continue to take the lead and take action to fill increasing number of regulatory voids created by the federal government.” Several states, including Maryland and Pennsylvania have formed consumer protection units to increase their focus on enforcement of consumer protection statutes. This could result in additional regulatory oversight and enforcement on our business. 
US federal regulation
Truth in Lending Act.    Both Rise, an installment loan and line of credit product, and Elastic, a bank-originated line of credit product, are subject to the federal Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) and its underlying regulations known as Regulation Z. TILA and Regulation Z require creditors to deliver disclosures to borrowers during the life cycle of a loan—at application, at account opening or at consummation and for open-end credit products, such as Elastic and Rise, periodically.
The disclosure rules differ depending upon whether the product is an open-end credit or closed-end credit. Under the appropriate disclosure rules, the originating creditor is required to provide borrowers with key information about the loan, including, for open-end credit, the annual percentage rate (if applicable), applicable finance charges, transaction and penalty fees, and, for closed-end loans, the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments, the number and amount of payments and payment due dates.
Regulation Z and TILA also provide consumers with substantive consumer protections. Specifically, pursuant to Regulation Z and TILA, loan products are subject to special rules for calculating annual percentage rates, advertising, and for open-end credit, rules for resolving billing errors.
Fair Credit Reporting Act.    We are also subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”) and similar state laws, as both a user of consumer reports and a furnisher of consumer credit information to credit reporting agencies. The FCRA and similar state laws regulate the use of consumer reports and reporting of information to credit reporting agencies. Specifically, the FCRA establishes requirements that apply to the use of “consumer reports” and similar data, including certain notifications to consumers, including when an adverse action, such as a loan declination, is based on information contained in a consumer report.
We only obtain and use consumer reports subject to the permissible purpose requirements under the FCRA. The FCRA permits us to share our experience information, information obtained from credit reporting agencies, and other customer information with affiliates. We comply with notice and opt out requirements for prescreen solicitations and for certain information sharing under the FCRA. We also have implemented an identity theft prevention program to fulfill the requirements of the Red Flags Regulations and Guidelines issued under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (the “FACT Act”).
In meeting our duties to furnish consumer credit information to consumer reporting agencies, we:

Ø | furnish consumer credit information pursuant to the METRO 2 guidelines;


Ø | establish and maintain procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the consumer credit information we report; and


Ø | establish and maintain procedures to conduct timely investigations of customer disputes (received directly from customers or through credit reporting agencies) regarding the consumer credit information we report to the consumer reporting agencies.

27

Equal Credit Opportunity Act.    The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the “ECOA”) generally prohibit creditors from discriminating against applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, age (provided the individual is of legal age to enter into a contract), religion, national origin, marital status, the fact that all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act. Regulation B, which implements ECOA, restricts creditors from requesting certain types of information from loan applicants and from using advertising or making statements that would discourage on a prohibited basis a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application.
In the underwriting of loans offered through our online platform, and with respect to all aspects of the credit transaction, we, our lending partners and marketing affiliates must comply with applicable provisions prohibiting discouragement and discrimination.
ECOA also requires creditors to provide consumers with timely notices of adverse action taken on credit applications or counteroffers. A prospective borrower applying for a loan but denied credit or offered a counteroffer is provided with an adverse action notice.
FTC Act and Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.    Both the FTC and CFPB regulate the advertising and marketing of financial products and services. The FTC is charged with preventing unfair or deceptive acts or practices and false or misleading advertisements, and the CFPB is charged with preventing unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices, all of which can erode consumer confidence. All marketing materials related to our products must also comply with the advertising requirements set forth in TILA.
Military Lending Act.    The Military Lending Act (“MLA”) restricts, among other things, the interest rate and other terms that can be offered to active military personnel and their dependents. The MLA caps the interest rate that may be offered to a covered borrower to a 36% military annual percentage rate (“MAPR”), which includes certain fees such as application fees, participation fees and fees for add-on products. Prior to a recent amendment of the rules under the MLA, the MLA applied only to certain short term loans. The rules amendment extends the 36% rate cap to most types of consumer credit. The MLA also requires certain disclosures and prohibits certain terms, such as mandatory arbitration if a dispute arises concerning the consumer credit product. The amended MLA rules became effective on October 1, 2015 and applies to transactions consummated or established after October 3, 2016 for all credit products subject to the rules except credit cards, which have a later operative date.

The MLA, as amended, covers the Elastic and Rise products and restricts our ability to offer our products to military personnel and their dependents. Failure to comply with the MLA may limit our ability to collect principal, interest, and fees from borrowers and may result in civil and criminal liability that could harm our business.
The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.    The federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (“SCRA”) and similar state laws apply to certain loans made to certain members of the US military, reservists and members of the National Guard and certain dependents. The SCRA limits the interest rate a creditor may charge or certain collection actions a creditor may take on certain loans while a servicemember is on military duty. We maintain policies and procedures to comply with SCRA.
The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.    The federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (“E-SIGN”) and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (“UETA”) authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures. E-SIGN and UETA require businesses that use electronic records or signatures in consumer transactions and provide required disclosures to consumers electronically, to obtain the consumer’s consent to receive information electronically. When a borrower is provided electronic disclosures, we obtain his or her consent to transact business electronically, to receive electronic disclosures and maintain electronic records in compliance with E-SIGN and UETA requirements. We also follow similar state e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made and certain steps be followed in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures.
Electronic Fund Transfer Act.    The Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 (“EFTA”) protects consumers engaging in electronic fund transfers. The EFTA is implemented through Regulation E, which includes an official staff commentary. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred rule-making authority under the EFTA from the Federal Reserve Board to the CFPB and, with respect to entities under its jurisdiction, granted authority to the CFPB to supervise and enforce compliance with EFTA and its implementing regulations. Borrowers of our products often choose to repay by electronic fund transfers and, accordingly, a written authorization, signed or similarly authenticated, may be required in connection with auto-pay features. Restrictions on how consumers choose to pay or how lenders comply with electronic fund transfers could impact our current business processes.
28

To the extent a borrower repays his or her payment obligation through electronic fund transfers, the EFTA and its implementing regulations apply. EFTA contains restrictions, requires disclosures and provides consumers certain rights relating to electronic fund transfers.
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.    The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the “FDCPA”) provides guidelines and limitations on the conduct of third-party debt collectors and debt buyers when collecting consumer debt. While the FDCPA generally does not apply to first-party creditors collecting their own debts or to servicers when collecting debts that were current when servicing began, we use the FDCPA as a guideline for all collections. We require all vendors and third parties that provide collection services on our behalf to comply with the FDCPA to the extent applicable. We also comply with state and local laws that apply to creditors and provide guidance and limitations similar to the FDCPA.
Unfair, Deceptive, Abusive Acts and Practices.    The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices (“UDAAPs”). The CFPB has found UDAAPs in most phases in the life cycle of a loan, including the marketing, collecting and reporting of loans. UDAAPs could involve omissions or misrepresentations of important information to consumers or practices that take advantages of vulnerable consumers, such as elderly or low-income consumers. All products and services provided by Elevate and its vendors in the US are subject to the prohibition on UDAAPs.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.    We are also subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and security of consumers’ nonpublic personal information. Under these laws, including the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and Regulation P promulgated thereunder, we must disclose our privacy policy and practices, including those policies relating to the sharing of nonpublic personal information with third parties. We may also be required to provide an opt-out to certain sharing. The GLBA and other laws also require us to safeguard personal information. The FTC regulates the safeguarding requirements of the GBLA for non-bank lenders through its Safeguard Rules.
Anti-money laundering and economic sanctions.    We and the originating lenders that we work with are also subject to certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act under which we must maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program covering certain of our business activities. In addition, the Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibits us from engaging in financial transactions with specially designated nationals.
Anticorruption.    We are also subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) which generally prohibits companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits.
Telephone Consumer Protection Act. We are also subject to the TCPA and the regulations of the FCC, which regulations include limitations on telemarketing calls, auto-dialed calls, prerecorded calls, text messages and unsolicited faxes.
Telemarketing Sales Rule. We are also subject to the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule promulgated pursuant to such Act, and similar state laws. The Telemarketing Sales Rule prohibits deceptive and abusive telemarketing acts or practices, such as calling before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., and requires telemarketers and sellers to make certain disclosures to consumers in every outbound call. Telemarketers are also required to comply with a company specific do-not-call framework, as well as with state and federal do-not-call registries. We have implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with the Telemarketing Sales Rule.
CAN-SPAM Act. We are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 and the FTC’s rules promulgated pursuant to such Act (together, “CAN-SPAM Act”), which establish requirements for certain “commercial messages” and “transactional or relationship messages.” For example, the CAN-SPAM Act prohibits the sending of messages that contain false, deceptive or misleading information. It also gives recipients the right to stop receiving commercial messages. We have implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act.
Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act and its implementing regulations (together, the “TCPA”) regulate the delivery of live and prerecorded telemarketing calls, non-marketing calls to cell phones through the use of an automated telephone dialing system, fax advertisements, and text messages. For example, under the TCPA, it is unlawful to make many of these types of communications without the prior consent of the recipient. The TCPA also established a federal do-not-call registry, with the Telemarketing Sales Rule, as noted above. We maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with the TCPA.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The CFPB, which regulates consumer financial products and services, including consumer loans that we offer, was created in July 2010 with the passage of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over certain providers of consumer financial products and services. 
The CFPB released its final “Payday, Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Lending Rule” (“Rule”) on October 5, 2017 which would require us to provide customers notice at least three days before a payment withdrawal attempt, as well as obtain new ACH authorization from a customer following two failed ACH attempts, among other requirements. The Rule became effective on January 16, 2018; the compliance date for the Rule is August 19, 2019. However, on January 16, 2018, the CFPB announced that it intends to reconsider the Rule in its current form. This announcement follows the December 2017 introduction in the House of Representatives of a resolution to disapprove of the Rule under the CRA. 
On July 28, 2016, the CFPB issued its outline of proposals under consideration for the regulation of debt collection by third-party debt collectors. At this time, the CFPB has not issued a proposed rule for the regulation of debt collection by third-party debt collectors. However, if a final rule is promulgated, Elevate will take the necessary steps to ensure that its management and oversight of third-party debt collectors is consistent with the rule. 
We also expect the CFPB to continue with its rulemaking regarding the Supervision of Larger Participants in Installment Loan and Vehicle Title Loan Markets, which will enable the CFPB to examine and supervise those markets.
We do not currently know the full extent of the final rules the CFPB will ultimately adopt, and thus, its impact on our activities is uncertain, however the final rules will likely impose limitations on certain loans and services we offer. We believe that the new rules will ultimately reduce potential consumer harm and allow responsible lenders to continue to serve the large and growing need for non-prime credit. As noted above, Republic Bank is supervised and examined by the FDIC. Furthermore, it is not clear whether and to what extent the FDIC, the CFPB, or both will have supervisory authority over Elevate, as a service provider to Republic Bank.
The Trump Administration has issued numerous executive orders aimed at reducing regulations. It is unclear whether these apply to the CFPB. Further, the CFPB is currently overseen by Acting Director Mick Mulvaney who has made organizational changes to the CFPB, is reviewing all operations of the CFPB and has issued or anticipates issuing Requests for Information (RFIs) on the following topics: CIDs, Use of Administrative Adjudications, Enforcement, Supervision, External Engagement, Complaint Reporting, Rulemaking Processes, Bureau Rules Not Under §1022(d) Assessment, Inherited Rules, Guidance and Implementation Support, Consumer Education and Consumer Inquiries. It is unclear what impact, if any, the findings or outcomes of the RFIs will have on the oversight of Elevate’s business.
On January 31, 2018, the D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, decided that the CFPB’s structure—featuring a single director whom the president may remove only for cause—was constitutional. It is not clear what impact this case will have on the oversight of Elevate’s business.
Federal Trade Commission
The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") enforces the safeguarding requirements of the GLBA against non-banks pursuant its authority to enforce Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. In addition, the FTC has a history of pursuing enforcement actions against non-bank lenders and online lead generators for alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the marketing or servicing of consumer credit products and services. Like the CFPB, the FTC may issue fines and corrective orders that could require us to make revisions to our existing business models. The FTC has jurisdiction over Elevate and its business practices.
Foreign regulation
United Kingdom
In the UK, we are subject to regulation by the FCA and must comply with the FCA’s rules and guidance set forth in the FCA Handbook, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”), the Consumer Credit Act 1974, as amended (the “CCA”) and Secondary legislation passed under the FSMA and the CCA, among other rules and regulations. We must also follow the responsible lending and arrears, default and recovery rules, which provide greater clarity for lenders as to business practices that the FCA believes constitute inappropriate lending.
30

UK regulation and authorization.    Our Sunny product is covered by the extensive regulatory regime promulgated under the FSMA and CCA. The regulatory regime requires firms undertaking consumer credit regulatory activities to be FCA authorized. Regulated businesses must hold FCA authorizations, pay annual fees, follow prescriptive rules on advertising, include minimum and prescribed disclosures within pre-contract, loan and post-contract arrears documentation, regularly report customer complaints information, and maintain robust systems and controls in relation to the conduct of regulated business, including when engaging third-party suppliers.
The UK regime includes an obligation to self-report breaches of the applicable laws and regulations, and the FCA has the power to order regulated firms to pay fines, undertake changes to business models, implement customer remediation programs compensating customers for historic breaches and, among various other enforcement powers, limit or revoke regulatory authorizations. Failure to comply with the technical requirements of CCA and underlying regulations can, among other penalties, render loan agreements unenforceable without a court order or preclude the charging of interest for the period of non-compliance. The courts also have wide powers to determine that a relationship between a lender and customers is unfair and impose equitable remedies in such circumstances.
Equality Act.    The Equality Act 2010 prohibits unlawful direct and indirect discrimination and harassment of applicants and customers when conducting lending services on the basis of nine protected characteristics: age; disability; gender reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; race; religion or belief; sex; and sexual orientation. These requirements apply to the advertising, underwriting and enforcing of Sunny loans and the handling of complaints regarding Sunny loans.
Marketing laws.    Marketing in all mediums, including television, radio and online, is subject to the detailed advertising rules for the consumer credit industry contained in part 3 of the FCA’s CONC rulebook as well as the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005. In particular, all advertisements must be clear, fair and not misleading and include representative cost information and illustrations where particular advertising jargon is included in the material. Certain marketing expressions are also prohibited.
The Advertising Standards Authority (the “ASA”) has also published specific codes for broadcast and non-broadcast advertising to which we must also adhere. Both the FCA and the ASA tightly monitor consumer credit advertising and regularly conduct industry audits of compliance standards. The ASA maintains a complaints framework and investigates legal, regulatory and code breaches raised by both consumers and competitors and publishes public adjudications, which can require firms to amend or completely remove advertisements. Misleading marketing can also constitute a criminal offense under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 and result in fines from the FCA.

Debt collection practices.    The CCA sets out a formulaic procedure for customers in arrears, applicable when levying default fees and when taking any other steps in relation to default. Firms are required to issue statutory notices in a prescribed format within specific timeframes and include self-help information sheets. Failure to comply has severe consequences, including restricting lender rights to enforce relevant loan agreements, charge interest or any levy applicable default fees. The FCA also expects firms that have failed to comply with these requirements to proactively undertake extensive remediation activities, issuing refunds to customers where appropriate, including in cases where customers have not raised a complaint directly. A number of leading banking groups in the UK have undertaken such remediation activities.
Part 7 of the FCA’s CONC rulebook also sets out detailed rules and guidance for dealing with customers in arrears or default when pursuing recovery. The rules prohibit threatening, aggressive and harassing debt collection communications and practices, impose obligations to treat customers in arrears with forbearance and govern conduct when interacting with debt management firms engaged to resolve over-indebtedness. There are also specific rules on the use of continuous payment authorities as a repayment method that limit the number of repayment attempts that can be initiated by lenders.
Privacy laws.    In the UK, we are currently subject to the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “DPA”) and are required to be fully registered as a data-controller under the DPA and comply with industry guidance published by the regulator, the Information Commissioner. On May 25, 2018 the DPA will be replaced with the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). The GDPR is designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens’ data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. The GDPR is more prescriptive than the existing regime and includes new obligations on businesses, for example, the appointment of a data protection officer, self-reporting of breaches, and obtaining express consent for data processing and providing more rights to individuals whose data is processed, including the “right to be forgotten,” by having such individuals’ records erased. Penalties for non-compliance under the GDPR are up to 4% of annual global turnover (a.k.a. total revenues) for the preceding year or €20 Million (whichever is greater).
31

There are also strict rules on the instigation of electronic communications such as email, text message and telephone calls under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, which impose consent rules regarding unsolicited direct marketing, as well as the monitoring of devices.
We are subject to laws limiting the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area to non-European Economic Area countries or territories.
Anti-money laundering.    We are subject to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Money Laundering Regulations 2007, which require the implementation of strict procedures for our business activities. The UK regime includes self-reporting suspicious activities, the appointment of a designated anti-money laundering officer with overall responsibility for the compliance of the business and employees. The legislation also includes several criminal offenses and can result in personal criminal liability.
Anti-bribery and corruption.    UK firms are subject to the Bribery Act 2010, which introduces a number of individual offenses relating to giving and receiving bribes and dealings with foreign public officials. Commercial organizations can be prosecuted for failure to implement adequate procedures to record, report and prevent bribery.
APR by geography
The table below presents the maximum APR allowed by state for states in which Rise is offered. Sunny is subject to a 24% monthly APR limit, which is nationwide in the UK. Elastic is a fee-based product without a periodic rate that requires the disclosure of an APR.

EMPLOYEES
We are committed to building and nurturing a distinctive corporate culture of innovation, excellence, collaboration and integrity. Our key company values based on how we expect ourselves to serve our customers, owners and each other are:

Ø | Think Big. We have always been an innovator in our industry. Ideas, both big and small, are our competitive advantage. We share a responsibility to think out of the box, challenge the status quo and embrace change. 


Ø | Raise the Bar. Excellence is not a skill. It is a habit—the gradual result of always striving to do better. As a company and as individuals we push ourselves to build on success, learn from failure and get better every day. 


Ø | Win Together. Our goals are too big to achieve as individuals. Collaboration is not a by-product of our work, it is the primary focus. It is also more fun. 


Ø | Do the Right Thing. Doing the right thing is not optional. We hold each other to the highest standards and earn our reputation every day. 

Our values are reinforced in all aspects of our employees’ relationship with our company, including during the recruiting process and the bi-annual reviews, and play a large role in the promotion process. In addition, each quarter, employees who best exemplify these values are nominated for “Smart Awards” and are selected and recognized at all-company Town Hall meetings.

Elevate was certified as a "Great Place to Work" in 2016 and again in 2017 based on a comparison of our employees' survey responses to responses of hundreds of other certified companies. We believe this reflects our commitment to build a strong and lasting company and corporate culture.
As of December 31, 2017, we had 615 full-time employees, including 170 in technology, 110 in risk management, 86 in loan operations and customer support, 16 in marketing and business development, 131 related to our UK operations and 102 in general and administrative functions. We also outsource certain functions, such as collections and customer service to increase efficiencies and scalability. We use an internal quality team to review and improve third-party performance.
OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Protecting our rights to our intellectual property is critical, as it enhances our ability to offer distinctive services and products to our customers, which differentiates us from our competitors. We rely on a combination of trademark laws and trade secret protections in the US and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect the intellectual property rights related to our proprietary analytics, predictive underwriting models and software systems. We have either registered trademarks and/or pending applications in the US for the marks Elevate, Rise, Elastic and Sunny. We also own European Community trademark registrations for the Sunny and Elastic marks. Our trademarks are materially important to us and we anticipate maintaining them and renewing them.
OUR HISTORY
We were created through the spin-off of the direct lending and branded product businesses of TFI. TFI was founded in 2001. Prior to the spin-off transaction, TFI had two discrete lines of business: (1) a direct lender and branded product provider to non-prime consumers; and (2) a licensor of its technology platform to third-party lenders. In order to allow each of these separate lines of business to focus on its relative strategic and operational strengths and future business plans, the board of directors of TFI decided to spin off its direct lending and branded products business into a separate company.
We were incorporated in Delaware on January 31, 2014 as a subsidiary of TFI, and we had no material assets or activities as a separate corporate entity until the spin-off occurred. On May 1, 2014, TFI contributed the assets and liabilities associated with its direct lending and branded products business to us, and distributed its interest in our Company to its stockholders, but retained the assets and liabilities associated with its licensed technology platform line of business. TFI’s retained business line entails providing marketing services to third-party lenders and licensing TFI’s technology platform to these lenders for marketing and licensing fees. TFI previously conducted its direct lending business through various legal entity subsidiaries, which were contributed to us in the spin-off transaction.
On April 11, 2017, we closed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of 12,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $6.50
per share to the public. In connection with the closing, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase in full for an
additional 1,860,000 shares. On April 6, 2017, our stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “ELVT.”
