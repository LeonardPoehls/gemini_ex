Our Company 
We are a specialty finance company created with the objective of achieving consistent risk-adjusted investment income.  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We were formed as a Maryland corporation on January 3, 2006, commenced operations in February 2006 and completed the initial public offering of our common stock in June 2009. We conduct all of our business through and hold all of our assets in CYS Investments, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
Investment Strategy 
We invest in Agency RMBS collateralized by fixed rate single-family residential mortgage loans (primarily 15 and 30 years), ARMs, which have coupon rates that reset monthly, or Hybrid ARMs, which have a coupon rate that is fixed for an initial period (typically three, five, seven or 10 years) and thereafter resets at regular intervals. In addition, our investment guidelines permit investments in collateralized mortgage obligations issued by a government agency or government-sponsored entity that are collateralized by Agency RMBS ("CMOs"), although we had no investments in CMOs as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. In addition, we invest in debt securities issued by the United States Department of the Treasury (the "U.S. Treasury") or a government-sponsored entity that are not backed by collateral but, in the case of government agencies, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government ("U.S. Treasuries"), and, in the case of government-sponsored entities, are backed by the integrity and creditworthiness of the issuer ("U.S. Agency Debentures"). 
We make investment decisions based on various factors, including, but not limited to, relative value, expected cash yield, supply and demand, costs of hedging, costs of financing, liquidity, expected future interest rate volatility and the overall shape of the U.S. Treasury and interest rate swap yield curves. We do not attribute any particular quantitative significance to any of these factors, and the weight given to these factors varies depending on market conditions and economic trends. We believe that this strategy enables us to pay dividends and manage our book value throughout changing interest rate and credit cycles, and provide attractive long-term returns to investors.

Our investment strategy is designed to: 

• | maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of Agency RMBS that generates risk-adjusted investment income;


• | manage financing, interest and prepayment rate risks;


• | capitalize on discrepancies in the relative valuations in the Agency RMBS market;


• | manage cash flow to provide for regular quarterly distributions to stockholders;


• | manage credit risk;


• | manage the impact that changing interest rates have on our net income and book value, or stockholders' equity;


• | invest opportunistically in assets within our investment guidelines;


• | maintain our qualification as a REIT; and


• | exempt us from the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act.

Our income is generated primarily from the difference, or net spread, between the interest income we earn on our investment portfolio and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities. We believe the most prudent approach to generating a positive net spread is to manage our liabilities to mitigate the interest rate risks of our investments. We seek to achieve this result by employing short-term financing for our Agency RMBS portfolio in combination with interest rate swaps and caps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the financing of our portfolio. In the future, we may employ other hedging techniques from time to time, including interest rate floors, collars and Eurodollar and U.S. Treasury futures, to protect against adverse interest rate movements.
Since our investments vary by interest rate, prepayment speed and maturity, the leverage or borrowings that we employ to fund our asset purchases cannot be precisely matched to the terms or performance of our assets. Based on our experience, because our assets are not match-funded, changes in interest rates may impact our net income and the market value of our assets. Our approach to managing our investment portfolio is to take a longer term view of assets and liabilities, such that our net income and mark-to-market valuations at the end of a financial reporting period will not significantly influence our strategy of maximizing cash distributions to stockholders and achieving capital appreciation over the long-term.
Investment Sourcing 
We source the majority of our investments through relationships with a large and diverse group of financial intermediaries, ranging from major commercial and investment banks to specialty investment dealers and brokerage firms. 
Investment Process
Management evaluates each of our investment opportunities based on its expected risk-adjusted investment income relative to the investment income available from other comparable investments. Management also evaluates new opportunities based on their relative expected returns compared to the securities held in our portfolio. The terms of any leverage available to us for use in funding an investment purchase are also taken into consideration, as are potential risks posed by illiquidity or correlations with other securities in our portfolio. 
The key steps of our investment process are: 

• | allocation of our capital to the attractive types of Agency RMBS;


• | review of our asset allocation plan for overall risk management and diversification;


• | research and selection of individual securities and financing strategies;


• | active portfolio monitoring within asset classes, together with ongoing risk management and periodic rebalancing, to maximize long-term income with capital stability; and


• | consideration of the impact on maintaining our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act.

Financing Strategy 
We employ leverage to finance a portion of our Agency RMBS portfolio and seek to increase potential returns to our stockholders. Our use of leverage may, however, have the effect of increasing losses when securities in our portfolio decline in value. Generally, we expect our leverage to be between five and ten times. Taking into account actions and guidance provided by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("The Fed") about the future path of the target federal funds rate ("Federal Funds Rate"), the Fed's goal of reducing asset purchases, the ongoing interest-rate volatility in the mortgage and bond markets, and prevailing global and U.S. economic market conditions, we currently expect our leverage to remain in the middle of this range. At December 31, 2016, our leverage ratio was approximately 7.06:1, up from 6.77:1 at December 31, 2015. We calculate our leverage by dividing our (i) borrowings under repurchase agreements ("repo borrowings") and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati ("FHLBC" and "FHLBC Advances") plus payable for securities purchased minus receivable for securities sold plus the net TBA Derivative positions by (ii) stockholders' equity,
We finance our Agency RMBS investments using repo borrowings with a diversified group of broker dealers and commercial and investment banks. Utilizing repo borrowings enables us to borrow against the value of our assets. Under repurchase agreements, we sell our assets to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same assets from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus an interest factor. As a borrower, we are subject to margin calls from counterparties if the value of the collateral that we have posted has declined below the amount financed, plus the applicable haircut, which may occur due to prepayments of the mortgages causing the face value of the mortgage pool provided as collateral to the counterparty to decline or when the value of the mortgage pool provided as collateral declines as a result of interest rate movements or spread widening. Currently, the percentage amounts by which the collateral value must exceed the amount borrowed, which we refer to as the "haircut", are between 2% and 7%. Our repo borrowings are accounted for as debt for purposes of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and are secured by the underlying assets. During the period of a repo borrowing, we are entitled to and receive the principal and interest payments on the related assets.
We maintain formal relationships with multiple counterparties that are generally broker dealers and commercial and investment banks for the purpose of obtaining financing on favorable terms and managing counterparty credit risk. As of December 31, 2016, we had agreements in place with 50 counterparties and had outstanding repo borrowings with 35 counterparties for an aggregate of approximately $9.7 billion, or approximately 77% of the fair value of our portfolio, and a weighted-average borrowing rate of 0.89%.
In March 2015, our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, CYS Insurance Services, LLC ("CYS Insurance"), was granted membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") system, specifically in the FHLBC. The 11 regional FHLBs provide short- and long-term secured loans, called "advances", to their members. FHLB members may use a variety of real estate related assets, including residential mortgage loans and Agency RMBS, as collateral for advances. Membership in the FHLBC obligated CYS Insurance to purchase FHLBC membership stock and activity stock, the latter being a percentage of the advances it obtained from the FHLBC. On January 12, 2016, the Federal Housing Finance Agency ("FHFA") issued a final rule (the "Final Rule") amending its regulations governing FHLB Membership criteria for captive insurance companies. The Final Rule defines "insurance company" to exclude "captive insurers". Under this Final Rule, which became effective on February 19, 2016, CYS Insurance's membership in the FHLBC must be terminated within one year of the effective date and it will not be permitted to secure any new advances. As a result, all FHLBC Advances are required to be repaid no later than February 19, 2017. The Company repaid all outstanding FHLBC Advances prior to September 30, 2016. CYS Insurance's membership in the FHLBC will terminate on February 19, 2017.
In the future, we may utilize other financing techniques, which may include, but will not necessarily be limited to, the issuance of common stock, secured or unsecured debt, or preferred stock.
Hedging Strategy 
We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with the financing of our investment portfolio. Our most common method of financing Agency RMBS is through repo borrowings, which generally have maturities between 30 and 90 days, but may be longer. The weighted-average life of the Agency RMBS we own is generally much longer than the maturities of our repo borrowings. The difference in maturities, in addition to prepayments, adjustable-rate features of ARMs and other potential changes in the timing and amount of cash flows, may create interest rate risk. We engage in hedging activities in an attempt to manage interest rate changes that might impair our ability to finance assets we own at favorable rates. We employ our hedging techniques as a means to attempt to protect the portfolio against declines in the market value of our assets that result from general trends in debt markets. Our hedging techniques have historically consisted of interest rate swaps (a contract exchanging a variable rate for a fixed rate, or vice versa), including cancelable interest rate swaps (swaps that may be canceled at one party's option before expiry), and interest rate caps (a contract protecting against a rise in interest rates above a fixed level). In the future, our hedging techniques will likely continue to consist of interest rate swaps, including cancelable interest rate swaps, and interest rate caps, but may also include interest rate floors (a contract 
4

protecting against a decline in interest rates below a fixed level), interest rate collars (a combination of caps and floors), and Eurodollar and U.S. Treasury futures.
We enter into interest rate swaps to offset the potential adverse effects of rising interest rates on certain repo borrowings. Our repo borrowings generally carry interest rates that correspond to the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") for the borrowing periods. Historically, we have sought to enter into interest rate swaps structured such that we receive payments based on a variable interest rate and make payments based on a fixed interest rate. The variable interest rate on which payments are received is calculated based on 3-Month LIBOR. Additionally, we have entered into interest rate caps structured such that we receive payments when interest rates exceed a contractual fixed interest rate. Our interest rate swaps and caps effectively "fix" or "cap" our borrowing costs to the extent of the corresponding notional amounts and maturity dates and are not held for speculative or trading purposes. As of December 31, 2016, the swap and cap notional was $9.0 billion and covered 92.3% of our repo borrowings, herein referred to as our "hedge ratio". As of December 31, 2015, the swap and cap notional was $10.5 billion and covered 94.3% of our repo borrowings and FHLBC Advances.
Our Portfolio 
We invest principally in Agency RMBS. Our current portfolio of Agency RMBS is backed by fixed-rate mortgages and Hybrid ARMs that typically have a fixed coupon for three, five, seven or ten years, and then pay an adjustable coupon that generally resets annually over a predetermined interest rate index. 
In addition to Agency RMBS, we invest in U.S. Treasuries. As of December 31, 2016, our Agency RMBS and U.S. Treasuries (collectively, "Debt Securities") portfolio consisted of the following: 

 | Face Value | | Fair Value* | | Weighted-Average
Asset Type | (in thousands) | | Cost/Face | | Fair Value/Face | | Yield(1) | Coupon | | CPR(2)
15-Year Fixed Rate | $ | 4,323,608 | | | $ | 4,443,735 | | $ | 103.00 | | $ | 102.78 | | 2.29 | % | | 3.05 | % | 12.4 | %

(1) | This is a weighted-average forward yield calculated based on the cost basis, coupon and CPR, or "Constant Prepayment Rate" of the securities in the Company's portfolio at December 31, 2016. Because the forward yield is based on a projected CPR and assumes no turnover in the securities in the Company's portfolio, the Company expects the yield it realizes after December 31, 2016 will vary from those in the table above.


(2) | CPR is a method of expressing the prepayment rate for a mortgage pool that assumes a constant fraction of the remaining principal is prepaid each month or year. Specifically, CPR reflects the annualized version of the prior three month prepayment rate for the securities in the portfolio at December 31, 2016. Securities with no prepayment history are excluded from this calculation. 


(3) | The weighted-average months to reset of our Hybrid ARM portfolio was 67.1 at December 31, 2016. "Months to reset" is the number of months remaining before the fixed-rate on a Hybrid ARM becomes a variable rate. At the end of the fixed-rate period, the variable rate will be determined by the margin and pre-specified caps of the ARM. After the fixed-rate period, 100% of the Hybrid ARMs in the portfolio reset annually. 

*    Includes TBA Derivatives comprised of forward purchase and sales with a net fair value of $(308.8) million at December 31, 2016.
Below is a summary of our Agency RMBS, as of December 31, 2016 by production year (i.e., year in which underlying mortgages were originated), which includes TBA forward settling transactions:

Underlying Mortgage Production Year | 2017 (1) | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 | 2010 | 2009 | Total

(1) | Consists of forward settling transactions that will be 2017 production when settled.

We also held $8.0 million of other investments as of December 31, 2016. Other investments are comprised of $3 thousand of FHLBC stock and $8.0 million representing our net investment in real estate assets at fair value, inclusive of $3.8 million of corresponding mortgage debt, as of December 31, 2016.

Risk Management Strategy
Our board of directors exercises its oversight of risk management primarily through meetings of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee") with management.  The Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of our overall risk governance structure, risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies, the nature and extent of risks we take and our capital, liquidity and financing activities.  The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of the quality and integrity of our financial reporting and internal controls over financial reporting, including independent auditor selection, evaluation and review, and oversight of the internal audit function (“Internal Audit”), which is outsourced to an independent third-party that reports directly to the Audit Committee.  Internal Audit is responsible for performing our internal audit activities, which includes assessing with management, and independently validating key controls over financial reporting.
As part of our risk management process, we actively manage the interest rate, liquidity, prepayment and counterparty risks associated with our Agency RMBS portfolio. This process includes monitoring various stress test scenarios on our portfolio. We seek to manage our interest rate risk exposure by entering into various derivative instruments in order to minimize our exposure to potential interest rate mismatches between the interest we earn on our investments and our borrowing costs. 
We seek to manage our liquidity risks by monitoring our liquidity position on a daily basis and maintaining a prudent level of leverage based on current market conditions and various other factors, including the health of the financial institutions that lend to us under our repurchase agreements. 
We seek to manage our counterparty risk by (i) diversifying our exposure across a broad number of counterparties, (ii) limiting our exposure to any one counterparty and (iii) monitoring the financial stability of our counterparties. 
Competition
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. In acquiring Agency RMBS, we compete with other mortgage REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, the Fed, other governmental entities or government-sponsored entities, commercial finance companies, and other entities. Competition for these assets may result in higher prices and lower yields on our assets. 
Employees
As of January 31, 2017, we had 17 employees.
