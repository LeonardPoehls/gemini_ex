Business of Issuer
 
We were an exploration stage company until May 2017, at which time we transitioned to a senior retirement solutions company focusing on senior housing and retirement services and products.
 
On January 20, 2008, the Company allowed its interest in the Sobeski Lake Gold Property Claims to expire. The Sobeski Lake Gold property consisted of three mineral claims located in the Red Lake Mining District, in the province of Ontario, Canada. We had originally acquired our interest in the property by making a cash payment of $3,500 on June 16, 2004 to Dan Patrie Exploration Ltd. the registered owners of the property.
 
On January 8, 2008, we acquired, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Dynamic Gravel Holdings Ltd., a 100% interest in two gravel claims called the Northern Gravel Claims and Super Mammoth Gravel Claims (together the “Super Mammoth Gravel Project”) situated on tidewater for $25,000. The Super Mammoth Gravel Project was acquired by way of a purchase agreement. Mr. Farshad Shirvani has been paid CDN$25,000.
 
On April 27, 2017, the Company dissolved its wholly owned subsidiary, Dynamic Gravel Holdings Ltd. as part of the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) dated April 4, 2017, between Tim Coupland and Brian Game, the Company’s former principal stockholders (the “Sellers”) and Hartford International Retirement Network, Inc. (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Sellers agreed to sell to the Buyer, and the Buyer agreed to purchase from Sellers, a total of 5,185,000 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Sellers (the “Purchase Shares”). The Purchase Shares represented approximately 52.1% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.
 
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Board appointed Lianyue Song, Aaron Schottelkorb and Fuming Lin to fill vacancies on the Company’s Board of Directors caused by resignations of Messer’s’ Coupland, Game and Burylo.
 
On May 11, 2017, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding for Senior Holiday Service Cooperation with Shanghai Qiao Garden International Travel Agency (“Travel Agent”), superseded by a Retirement Vacation Services Agreement executed by the parties on August 25, 2017 (collectively referred to as the “Agreement”). The Company is engaged in the business of providing hotel rooms at favorable rates to travelers to Los Angeles from China. The Company’s president is a principal owner and CEO of a brand-new hotel in Rosemead, California, and the Company is acting as its agent to procure business from Chinese tourists and business travelers. Under the Agreement with the Travel Agent, the Travel Agent has agreed to provide no less than 300 retirement vacation clients per year for a minimum hotel stay of 3,000 nights. The Agreement also provides for payment of a monthly service fee. The Agreement automatically renews on an annual basis unless otherwise terminated by either party in writing. This Agreement was terminated by the Company as of June 30, 2018 because of lack of any revenues relating to the Agreement.
 
In addition, the Company intends to provide management services to retirement homes, commercial properties and apartment buildings in the following China cities: Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hainan and Shenyang.
 
On May 18, 2017, the Company sold its Northern Gravel Claims and the Super Mammoth Gravel Claims for $1 to the Company’s former officer and a former director to focus its efforts on new business venture in senior retirement services and products in China.
 
The Senior Living Industry
 
On August 31, 2018, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary entered into an agreement with Shanghai Qiao Hong Real Estate, Ltd. (“SQHR”) to manage an apartment building owned by SQHR located in Pudong New Area District Shanghai, China. The apartment building has 130 one-bedroom apartments and caters to mostly men and women over the age of 50.
 
The Company intends to enter the business of owning, leasing and/or operating senior living residences that will provide seniors with supportive, home life setting with care and services, including activities of daily living, life enrichment and health and wellness.
 
The senior living industry encompasses a broad spectrum of senior living service and care options, which include independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing care. We intend to concentrate on the independent living services.
 

● | Independent living is designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers where they receive services such as housekeeping, meals and activities, but are not reliant on assistance with activities of daily living (for example, bathing, eating and dressing), although we may offer these services through contracts with third parties.

The Company’s operating philosophy is to provide services and care which meet the individual needs of its residents, and to enhance their physical and mental well-being, thereby allowing them to live longer and to “age in place.” These facilities will offer, on a 24-hour basis, personal, supportive and home health care services appropriate for their residents in a home-like setting, which allow residents to maintain their independence and quality of life. We predict that the average of the residents at the Company’s facilities will be between 55 and 70.
 
The Company’s primary focus will be in China, where is intends to grow and become a leader in assisted living facilities. The Company also will seek to develop or acquire facilities in other Southeast Asian countries. The Company believes that by concentrating or “clustering” its facilities in target areas with desirable demographics, it can increase the efficiency of its management resources and achieve broad economies of scale.
 
The long-term care industry encompasses a wide continuum of services and residential arrangements for elderly senior citizens. Skilled nursing facilities provide the highest level of care and are designed for elderly senior citizens who need chronic nursing and medical attention and are not able to live on their own. Further, skilled nursing facilities tend to be one of the most expensive alternatives while providing elderly senior citizens with limited independence and a diminished quality of life. On the other end of the continuum is home-based care, which typically is provided in an individual’s private residence. While this alternative allows the elderly individual to “age in place” in his or her home and, in certain instances, can provide most of the services available at a skilled nursing facility, it does not foster any sense of community or the ability to participate in group activities.
 
Assisted living facilities generally are designed to fill the gap in the middle of this continuum. Assisted living facilities have been described by the Assisted Living Federation of America (“ALFA”) as providing a special combination of housing and personal, supportive and home health care services designed to respond to the individual needs of those who need, or desire help with their activities of daily living, including personal care and household management. Services in an assisted living facility are generally available 24 hours a day to meet the scheduled and unscheduled needs of residents, thereby promoting maximum dignity and independence.
 
The assisted living industry is highly fragmented. However, the Company believes that substantial industry consolidation is underway. At present, the industry is characterized by participants who operate only a limited number of facilities and who frequently can offer only basic assistance with a limited number of activities of daily living. The Company intends to be characterized by the following: (i) the ability to offer premium accommodations and a comprehensive bundle of standard services for a single inclusive monthly fee; (ii) sophisticated, professional management structures and highly trained employees; (iii) a cost-efficient, user-specific prototype facility; and (iv) experience in providing home health care services.
 
The Company’s facilities will provide services and care which are designed to meet the individual needs of its residents, enhance their physical and mental well-being and promote a supportive, independent and home-like setting. Most of the Company’s facilities will be primarily designed as premium facilities at which residents receive a comprehensive, bundled package of standard services for a single monthly fee.
 
The Company will strive to combine in its facilities the best aspects of independent living with the protection and safety of assisted living, with trained staff members who provide 24-hour care and monitoring of every resident. The assisted living facilities will be designed and decorated to have a home-like atmosphere. Residents will be encouraged to furnish their rooms with personal items they have collected during their lifetime.
 
Our assisted living facilities differ from skilled nursing facilities in that our assisted living facilities will not provide the more extensive, and costly, nursing and medical care found in nursing homes. Assisted living facilities differ from continuing care retirement communities in that, among other things, residents of assisted living facilities are not obligated to purchase frequently expensive lifetime contracts for residential living and care.
 
The long-term care industry is highly competitive, and the Company expects that the assisted living business in particular will become more competitive in the future. The Company will compete with numerous other companies providing similar long-term care alternatives such as home health agencies, life care at home, community-based service programs, retirement communities and convalescent facilities. Nursing facilities that provide long-term care services are also a potential source of competition for the Company. Providers of assisted living communities compete for residents primarily on the basis of quality of care, price, reputation, physical appearance of the facilities, services offered, family preferences, physical referrals, and locations. Almost all of the Company’s competitors will be significantly larger than the Company and have, or may obtain, greater financial resources than those currently available to the Company.
