ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
GENERAL 

Business Development Corporation of America (“BDCA,” or the “Company,” which may also be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually hereafter, as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). 
We were incorporated in Maryland in May 2010 and commenced our initial public offering (the “IPO”) on January 25, 2011. As of December 31, 2016, we had issued 189.6 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $2.0 billion including the shares issued under our distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) and shares purchased by an affiliate of Benefit Street Partners L.L.C. (“BSP”). As of December 31, 2016, we had repurchased a cumulative 12.5 million shares of common stock through our share repurchase program for payments of $113.4 million. 
Effective November 1, 2016, we are externally managed by our investment adviser, BDCA Adviser, LLC (“BDCA Adviser” or the “Adviser”), a subsidiary of BSP, a leading credit-focused alternative asset management firm with approximately $20 billion of assets under management as of February 28, 2017. In addition, BSP provides us with administrative services under an administration agreement (“Administration Agreement”) with the Company. We believe we benefit from the significant investment platform, personnel, scale and resources of our Adviser and BSP. Our investment activities are managed by the Adviser, and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of the Adviser and its affiliates. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. See “Regulation” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations. 
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and to a lesser extent long-term capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in senior secured loans, and to a lesser extent, mezzanine loans, unsecured loans and equity of predominantly private U.S. middle-market companies. We define middle market companies as those with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of $10 million to $100 million, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies. We may also purchase interests in loans or corporate bonds through secondary market transactions. We expect that each investment generally will range between approximately 0.5% and 3.0% of our total assets. As of December 31, 2016, 79.0% of our portfolio was invested in senior secured loans. 
Senior secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated debt and equity in bankruptcy priority and are generally secured by liens on the operating assets of a borrower which may include inventory, receivables, plant, property and equipment. Mezzanine debt is subordinated to senior loans and is generally unsecured. We may also invest in the equity and junior debt tranches of collateralized loan obligation investment vehicles (“Collateralized Securities”). For a discussion of the risks inherent in our portfolio investments, please see the discussion under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors”.
We intend to co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive order we received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), with certain of our affiliates. See “Material Conflicts of Interests” below. We believe that such co-investments may afford us additional investment opportunities and an ability to achieve greater diversification.
As a BDC, we are generally required to invest at least 70% of our total assets primarily in securities of private and certain U.S. public companies (other than certain financial institutions), cash, cash equivalents and U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.
We are permitted to borrow money from time to time within the levels permitted by the 1940 Act (which generally allows us to incur leverage for up to one half of our assets). We have used, and expect to continue to use, our credit facilities and other borrowings, along with proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from private securities offerings to finance our investment objectives. See “Regulation” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations.

ABOUT OUR ADVISER AND BSP
BDCA Adviser is the investment adviser of BDCA. BDCA Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). BDCA Adviser is a subsidiary of BSP, which is also registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act.
BSP is a leading credit-focused alternative asset management firm with over $20 billion in assets under management. Established in 2008, the BSP platform manages funds for institutions and high-net-worth investors across various credit funds and complementary strategies including high yield, levered loans, private/opportunistic debt, liquid credit, structured credit and commercial real estate debt. These strategies complement each other as they all leverage the sourcing, analytical, compliance, and operational capabilities that encompass BSP’s robust platform. BSP has approximately 150 employees with over 90 investment professionals. BSP is in partnership with Providence Equity Partners L.L.C., a leading global private equity firm with a combined $50 billion in assets under management.
Our investment committee consists of Thomas Gahan, Chief Executive Officer of BSP, Michael Paasche, Senior Managing Director of BSP, and Blair D. Faulstich, Head of Private Debt Originations of BSP, each with over 20 years of experience in the financial services industry and substantial experience in originating, underwriting and structuring credit investments. 
MARKET OPPORTUNITY

We believe that there exists a unique opportunity for BDCs with experience in investing in middle market companies. In our view, middle market companies provide attractive current yields and significant downside protection.
Our current opportunity is highlighted by the following factors:

• | Large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek additional capital to support private investments. We believe there remains a large pool of uninvested private equity capital available to middle market companies. We expect that private equity firms will be active investors in middle market companies and that these private equity firms will seek to supplement their equity investments with senior secured and mezzanine debt and equity co-investments from other sources, such as us.


• | Consolidation among commercial banks has reduced their focus on middle market businesses. The commercial banks in the United States, which have traditionally been the primary source of capital to middle market companies, have experienced consolidation, loan losses, and stricter regulatory scrutiny, which has led to a significant tightening of credit standards and substantially reduced loan volume to the middle market. Many financial institutions that have historically loaned to middle market companies have failed or been acquired, and we believe that larger financial institutions are now more focused on syndicated lending to larger corporations and are allocating capital to business lines that generate fee income and involve less balance sheet risk. We believe this market dynamic provides us with numerous opportunities to originate new debt and equity investments in middle market companies.


• | Refinancing activities will provide continued opportunities to extend capital to middle market companies. A significant volume of senior secured and mezzanine debt is expected to come due over the next several years. As companies seek to refinance their debt, we believe this will create new financing opportunities for us.


• | Lower default rates and higher recovery rates in the middle market. Default rates remain relatively low, with generally higher recovery rates in the middle market. Middle market companies are generally over-equitized as compared to large cap companies.


• | Favorable Pricing Environment in the Loan Market. Lower valuation levels in certain situations, combined with reduced liquidity in the secondary loan market, have created opportunities to acquire relatively high yielding senior and subordinated debt, both secured and unsecured, at potentially attractive prices.

BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and to a lesser extent long-term capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in first and second lien senior secured debt investments and mezzanine debt issued by middle market companies. We have adopted the following business strategy to achieve our investment objectives:

• | Utilize the experience and expertise of the principals of our Adviser and BSP. Certain principals of our Adviser and BSP have a broad network of contacts with financial sponsors, commercial and investment banks and leaders within a number of industries that we believe will produce significant proprietary investment opportunities outside the normal banking auction process.


• | Focus on middle market companies with stable cash flow. We believe that the middle market is less competitive and this is one factor that allows us to negotiate favorable investment terms. Such favorable terms include higher debt yields, more significant covenant protection and greater equity participation than typical of transactions involving larger companies. We generally invest in established companies with positive cash flow. We believe these companies possess better risk-adjusted return profiles than newer companies that are building management expertise or in the early stages of building a revenue base. These middle market companies represent a significant portion of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investment to grow their businesses.


• | Employ disciplined underwriting policies and rigorous portfolio management. We employ an extensive underwriting process that includes a review of the investment memo, competitive position, financial performance and industry dynamics of each potential portfolio company. In addition, we perform substantial due diligence on potential investments, and seek to invest with management teams and/or private equity sponsors who have proven capabilities in building value. As part of the monitoring process for portfolio companies, our Adviser analyzes monthly (if available), quarterly, and annual financial statements versus the previous periods and year, reviews financial projections, and may perform other procedures including meeting with management, attending board meetings and reviewing compliance certificates and covenants.


• | Focus on long-term credit performance and principal protection. We structure our customized loan investments on a relatively conservative basis with high cash yields, security interests (preferably first lien) where possible, cash origination fees, and appropriate leverage levels. We seek strong deal protection for our customized debt investments, including default penalties, information rights, board observation rights, and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. We believe these protections will reduce our risk of capital loss.


• | Diversification. We seek to diversify our portfolio broadly among companies in a multitude of different industries, thereby reducing the concentration of credit risk in any one company or sector of the economy. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort.

DEAL ORIGINATION
Our Adviser and BSP have extensive relationships with private equity firms, competing lenders, loan syndication and trading desks, management teams, investment bankers, and other persons who we believe will continue to provide us with significant investment opportunities. We believe these relationships provide us with competitive advantages over other BDCs.
From time to time, we may receive referrals for new prospective investments from our portfolio companies as well as other participants in the capital markets.
INVESTMENT SELECTION
We strive to structure our debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral that we can reasonably obtain while seeking to achieve our expectations for total returns on investments. We seek to structure our debt investments so that they often are collateralized by a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company. We seek to tailor the terms of our debt investments to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that seeks to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. A substantial source of our return is monthly or quarterly cash interest that we collect on our debt investments.
Our investment philosophy and portfolio construction involves:

• | Company-specific research and analysis; and


• | An emphasis on capital preservation, low volatility, diversification and minimization of downside risk.

3

The foundation of our investment philosophy is intensive credit investment analysis. We follow a rigorous selection process based on:

• | A comprehensive analysis of company creditworthiness, including a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the company’s business;


• | An evaluation of the management team and support from equity investors;


• | An assessment of the competitive landscape;


• | An analysis of business strategy and long-term industry trends; and


• | An in-depth examination of capital structure, financial results and financial projections.

We seek to identify those companies exhibiting superior fundamental risk-return profiles with a particular focus on investments with the following characteristics:

• | Established companies with a history of positive and stable operating cash flows. We seek to invest in established companies with sound historical financial performance. We typically focus on companies with a history of profitability.


• | Ability to exert meaningful influence. We target investment opportunities in which we will be the lead investor where we can add value through active participation. Our focus is often on first lien investments.


• | Experienced management team. We will require that our portfolio companies have an experienced management team. We also seek to invest in companies that have a strong equity incentive program in place that properly aligns the interests of management with such company's investors.


• | Strong franchises and sustainable competitive advantages. We seek to invest in companies with proven products and/ or services and strong regional or national operations.


• | Diverse customer bases and product offerings. We seek to invest in companies with diverse customer bases and product offerings.

INTENSIVE CREDIT ANALYSIS/DUE DILIGENCE

The disciplined process through which we make investment decisions with respect to a customized financing transaction involves extensive research into the target company, its industry, its growth prospects and its ability to withstand adverse conditions. If the investment team responsible for the transaction determines that an investment opportunity should be pursued, we engage in an intensive due diligence process. Though each transaction involves a somewhat different approach, the regular due diligence steps generally to be undertaken may include:

• | Meeting with senior management to understand the business more fully and evaluate the ability of the senior management team;


• | Checking management backgrounds and references;


• | Performing a detailed review of financial performance, earnings and potential for earnings growth;


• | Commissioning a quality of earnings report;


• | Visiting the headquarters and conducting other on site diligence;


• | Contacting customers and vendors to assess both business prospects and industry practices;


• | Conducting a competitive analysis, and comparing the company to its main competitors;


• | Researching industry and relevant publications to understand industry wide growth trends;


• | Assessing asset value and the ability of physical infrastructure and information systems to handle anticipated growth;


• | Investigating legal risks and financial and accounting systems;


• | Engaging third party experts and consultants to assist in the due diligence process; and


• | Building detailed projected financial models with an emphasis on downside scenarios.

PORTFOLIO MONITORING
With respect to customized financing transactions, our Adviser monitors our portfolio companies to determine if each company is meeting its business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company.
4

We employ several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and value of our investments, which may include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | Assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants;


• | Regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;


• | Attendance at and participation in board meetings of the portfolio company (if available); and


• | Review of monthly (if available), quarterly, and annual financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company.

PORTFOLIO ASSET QUALITY
Our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser grades the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio debt investment relative to the inherent risk at the time the original debt investment was made (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors.

Loan Rating | Summary Description 
1 | Debt investment exceeding fundamental performance expectations and/or capital gain expected. Trends and risk factors since the time of investment are favorable. 
2 | Performing consistent with expectations and a full return of principal and interest expected. Trends and risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments are initially rated a “2”.
3 | Performing debt investment requiring closer monitoring. Trends and risk factors show some deterioration. 
4 | Underperforming debt investment. Some loss of interest or dividend expected, but still expecting a positive return on investment. Trends and risk factors are negative. 
5 | Underperforming debt investment with expected loss of interest and some principal. 

The weighted average risk ratings of our investments based on amortized cost were 2.18 and 2.19 as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had six portfolio companies, which represented eight portfolio investments, on non-accrual status with a total principal amount of $136.2 million, amortized cost of $127.6 million, and fair value of $51.2 million, which represented 5.0%, 5.1% and 2.1% of the investment portfolio total principal, amortized cost and fair value, respectively. We are currently evaluating potential value recovery alternatives for these investments. As of December 31, 2015, we had three portfolio companies, which represented three portfolio investments, on non-accrual status with a total principal amount of $51.9 million, amortized cost of $51.2 million, and fair value of $33.0 million which represented 2.0%, 2.1% and 1.4% of the investment portfolio total principal, amortized cost and fair value, respectively.
DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE
The Adviser, acting pursuant to delegated authority from, and under the oversight of our board of directors, assists the board of directors in its determination of the NAV of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities that are publicly-traded are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities that are not publicly-traded are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. In connection with that determination, our Adviser facilitates the preparation, through the use of independent valuation firms, portfolio company valuations using relevant inputs, including but not limited to indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts.
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance which clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. The guidance defines fair value as the price that 
5

would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:

• | Each portfolio company or investment will be valued by the Adviser, with assistance from one or more independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors;


• | The independent valuation firm(s) will conduct independent appraisals and make an independent assessment of the value of each investment; and


• | Our board of directors determines the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of our Adviser, independent valuation firm and the board of directors.


Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. Below is a description of factors that our board of directors may consider when valuing our debt and equity investments.
Securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. We may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is readily available according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) to determine the fair value of the security. If determined readily available, we use the quote obtained.
Investments without a readily determined market value are primarily valued using a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M&A comparables, and enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process.
For an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value, we measure the fair value of the investment predominately based on the net asset value per share of the investment fund if the net asset value of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies, as of our measurement date. 
For investments in Collateralized Securities, we model both the assets and liabilities of each Collateralized Securities’ capital structure. The model uses a waterfall engine to store the collateral data, generate collateral cash flows from the assets, and distribute the cash flows to the liability structure based on priority of payments. The waterfall cash flows are discounted using rates that incorporate risk factors such as default risk, recovery risk, prepayment risk, reinvestment risk, and interest rate risk, among others. In addition, we consider broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services as an input to determining fair value when available.
DETERMINATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH OFFERINGS
Although we are no longer offering shares of our common stock in a continuous offering, we may, from time to time, elect to issue shares of our common stock in private placements. We are prohibited under the 1940 Act from selling our shares of common stock at a public offering price, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, that is below our net 
6

asset value per share unless we obtain stockholder approval. In connection with any issuance of our common stock, our board of directors or a committee thereof will review the then current public offering price per share, if available, against the current estimated net asset value per share to ensure that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price which, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, was below our net asset value per share. If shares are to be sold at a price below our net asset value per share, then a majority of our directors who have no financial interest in the sale and a majority of such directors who are not interested persons of the Company have determined that any such sale would be in our best interests and those of our stockholders.

In reviewing our offering price in connection with any closing, the board of directors or a committee thereof will consider the following factors, among others, in making such determination:

• | the net asset value of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report we filed with the SEC;


• | our Adviser’s assessment of whether any material change in the net asset value of our common stock has occurred (including through the realization of net gains on the sale of our portfolio investments) from the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value to the period ending two days prior to the date of the closing on and sale of our common stock; and


• | the magnitude of the difference between the net asset value disclosed in the most recent periodic report we filed with the SEC and our Adviser’s assessment of any material change in the net asset value since the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value, and the offering price of the shares of our common stock at the date of closing.

Importantly, this determination requires that we calculate net asset value per share within 48 hours of each closing. In addition, it involves a determination by the board of directors or a committee thereof that we are not selling shares at a price which, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, is below the then current net asset value per share at the time at which the sale of shares is made. To the extent that there is even a remote possibility that we may issue shares of our common stock at a price which, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, is below the then current net asset value per share, the board of directors or a committee thereof will elect either to postpone the closing until such time that there is no longer the possibility of the occurrence of such event or to undertake to calculate our net asset value per share within 48 hours of the issuance of shares of our common stock in order to ensure that it will not be at a price which, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, is below our net asset value per share.
These processes and procedures are part of our compliance policies and procedures. Records will be made contemporaneously with all determinations described in this section and these records will be maintained with other records we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. 
LEVERAGE
We may use borrowed funds, known as “leverage,” to make investments and to attempt to increase returns to our stockholders by reducing our overall cost of capital. As a BDC, we are only allowed to employ leverage to the extent that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after giving effect to such leverage.
Wells Fargo Credit Facility
On July 24, 2012, we, through a wholly-owned special purpose financing subsidiary, BDCA Funding I, LLC (“Funding I”), entered into the Credit Facility with Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent, account bank and collateral custodian (the “Wells Fargo Credit Facility”). The Wells Fargo Credit Facility, which was subsequently amended on April 26, 2013, September 9, 2013, June 30, 2014, May 29, 2015 and November 4, 2015, provides for borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0 million on a committed basis, with a maturity of May 29, 2020.
The Wells Fargo Credit Facility is priced at one month maturity LIBOR, with no LIBOR floor, plus a spread ranging between 1.75% and 2.50% per annum, depending on the composition of the portfolio of loans owned by Funding I for the relevant period. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. Funding I is subject to a non-usage fee to the extent the aggregate principal amount available under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility has not been borrowed. The non-usage fee per annum for the first six months is 0.50%; thereafter, the non-usage fee per annum is 0.50% for the first 20% of the unused balance and 2.0% for the portion of the unused balance that exceeds 20%. 
Borrowings under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility are subject to compliance with a borrowing base, pursuant to which the amount of funds advanced to Funding I varies depending upon the types of loans in Funding I's portfolio. As of 
7

December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with regards to the Wells Fargo Credit Facility covenants. The Wells Fargo Credit Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part, subject to customary breakage costs.
The Wells Fargo Credit Facility contains customary default provisions for facilities of this type pursuant to which Wells Fargo may terminate our rights, obligations, power and authority, in its capacity as servicer of the portfolio assets under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility, including, but not limited to, non-performance of the Wells Fargo Credit Facility obligations, insolvency, defaults of certain financial covenants and other events with respect to us that may be adverse to Wells Fargo and the secured parties under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility.
In connection with the Wells Fargo Credit Facility, Funding I has made certain representations and warranties, is required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar facilities and is subject to certain customary events of default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, Wells Fargo may declare the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility immediately due and payable. During the continuation of an event of default, Funding I must pay interest at a default rate.
Borrowings of Funding I will be considered our borrowings for purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act applicable to BDCs.
The obligations of Funding I under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility are non-recourse to us.
As of December 31, 2016, we had $298.2 million outstanding under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility.
Deutsche Bank Credit Facility
On February 21, 2014, we, through a wholly-owned, consolidated special purpose financing subsidiary, BDCA 2L Funding I, LLC (“2L Funding I”), entered into the a credit facility with Deutsche Bank (the “Deutsche Bank Credit Facility”) as lender and as administrative agent and U.S. Bank as collateral agent and collateral custodian. The Deutsche Bank Credit Facility was amended on February 19, 2016 and was terminated in accordance with its terms on June 3, 2016.
The Deutsche Bank Credit Facility provided for borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $60.0 million with a term of 36 months. The Deutsche Bank Credit Facility was priced at LIBOR plus 4.25%, with no LIBOR floor. Prior to its termination, the Deutsche Bank Credit Facility was subject to a minimum utilization of 82.5% of the loan amount thereafter, measured quarterly. If the utilized portion of the loan amount was less than the foregoing thresholds, such shortfalls bore interest at LIBOR plus 4.25%. The Deutsche Bank Credit Facility provided for monthly interest payments for each drawn loan. 2L Funding I paid a structuring fee and incurred certain other customary costs and expenses in connection with obtaining the Deutsche Bank Credit Facility.
Citi Credit Facility
On June 27, 2014, we, through a wholly-owned, special purpose financing subsidiary, BDCA-CB Funding, LLC (“CB Funding”), entered into a credit facility with Citi (the “Citi Credit Facility”) as administrative agent and U.S. Bank as collateral agent, account bank and collateral custodian. The Citi Credit Facility, which was subsequently amended on October 14, 2015, provides for borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0 million on a committed basis, subject to the administrative agent’s right to approve the assets acquired by CB Funding and pledged as collateral under the Citi Credit Facility. The Citi Credit Facility has a maturity date of June 27, 2018. 
The Citi Credit Facility is priced at LIBOR, with no LIBOR floor, plus a spread of 1.70% per annum for the first twenty four months and 2.00% per annum thereafter. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. CB Funding is subject to a non- usage fee to the extent the aggregate principal amount available under the Citi Credit Facility has not been borrowed. Any amounts borrowed under the Citi Credit Facility along with any accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will mature, and will be due and payable, in three years.
Borrowings of CB Funding will be considered our borrowings for purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act applicable to business development companies.
The obligations of CB Funding under the Citi Credit Facility are non-recourse to us.
As of December 31, 2016, we had $286.0 million outstanding under the Citi Credit Facility.

UBS Credit Facility
On April 7, 2015, we, through a wholly-owned, special-purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, BDCA Helvetica Funding, Ltd. (“Helvetica Funding”) entered into a debt financing facility with UBS AG, London Branch (the “UBS Credit Facility”). Pursuant to the UBS Credit Facility, which was amended on July 10, 2015 and June 6, 2016, we have access to up to $232.5 million in available debt available to fund investments in new securities and for other general corporate purposes. The UBS Credit Facility has a maturity date of April 7, 2018. Pricing under the transaction is based on three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 4.05% per annum for the relevant period. 
As of December 31, 2016, we had $232.5 million outstanding under the UBS Credit Facility.
Unsecured Notes
On August 26, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement with the initial purchasers, relating to our sale of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% fixed rate senior notes due 2020 to the initial purchasers in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and for initial resale by the initial purchasers to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act (the “Unsecured Notes”). We relied upon these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the initial purchasers. The purchase agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by us. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities under the Securities Act. The Unsecured Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. The net proceeds from the sale of the Unsecured Notes were approximately $97.9 million, after deducting initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions of approximately $1.6 million payable by us and estimated offering expenses of approximately $0.5 million payable by us. 
The Unsecured Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of August 31, 2015, between us and the trustee. The Unsecured Notes will mature on September 1, 2020, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time, or from time to time, at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture. The Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.00% per year payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 2016. The Unsecured Notes will be our general unsecured obligations that rank senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Unsecured Notes. The Unsecured Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior liabilities that are not so subordinated, effectively junior to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities, including credit facilities held by our wholly owned, special purpose financing subsidiaries.
The Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to: (i) comply with the asset coverage requirements of Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act as in effect immediately prior to the issuance of the Unsecured Notes, whether or not we are subject to such provisions; (ii) provide financial information to the holders of the Unsecured Notes and the trustee if we are no longer subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (iii) maintain total unencumbered assets, as defined in the Indenture, of at least 175% of the aggregate principal amount of all of our and the our consolidated subsidiaries’ outstanding unsecured debt determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the Indenture.
As of December 31, 2016, we had $98.8 million outstanding under the Unsecured Notes.
We expect that in the future, we may use other sources of financing for our investments such as proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders or proceeds from private offerings. However, our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT
Pursuant to the Investment Advisory and Management Services Agreement, as amended (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”), our Adviser oversees the management of our activities and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to our portfolio. 
On July 19, 2016, American Realty Capital II Advisors, LLC, the former parent of the Adviser, entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with a subsidiary of BSP, pursuant to which such subsidiary acquired all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of the Adviser (the “Transaction”). In connection with the Transaction, we amended the Investment Advisory Agreement, effective as of November 1, 2016, to allow the Adviser to serve as investment adviser to us following the closing of the Transaction.
Responsibilities of the Adviser 
Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, our Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services to us. Under the terms of our Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser, among other things:

• | Determines the composition and allocation of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes therein and the manner of implementing such changes;


• | Identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make;


• | Executes, monitors and services our investments;


• | Determines the securities and other assets that we will purchase, retain, or sell;


• | Performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; and


• | Provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds.

Our Adviser's services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and they are free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as their services to us are not impaired.
Compensation of the Adviser 
Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement and for the investment advisory and management services provided thereunder, we pay our Adviser a base management fee and an incentive fee.
Base Management Fee 
The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of our average gross assets. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears, and is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. All or any part of the base management fee not taken as to any quarter shall be deferred without interest and may be taken in such other quarter as the Adviser will determine. The base management fee for any partial month or quarter is appropriately pro-rated.
10

Incentive Fees 
The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is referred to as the incentive fee on income and it is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for the immediately preceding quarter. “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, other than fees for providing managerial assistance, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The payment of the incentive fee on income shall be subject to payment of a preferred return to investors each quarter, expressed as a quarterly rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 1.75% (7.00% annualized), subject to a “catch up” feature (as described below). The calculation of the incentive fee on income for each quarter is as follows:

• | No incentive fee on income shall be payable to the Adviser in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.75% or 7.00% annualized (the “Preferred Return”) on net assets;


• | 100% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized) shall be payable to the Adviser. This portion of our incentive fee on income is referred to as the “catch up” and is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income reaches 2.1875% (8.75% annualized) in any calendar quarter; and


• | For any quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.1875% (8.75% annualized), the incentive fee on income shall equal 20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, as the Preferred Return and catch-up will have been achieved.

The second part of the incentive fee, referred to as the “incentive fee on capital gains during operations,” shall be an incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments from the portfolio during operations prior to our liquidation and shall be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, if earlier). This fee shall equal 20.0% of our incentive fee capital gains, which shall equal our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees.
Payment of our expenses 

All investment professionals and staff of the Adviser and BSP, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services (including health insurance, 401(k) plan benefits, payroll taxes and other compensation related matters), are provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to: 

• | expenses deemed to be “organization and offering expenses” of the Company for purposes of Conduct Rule 2310(a)(12) of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA;


• | amounts paid to third parties for administrative services;


• | amounts paid to third party experts relating to the investigation and monitoring of our investments;


• | the cost of calculating our net asset value;


• | the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;


• | management and incentive fees payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement;


• | fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments (including third-party valuation firms);


• | transfer agent and custodial fees;


• | fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts (including attendance at investment conferences and similar events);


• | federal and state registration fees;


• | any exchange listing fees;

11


• | federal, state, and local taxes;


• | independent directors' fees and expenses;


• | brokerage commissions;


• | costs of proxy statements;


• | stockholders' reports and notices;


• | costs of preparing government filings, including periodic and current reports with the SEC;


• | fidelity bond, liability insurance and other insurance premiums;


• | printing and mailing; and


• | independent accountants and outside legal costs.

We reimburse the Adviser for all of our expenses incurred by the Adviser as well as the actual cost of goods and services used for or by us and obtained from entities not affiliated with the Adviser. The Adviser may be reimbursed for the administrative services performed by it on our behalf; provided, however, the reimbursement shall be an amount equal to the lower of the Adviser’s actual cost or the amount we would be required to pay third parties for the provision of comparable administrative services in the same geographic location; and provided, further, that such costs are reasonably allocated to the Company on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other method conforming with generally accepted accounting principles. No reimbursement shall be permitted for services for which the Adviser is entitled to compensation by way of a separate fee.
Duration and termination
In connection with the Transaction, we amended the Investment Advisory Agreement, effective as of November 1, 2016, to allow the Adviser to continue to serve as our investment adviser following the closing of the Transaction. Unless terminated earlier, it will remain in effect until November 2018 and then from year to year if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days' written notice to the other. Any termination by us must be authorized either by our board of directors or by vote of our stockholders.
ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENTS
On March 18, 2011, we entered into a fund administration servicing agreement and a fund accounting servicing agreement with U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC (the “Administrator”). Our Administrator provides the administrative services, such as accounting, financial reporting, legal and compliance support and investor relations support, necessary for us to operate. 
In connection with the closing of the Transaction, we terminated the prior Administration Agreement and entered into a new administration agreement with BSP on November 1, 2016 (the “New Administration Agreement”). In connection with the New Administration Agreement, BSP will provide us with office facilities and administrative services.
COMPLIANCE
We, along with our Adviser, have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the federal securities laws, and our board of directors is required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually to assess their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Guy Talarico, our Chief Compliance Officer, is the Chief Executive Officer of Alaric Compliance Services, LLC, and performs his functions as our Chief Compliance Officer under the terms of an agreement between BDCA and Alaric Compliance Services, LLC. 
12

COMPETITION
Our primary competition in providing financing for acquisitions, buyouts and recapitalizations of middle market companies will include other publicly-traded BDCs and public non-traded BDCs, public and private buyout and other private equity funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, hedge funds. Many of our competitors may be substantially larger and have considerably greater financial resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds as well as access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. We expect to use the industry expertise of the investment professionals to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we expect that our relationships will enable us to discover, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest.
STAFFING
We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees in the foreseeable future. The services necessary for the operation of our business are provided to us by our officers and the employees of our Adviser and BSP and our Administrator pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the servicing agreements that we have entered into with our Administrator.
REGULATION
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and the affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act also requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. The 1940 Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) 50% of our voting securities.
We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Business Development Companies - Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.” We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then current net asset value of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances.

The 1940 Act generally prohibits BDCs from making certain negotiated co-investments with affiliates absent an order from the SEC permitting the BDC to do so. Unless otherwise provided in the allocation policy, if an investment opportunity is appropriate for both us and other investment funds and the investment opportunity requires more than the price to be negotiated, the investment opportunity will be made available to the other investment fund or us on an alternating basis based on the date of closing of each such investment opportunity and each fund’s available capital. As a result, the Adviser and/or its affiliates may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and such other entities. Although the Adviser and its affiliates will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner and consistent with applicable allocation procedures, it is possible that, in the future, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in investments made by investment funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates.
The SEC staff has granted us relief sought in an exemptive application that expands our ability to co-invest in portfolio companies with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates (“Affiliated Funds”) in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the “Order”). Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) or our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the 
13

consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies.
As a BDC, we may be examined periodically by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. Our Adviser is a registered investment adviser and is also subject to examination by the SEC.
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
Asset Coverage
In addition, we are only allowed to borrow money such that our asset coverage, which, as defined in the 1940 Act, measures the ratio of total assets less total liabilities not represented by senior securities to total borrowings, equals at least 200% after such borrowing, with certain limited exceptions. We may use borrowed funds, known as “leverage,” to make investments and to attempt to increase returns to our stockholders by reducing our overall cost of capital. We currently have credit facilities with Wells Fargo, Citi, and UBS and have sold $100.0 million in aggregate principal of senior notes. For a detailed discussion of our current credit facilities, please refer to “Item 1. Business - Leverage”.
Qualifying assets
As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities of U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, U.S. operating companies with listed securities that have equity market capitalizations of less than $250 million, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.
14

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least
70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:
1.Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
a.is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;

b. | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and

c.satisfies any of the following:
i.does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;

ii. | has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million; 


iii. | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or


iv. | is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million.

2.Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.
3.Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
4.Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
5.Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
6.Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
Temporary investments

Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
15

Significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies
A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in “Regulation-Qualifying assets” above. BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Indebtedness and Senior Securities
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provision to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Business Development Companies - Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.”
The SEC has proposed a new rule under the 1940 Act that would govern financial commitment transactions (defined to include reverse repurchase agreements, short sale borrowings and any firm or standby commitment agreement or similar agreement) by BDCs. Under the proposed rule, a BDC would be required to comply with one of two alternative portfolio limitations, one of which would have the effect of treating such financial commitment transactions as senior securities. There are no assurances as to when the SEC will adopt a final version of the proposed rules or as to the form that the final rules will take.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements.
Our code of ethics is posted on our website at http://www.bdcofamerica.com and was filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the registration statement. You may read and copy the code of ethics at the SEC's Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. You may obtain copies of the code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC's Public Reference Section, Washington, D.C. 20549.
Election to be Taxed as a RIC
We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011, and intend to qualify annually thereafter as a RIC. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate- level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders from our taxable earnings and profits. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to obtain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss, (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). Even if we qualify as a RIC, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and could be subject to U.S. federal excise, state, local and foreign taxes.
16

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:

• | qualify to be treated as a BDC or be registered as a management investment company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;


• | meet the Annual Distribution Requirement;


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities or currencies. or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” as defined in the Code (the “90% Income Test”); and


• | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: (i) at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (which for these purposes includes the equity securities of a “qualified publicly traded partnership”); and (ii) no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. Government securities or securities of other RICs, (i) of one issuer (ii) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or the Diversification Tests.

Provided that we continue to qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (which generally is defined as net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) that we timely distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income of RICs unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of: (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year; (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year; and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.
We have also formed and expect to continue to form consolidated subsidiaries (the “Consolidated Holding Companies”). These Consolidated Holding Companies enable us to hold equity securities of portfolio companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code. See “Regulation” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations. 
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We delegate our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures that our Adviser follows are set forth below and are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by our Adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients.
Our Adviser will vote proxies relating to our securities in the best interest of its clients’ stockholders. It will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by its clients. Although our Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients’ portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.
The proxy voting decisions of our Adviser are made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of its clients’ investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, it will require that: (a) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to its chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (b) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
17

You may obtain information, without charge, regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Financial Officer, 9 West 57th Street, 49th Floor, Suite 4920, New York, NY 10019.
MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Investment Advisory Agreement

We entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement on November 1, 2016 under which the Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to us. The Adviser and its affiliates also provide investment advisory services to other funds that have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. The Adviser and its affiliates serve as investment adviser or subadvisor to private funds and registered open-end funds, and serves as an investment adviser to a public REIT. The Adviser’s policies are designed to manage and mitigate the conflicts of interest associated with the allocation of investment opportunities pursuant to the SEC exemptive order. See “Co-Investment Relief”. In addition, any affiliated fund currently formed or formed in the future and managed by the Adviser or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. However, in certain instances due to regulatory, tax, investment, or other restrictions, certain investment opportunities may not be appropriate for either us or other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates.
Administration Agreement
In connection with the closing of the Transaction, we terminated our previous administration agreement and entered into a new administration agreement with BSP on November 1, 2016. In connection with the New Administration Agreement, BSP will provide us with office facilities and administrative services.
Co-Investment Relief
The 1940 Act generally prohibits BDCs from making certain negotiated co-investments with affiliates absent an order from the SEC permitting the BDC to do so. Unless otherwise provided in the allocation policy, if an investment opportunity is appropriate for both us and other investment funds and the investment opportunity requires more than the price to be negotiated, the investment opportunity will be made available to the other investment fund or us on an alternating basis based on the date of closing of each such investment opportunity and each fund’s available capital. As a result, the Adviser and/or its affiliates may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and such other entities. Although the Adviser and its affiliates will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner and consistent with applicable allocation procedures, it is possible that, in the future, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in investments made by investment funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates.
The SEC staff has granted us relief sought in an exemptive application that expands our ability to co-invest in portfolio companies with other funds managed by the Adviser or its Affiliated Funds in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions. Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) or our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies.
Transactions with Affiliates
In connection with the closing of the Transaction, an affiliate of BSP purchased $10.0 million of our common stock based on our net asset value per share as of September 30, 2016 in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. On November 7, 2016, we issued approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock to the BSP affiliate.
