Item 1.    Business
Company Overview
 
We develop and sell computer software that provides secure information exchange, data transfer and sharing capabilities for enterprises and consumers. We have been in business for over twenty years and have sold our products to thousands of enterprises and more than one million individual consumers throughout the world.
 
Our primary business is selling and supporting managed file transfer, or MFT, software for enterprises. MFT software facilitates the transfer of data from one location to another across a computer network within a single enterprise or between multiple computer networks in multiple enterprises. The brand name of our MFT product platform is Enhanced File Transfer, or EFT.
 
We earn most of our revenue from the sale of EFT and products that are part of our EFT platform. We earn revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses, providing products under software-as-a-service, or SaaS, subscriptions, providing maintenance and support services, or M&S, and offering professional services for product configuration and integration.
 
We also sell other products that are synergistic to EFT including Mail Express, WAFS, and CuteFTP. Collectively, these products constituted less than 10% of our total revenue in 2016.
 
We focus on selling our EFT platform products in a business-to-business environment. We expect that the majority of the resources we will expend in the future for product research, development, marketing and sales will focus on our EFT platform products. We believe our products and business capabilities are well-positioned to compete effectively in the market for MFT products.
 
For a more comprehensive discussion of the products we sell and the services we offer, see Software Products and Services below.
 
We have won multiple awards for performance and reputation, including:

GlobalSCAPE was incorporated in Delaware in 1996.  Our address is 4500 Lockhill-Selma Road, Suite 150, San Antonio, Texas 78249. Our phone number is (210) 308-8267.
 
Industry Background
 
Communication across private and public computer networks that facilitates the movement and sharing of information between central and remote locations and with associates, employees, partners, suppliers, and customers is an integral part of daily operations for enterprises of all sizes. Corporate information managers must protect business assets, ensure that policies and processes meet regulations governing the management of sensitive information, and ensure that the right people have access to the right information, at the right place and at the right time. Global operations, diverse business partners and networks further emphasize the need for software applications that ensure compatibility, scalability, privacy, security and cost-effective integration. These requirements have created the need for maintaining the security of data and information in motion (for example, with traditional MFT solutions delivered as on-premises software or as a cloud service) and at rest (for example, through securely deleting or purging files or securely accessing stored data from mobile tablet or smartphone devices).
 
The increase in high-profile and large scale data breaches in corporate enterprises and government agencies involving access to information in an unauthorized manner have created a heightened awareness of the vulnerability of critical and confidential data. As a result, attention at an unprecedented level is being paid to the security and integrity of systems that store and transfer data electronically. In many cases, this emphasis involves assessing the adequacy of the security, reliability and visibility provided by existing MFT systems.
 
8
 


The need for secure MFT solutions is particularly strong for organizations faced with a daunting array of privacy, security, and remote accessibility challenges stemming from various regulatory and business requirements for data privacy and confidentiality. Regulatory and privacy requirements include federal legislation and regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA),the Federal Trade Commission Red Flags Rules, as well as state legislation and regulations in the U.S. such as California Senate Bill (SB) 1386 and the data security regulations issued by the Massachusetts Office of Consumer Affairs and Business, as well as the extraterritorial requirements such as the European Union Data Privacy Directive. Some of these statutes and regulations impose severe penalties for improper disclosure of confidential information.  Industry best-practices such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and self-imposed business requirements lead to the need to secure and protect consumer information, intellectual property and trade secrets. Use of secure MFT solutions offer protection against disclosure of proprietary information and also reduce corporate risks associated with the potentially devastating consequences of security breaches.
 
Our primary industry is known as managed file transfer. The MFT industry has its technical origin in the file transfer protocol, or FTP.  FTP dates back to 1980 (RFC 765, later superseded by RFC 959), with even earlier RFCs guiding prior attempts to establish standards for file transfer protocols. The use of file transfer protocols increased dramatically with the explosive growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web during the 1990s. The MFT industry arose from recognition that FTP alone does not provide adequate security and management capabilities for file transfers. MFT solutions offer a greater degree of security and control than FTP. Features available in MFT solutions include integrated security, auditing capabilities, performance monitoring, and reporting. The MFT industry includes low cost, or even free, solutions that offer basic capabilities. However, we believe businesses and even individuals require more advanced solutions that provide scalability, enhanced security options, automated workflow, dedicated maintenance and support, and other features that facilitate high-confidence, secure and cost effective file transfers.
 
Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned, released, and scaled to meet requirements.  We believe the continuing movement to cloud services is analogous to the telecommunications shift from dedicated point-to-point circuits to a delivery model in which the entire telecommunications infrastructure potentially can be used to establish, maintain, and manage individual connections on an as-needed basis.
 
Strategy
 
We intend to build upon our leadership position in the MFT market to provide businesses, other organizations, and individual users with the solutions necessary to meet their growing need for secure information exchange. From our perspective, fully addressing this need for secure information exchange requires consideration of capabilities beyond traditional MFT, including the sharing of content between both people and businesses, work group collaboration, access to content outside the data center, business-to-business partner enablement, electronic data interchange, integration between systems and information, solution-wide governance, and advanced visibility including analytics, dashboards, and transaction-level control. We intend to use our EFT platform as a foundation for expanding our product offerings into areas adjacent to MFT that are often addressed and managed by the same decision-makers who purchase our EFT platform. Going forward, we intend to focus on determining which areas of our business will contribute to our future growth in their current state, need additional investment to contribute in the desired manner or require further analysis to determine their place in our product offerings.
 
As we evolve our solution portfolio, we intend to maintain an appropriate balance between legacy and new solutions, including making choices about transitioning, sustaining, or retiring solutions as necessary to best operate under prevailing business conditions. Transitioning or sustaining solutions may involve consolidating capabilities within our solution portfolio, releasing upgrades in response to market or customer needs, or making bug fixes. We also may phase out solutions and earlier versions of our solutions periodically in accordance with our end-of-live, or EOL, policy.
 
In addition to expanding our products into areas adjacent to MFT, we also believe that we need to continue to expand the means of delivering our MFT products.  To that end, we intend to continue expanding our capability to deliver our MFT products through EFT Cloud Services which provides a flexible continuum of features and functions that gives the user the ability to pick and choose the extent to which they want to own or outsource the capabilities of our EFT platform. EFT Cloud Services also provides organizations the flexibility of deploying on-premises, in the cloud or in a hybrid cloud environment with all of the security, compliance, scalability, and visibility features of an on-premises managed file transfer solution. We continually evolve our strategic focus based on our vision for product innovation and development, our assessment of visibility of and demand for our products in the marketplace, and our evaluation of desired approaches for selling and delivering our products.  Our strategic focus consists of: 


9
 


 
· | Ongoing innovation of our EFT platform to address the expanding needs of our existing customers and to enhance our products’ appeal to new customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Licensing, developing and/or acquiring technologies with features and functions that are complementary to and synergistic with our EFT platform so as to expand the breadth of our products offerings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhancing our sales and marketing programs to improve identification of potential demand for our products and to increase the rate at which we are successful in selling our products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ongoing Innovation of Our EFT platform to Address the Expanding Needs of Our Existing Customers and to Enhance Our Products’ Appeal to New Customers.
 
We seek to continue to improve and enhance our core technology, primarily in the MFT space, in both breadth and depth.  By focusing on the breadth of the product, we seek to pursue different segments of the market to ensure that we have offerings that meet the needs of small and medium businesses, or SMBs, but also scale to meet the demands of larger enterprises.  This will require new features and packages to be released to these audiences.  We believe that increasing the depth of our products by adding new features will allow us to increase sales to our existing client base by helping them solve additional problems within their organizations.  Examples of innovation in our core technology for the 2016 fiscal year included EFT Workspaces, which permits end users to collaborate more effectively in a peer-to-peer relationship without having to rely on central administrators, and EFT Event Rule Enhancements, which expanded our capabilities with workflow optimization and enhanced automation.  We will continue to focus on our core technology to ensure its continued success.
 
Gartner Inc., a notable industry analyst, and International Data Corporation have stated that the annual MFT market is in excess of $700 million. We are a leader in MFT products and services. In 2015, 2013 and 2012, we achieved one of the highest ratings in the Managed File Transfer Vendor Landscape Report from Info-Tech Research Group by being designated a “Champion” in its Vendor Landscape report. Info-Tech Research Group evaluated criteria such as strategy, viability, sales and support reach, and channel partner programs. Its evaluation of our strategy garnered one of the highest possible scores due in part to our focus on security and regulatory compliance. Also playing a role in our rating was the assessment of EFT Enterprise, our primary MFT platform. EFT Enterprise was commended for its ability to meet advanced security requirements, its flexible deployment options and modular architecture. In addition, we also were positioned in the Leader’s quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Managed File Transfer in the latest years for which Gartner published this magic quadrant. We have since added adjacent-market capabilities, such as accelerated file transfer, business automation and business activity monitoring, to the EFT platform using our modular solution architecture. We believe that these capabilities are helping underpin the consistent growth in revenue from the EFT platform since they enable additional sales to existing clients and enhance the appeal of our software solutions to prospective, new clients.
 
With MFT capabilities increasingly being integrated into B2B gateways, data integration, service oriented architecture, and other technical solutions, we believe that the need to keep evolving our solutions and entering adjacent markets also is clear. We continue to believe the market will shift toward consideration of traditional MFT as more of a “feature” than a solution. This shift may take many years, but we believe early recognition of the trend and appropriate strategic planning increase our potential for evolving our solutions in front of the ongoing market changes. Placing our MFT offerings in a unified framework that provides comprehensive solutions to our clients’ information exchange requirements in a secure manner, while enabling users to perform their duties wherever and whenever needed, will be a key strategic element to further establish our market leadership in the broader markets. We believe key features such as collaboration, integration of disparate capabilities and systems into the MFT framework, and enhanced application support around the edge of MFT will increase client value and expand revenue opportunities.
 
Licensing, Developing and/or Acquiring Technologies With Features and Functions that are Complementary to and Synergistic with our EFT Platform so as to Expand the Breadth of Our Products Offerings.
 
The second area of strategic focus continues with product innovation but extends beyond pure MFT into adjacent segments and technologies.  We have made investments to integrate the capabilities of products and technologies such as Mail Express and scConnect into our EFT platform. We will continue to focus on determining which areas of our business will contribute to our future growth in their current state, need additional investment to contribute in the desired manner, or require further analysis to determine their future strategy.
 

10
 


Our solution portfolio may evolve over time, for example, through development of new offerings in adjacent markets or through acquisitions of technologies by licensing, partnering or by acquiring companies which own such technologies. We also maintain an active research and development program and work closely with partners and others in the industry to identify new solution opportunities. We also intend to remain alert for attractive opportunities to collaborate with others or perhaps combine other revenue-producing technologies with ours to expand our product offerings and reach.
 
We have allocated significant resources in recent years to enhancing our existing products and developing new solutions. This strategic focus has resulted in us adding features and functions to our EFT platform products and enhancing our ability to deliver those products to our customers in a variety of ways ranging from an on-premise, perpetual license to a full SaaS offering.
 
While storing and accessing data in a cloud environment is viable in many circumstances, we believe there also is a significant demand in the marketplace for the ability to access data in a manner similar to that offered by cloud computing but with the data being accessed and stored within the security of computers, servers or data centers owned by or dedicated solely to a particular individual or enterprise, rather than in the cloud. We believe our secure content mobility products potentially can provide or contribute to that functionality. Therefore, we intend to continue to expand and enhance these capabilities.
 
As we evolve our solution portfolio, we intend to maintain an appropriate balance between legacy and new solutions, including making choices about transitioning, sustaining, or retiring solutions as necessary to best operate under prevailing business conditions. Transitioning or sustaining solutions may involve consolidating capabilities within our solution portfolio, releasing upgrades in response to market or customer needs, making bug fixes, or phasing-out solutions periodically.
 
Enhancing our sales and marketing programs to improve identification of potential demand for our products and to increase the rate at which we are successful in selling our products.
 
We intend to sustain a high level of execution of our demand generation activities through our marketing group to provide a continuing flow of sales leads to our direct sales personnel and our channel sales partners.  We maintain lead generation programs that helped us to achieve the record revenues in 2016. During 2017, our sales and marketing efforts will continue to focus on enabling our channel partners and engaging their customers and prospects. We will continue to enhance our partner program to reward our partners who participate in our sales and technical certifications and drive new opportunities for us.  We believe that our marketing, sales and channel demand generation programs will continue to be a primary growth driver for GlobalSCAPE in 2017 and beyond.
 
We also intend to continue to emphasize ongoing initiatives to elevate our product and corporate profiles and awareness under the GlobalSCAPE brand. We believe that the transformation of our product lines into a more comprehensive solution architecture will continue to elevate this brand awareness with larger enterprises while still serving the needs of our traditional clients.  We will use internal resources as well as outside marketing and communications professionals to support this work.
 
We conduct business with thousands of organizations around the world. We provide solutions to some of the world’s largest manufacturers, distributors, banks, insurance companies, healthcare providers, automakers, film companies and technology providers. Given the breadth and depth of these market opportunities, we believe the effectiveness of a direct sales approach using only our in-house personnel to sell our products is limited by the number of qualified sales people we can hire and the number of prospective clients to whom they can present our products.  Accordingly, throughout 2016, we increased our emphasis on expanding our third-party sales channel relationships and intend to continue doing so for the foreseeable future.
 
We believe that utilizing and expanding our third-party sales channel relationships allows us to leverage the existing base of sales people in place in those companies and their existing customer relationships. In addition to exposing our products to hundreds, and potentially thousands, of sales people employed by those third-party resellers, our products can benefit from proven sales programs and methodologies in those organizations that are financed and supported by those selling partners.  We believe operating an aggressive channel reseller program provides an opportunity for our products to be presented to a notably larger number of potential buyers and in a more rapid fashion than if we attempted the same effort using only our direct salespersons.  We will continue to expand and enhance our existing channel relationships while at the same time identifying and engaging additional channel partners. Using this approach, we believe we can maintain and expand the exposure for our products in the marketplace in a manner that would probably take several years for us to accomplish on our own.
 

11
 


We believe this channel sales program helps us establish and maintain a lower-touch delivery model through which we train these partners to sell and distribute our solutions and provide them sales and marketing tools to support that effort. We utilize this approach to reduce our overall cost of marketing and selling our solutions in areas where it would be costly to establish a presence with our own employees. To facilitate this approach, we host channel partner conferences to provide a forum for exchanging ideas and delivering partner-specific sales education and training. Additionally, channel partners supplement our own demand generation efforts and provide access to client bases that previously would not have been available to us.
 
Software Products and Services
 
We develop and sell computer software that provides secure information exchange, file transfer and file sharing capabilities for enterprises and consumers. We have been in business for over twenty years and have sold our products to thousands of enterprises and more than one million individual consumers throughout the world.
 
Our primary business is selling and supporting MFT software for enterprises. MFT software facilitates the transfer of data from one location to another across a computer network within a single enterprise or between multiple computer networks in multiple enterprises. These transfers may be ongoing, repetitive activities executed by automated software routines that occur without human intervention, or they may be transfers that people create and complete in the absence of automated routines or as a result of ad-hoc, special situations that arise from time-to-time. Examples of enterprise-level activities that rely on MFT software include:
 
 
· | Transfer of transactional information within an enterprise on a repetitive basis from one geographic location to another, such as a transfer of deposit and withdrawal information throughout the day from a branch of a bank to a central data processing center at another location.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Movement of accumulated information within an enterprise from one data processing application to another on a periodic basis, such as a transfer of bi-weekly payroll information from a payroll system that is used to pay employees to a job cost system that is used to manage the cost of a project.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exchange of information between enterprises to facilitate the completion of one or more business transactions, such as a retailer transmitting inventory purchasing requirements produced by its material requirements planning system to an order entry system at a supplying vendor.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We have multiple revenue streams from our MFT products that include:
 
 
· | Perpetual software licenses under which customers install our products in their information systems environment on computers they manage and either own or otherwise procure from a cloud services provider, including deploying our products at a cloud services provider in a BYOL environment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cloud-based, hosted SaaS solutions that we sell on an ongoing subscription basis resulting in our earning a recurring, monthly subscription fee to access the service.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | M&S.
--+-----


· | Professional services for product installation, integration and training.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------



We also sell products that can be synergistic to our MFT products. These products have capabilities that:
 
 
· | Support information sharing and exchange capabilities using traditional email systems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enable enterprise file synchronization and sharing.
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | Enhance the ability to replicate, share and backup files within a wide area network or local area network, thereby allowing users to access their data at higher speeds than possible with most alternate approaches.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Support file transfers by individuals and small businesses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------



We earn most of our revenue from the sale of our MFT products that support business-to-business activities and are strategically focused on selling products in that environment. The majority of our resources that we will expend in the future for product research and development, marketing, and sales will concentrate on the MFT business-to-business market. We believe our products and business capabilities are well-positioned to compete effectively in that market.
 

12
 


Some of our products support consumer-oriented file transfers and file sharing. Even though these products are profitable on an overall basis, we anticipate the future resources we will expend related to products sold to consumers and the associated revenue we earn from those products will continue to be a minor part of our business.
 
The discussion following presents a summary description of our specific products and solutions.
 
Managed File Transfer – Enhanced File Transfer Platform
 
Enhanced File Transfer, or EFT, is the brand name of our core MFT product platform. EFT was awarded multiple industry awards in compliance categories in 2016 including the 2016 Golden Bridge awards, the Network Product Guide’s 2016 IT World Awards, and the 2016 Info Security Products Guide Global Excellence Awards.
 
The EFT platform provides users the ability to securely transmit data from one location to another using any number of files of any size or configuration. It facilitates management, monitoring, and reporting on file transfers and delivers advanced data transfer workflow capabilities to move data and information into, out of, and throughout an enterprise. Notable features and capabilities of the EFT platform include:
 
 
· | State-of-the-art, enterprise-level security when transferring information within or between computer networks as well as for collaboration with business partners, customers, and employees. EFT provides automation that supports effective integration of back-end systems. It has built-in regulatory compliance, governance, and visibility controls to provide a means of safely maintaining information. EFT offers a high level of performance and scalability to support operational efficiency and maintain business continuity. Administrative tools are provided at various levels of granularity to allow for complete control and monitoring of file transfer activities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transmission of critical information such as financial data, medical records, customer files, vendor files, personnel files, transaction activity, and other similar documents between diverse and geographically separated network infrastructures while supporting a range of information protection approaches to meet privacy and other security requirements. In addition to enabling the secure, flexible transmission of critical information using servers, desktop, and notebook computers and a wide range of network-enabled mobile devices, our products also provide customers with the ability to monitor and audit file transfer activities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Compliance with government regulations and industry standards relating to the protection of information while allowing users to reduce information systems and technologies costs, increase efficiency, track and audit transactions, and automate processes. Our solutions also provide data replication, acceleration of file transfer, sharing/collaboration, and continuous data backup and recovery to our customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The EFT platform provides a common, scalable MFT environment that accommodates a broad family of accompanying modules to provide enterprises with increased security, automation, and performance when compared to traditional FTP-based and e-mail delivery systems. Various, optional modules allow users to select the solution configuration most applicable to their requirements for auditing and reporting, encryption, ad hoc and web-based file transfers, operability in or through a DMZ network, and integration with back-end business processes, including workflow automation capabilities.
 
During 2015 and 2016, we released new versions of our EFT platform and new modules which added several enhancements and capabilities including:
 
 
· | Advanced Authentication Module (AAM) that increases the interoperability of EFT with multiple authentication methods. AAM provides a single source of authentication across a customer’s infrastructure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Workspaces, which is a file-sharing module that allows employees to create their own groups and assign permissions for those groups, much like a virtual data room, to provide access to files for which they themselves have access on the EFT server. This functionality is accomplished without compromising the security, control, and governance of those files. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A Workspaces Outlook plugin that provides secure ad hoc file transfers via email, providing customers with the reporting features in EFT and combining them with the simplicity and security of sending files with Mail Express. The integration of these two products takes the best features in Mail Express and incorporates them into EFT.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Accelerate, which is an accelerated file transfer module that boosts the speed and efficiency of secure data transfers and allows for the fast transfer of large files over disparate geographic distances.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



13
 


 
· | Enhanced compatibility of web transfer client file transfers through HTML5 support in addition to the existing Java Runtime Environment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increased scalability and business continuity with more flexible, uninterrupted file transfer service.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved facilitation of PCI DSS version 3.0 compliance with updates to security components, such as PGP and AS2.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhanced and expanded event rule functionality which improves the ability to integrate our products with client business processes and backend systems
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We expect to continue to enhance the EFT platform with capabilities that improve its speed and responsiveness of performance, provide additional administration flexibility supporting cross-platform implementation with our DMZ Gateway solution, offer business activity monitoring, and provide additional language support.
 
Most EFT customers choose to purchase a perpetual software license for a one-time fee paid at the time of purchase and under which they install the software on equipment they own and/or manage. In almost all cases, they also purchase ongoing M&S for which they pay us a recurring, annual amount that typically is 20% to 30% of the price of the software license.
 
If a customer prefers to use the capabilities of EFT in a SaaS fashion, we offer EFT Cloud Services for a monthly subscription fee. The EFT platform delivered in this manner has the same features and functionality as our EFT platform installed at a customer site. EFT Cloud Services allows users to reduce their upfront cost and achieve other recognized benefits of cloud-based managed file transfer SaaS subscription solutions, including strong service level agreements for information technologies infrastructure reliability and performance.  EFT can also be deployed for customers, on a BYOL basis, in their infrastructures running through Amazon Web Services or Microsoft AZURE. We have also initiated offering EFT Enterprise direct to buyers on a pre-deployed basis in the Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure Marketplaces.  
 
EFT Cloud Services provides a flexible continuum of features and functions that gives the user the ability to pick and choose the extent to which they want to own or outsource the capabilities of our EFT platform. EFT Cloud Services gives organizations the flexibility of deploying on-premises, in the cloud or in a hybrid cloud environment with all of the security, compliance, scalability, and visibility features of an on-premises managed file transfer solution. Users of EFT Cloud Services have the option to work with a variety of top hosting providers that best fit their needs. We offer flexible subscription pricing under one, two, and three-year contracts that can help our customers minimize or eliminate upfront capital expenditures and possibly reduce their ongoing operating costs. Subscription revenue from EFT Cloud Services is increasing but is not yet a material portion of the total revenue from our EFT platform.
 
Secure Information Sharing and Exchange Solution – Mail Express
 
Mail Express is a solution that provides secure information sharing and exchange capabilities leveraging traditional email workflow. It is a stand-alone product installed in a client-server environment that allows users to send and receive secure, encrypted e-mail and attachments of virtually unlimited size. Mail Express was a Bronze Winner in Email Security and Management by Network Products Guide’s 2016 IT World Awards.
 
To broaden the appeal and capabilities of Mail Express, we are developing functionality that integrates the features of Mail Express into the EFT platform. This integration will take the superior control, visibility and monitoring capabilities of the EFT platform and make them available to administrators and users in an email environment.  This integrated product will improve operational efficiency by providing a coordinated user interface through which data movement activities using both our EFT and Mail Express products can be managed.   Wide Area File Services Solution - WAFS
 
Our WAFS software product uses data synchronization to further enhance the ability to replicate, share and backup files within a wide area network or local area network, thereby allowing users to access their data at higher speeds than possible with most alternate approaches. The software uses byte-level differencing technology to update changes to files with minimal impact on network bandwidth while also ensuring that files are never overwritten, even if opened by other remote users. Other key features of WAFS include native file locking, replication to multiple locations simultaneously, adherence to access control list file permissions, and full UTF-8 support.
 
We will continue to offer WAFS as a stand-alone product and provide M&S services to customers who purchased WAFS in the past and who purchase it in the future. We do not expect to expend significant resources in the future expanding the features and capabilities of WAFS.

File Transfer Solution for Consumers - CuteFTP

CuteFTP is our original product introduced in 1996. It is a file transfer program generally used by individuals and small businesses. It remains popular today and generates incremental revenue for us at a relatively low cost.
 
CuteFTP continues to have significant brand recognition in the market.  Our current CuteFTP Version 9 introduced several notable new features including:
 
 
· | Support for Unicode (UTF-8) characters that allows greater international use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) support to facilitate collaboration between users in editing and managing documents and files stored on World Wide Web servers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 9 simplified our CuteFTP product line by consolidating all the features of our previous multi-product CuteFTP product line for Windows operating systems into this single version. We continue to offer CuteFTP Version 3.1 software for Mac platforms. We believe current versions of CuteFTP appeal to users wanting features more robust than offered in free alternatives such that it will be a product competitive in the marketplace for the foreseeable future.
 
We will continue selling CuteFTP as a stand-alone product and providing M&S services to customers who purchased CuteFTP in the past and who purchase it in the future. We do not expect to expend significant resources in the future expanding the features and capabilities of CuteFTP.
 
Professional Services
 
We offer a range of professional services to complement our on-premises and SaaS solutions. These professional services include product configuration and system integration, solution “quickstart” implementations, business process and workflow, policy development, education and training, and solution health checks. In addition, we may provide longer-term engineering services, including supporting multi-year contracts, if necessary, to support certain solution implementations and integrations. 
Maintenance and Support
 
We offer M&S contracts to licensees of all of our software products. These M&S contracts entitle the licensee to software upgrades and technical support services in accordance with the terms of our M&S contract.  Standard technical support services are provided via email and telephone during our regular business hours.  For certain of our products, we offer a Platinum M&S contract which provides access to emergency technical assistance 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.
 
Most of our M&S contracts are for one year although we also sell multi-year contracts. M&S is purchased by substantially all buyers of our EFT platform as well as by many customers who purchase our other products. Customers with M&S pay us a recurring, annual amount that is typically 20% to 30% of the software license price. A majority of our customers with M&S contracts renew them each year.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We emphasize developing our direct sales staff and reseller channel to capture sales through a high level of individual attention to the customer.  We provide our sales staff and resellers with training and professional development opportunities to ensure they are capable of meeting the needs of our prospects and customers. These sales team development activities focus on technical and process-oriented topical areas to enhance their ability to identify prospects, best position our solutions and develop pipeline opportunities into sales.
 
We believe our reseller and distributor channel relationships allow us to leverage those third-party resources to increase our market penetration. We have established such relationships throughout the world and across industry lines. In particular, we are focused on growing our domestic reseller channel.
 

15
 


Our marketing efforts focus on building brand awareness and capturing demand for our solutions. We take a two-pronged approach that includes a blend of digital and channel marketing. Through our digital marketing initiatives, we have invested heavily in content syndication programming, resulting in outbound targeted campaigns that more effectively reach the right audience with white papers, case studies and competitor comparisons. We also conduct ongoing search-engine optimization techniques and Pay Per Click advertising to enhance our ranking for particular key words in search results of major search engines. We continue to invest in channel marketing through programs designed to recruit and enable our target partners in a manner that creates joint initiatives that drive demand through them for our products. In addition, we are using our technology to meet the customer where they are shopping with placement in the Amazon Web Services and Azure marketplaces.
 
Our corporate website is www.globalscape.com . It provides a variety of sales and marketing information for our enterprise solutions as well as an ability to purchase some of our products online. We continually update the design of our websites to be responsive to the evolving marketplace and to provide a more solution-oriented perspective of our business, improve site navigation and provide additional opportunities for visitors to contact us through the websites.
 
Customers
 
We have sold our solutions throughout the world to individuals and enterprises ranging from SMBs to Fortune 100 companies. In order to leverage the resources of third parties, we make our products available for purchase by end users through third-party, channel resellers even though those end users can also purchase those products directly from us. During 2016 and 2015, we earned approximately 14% and 11%, respectively, of our revenue from such sales through our largest, third party, channel reseller. Although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on this distributor, if it were to experience a significant disruption of its business or if our relationship with them were to significantly deteriorate, it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be, at least temporarily, negatively impacted. We believe that such termination would not have a material adverse effect on us because we have engaged, or believe that we would be able to engage, alternative distributors, resellers and other distribution channels to deliver our products to end-customers shortly following the termination of any agreement with any distributor.
 
We derive a significant portion of our revenue from risk averse and/or regulated commercial customers in North America and throughout the world. Our primary commercial vertical markets include finance, health care, energy, retail, manufacturing, and engineering. We also have a customer base in the local, state, and federal government spaces. We continue to pursue additional government business by leveraging our certifications and industry validations.
 
Seasonality
 
Our products are marketed to individuals, SMBs and large organizations. As a result of this mix within our customer base, we typically have not experienced significant seasonality in our sales other than a typical modest decline from time-to-time in first quarter sales as compared to sales in the preceding fourth quarter. We believe this sales profile is related to our continued growth as an enterprise solution provider operating in an environment where first quarter sales possibly slow as prospective customers begin to execute their business activities, including purchases of our solutions, in accordance with new-year budgets and plans.
 
As a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives, we have historically received a substantial portion of orders from our customers and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each quarter. If a delay in an expected order for our products occurs near the end of a quarter that could result in revenue we expected to earn in that period to be delayed until a subsequent quarter.
 
Network and Equipment
 
We have contracted with various Tier 1 internet services providers.  Our arrangements provide for redundancy in the event of a failure and for expansion of available bandwidth in the event there is a dramatic increase in demand.  To protect critical customer data, our online shopping cart utilizes SSL encryption. We maintain technical and physical measures and procedures compliant with the PCI DSS. We use a certified Approved Scanning Vendor for security scans and PCI scan attestation.
 

16
 


We have dedicated servers on and off site and expansion plans in place to allow rapid and cost effective scalability.  Our offsite servers and data backup procedures provide a warm backup to our onsite servers for contingency purposes.  The backups are performed in accordance with our disaster recovery plan.
 
Research and Development
 
The technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware, operating systems and software. Our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve, as do their expectations of the performance of our software. To keep pace with these changes, we maintain an ongoing program of new product development to remain competitive and to address demands in the marketplace for our products.
 
Our internal software engineers are responsible for creating and building our software products. They do so by combining their expertise with input from our sales, marketing and product management groups as to market trends and needs. Our software engineers design and write software and manage its testing and quality assurance. We utilize third-party software developers both domestically and overseas working under our supervision to supplement our software engineers. Using these external software developers in a strategic manner allows us to access highly-skilled labor pools, maintain a 24-hour development schedule, decrease time to market, and minimize programming costs.
 
All phases of research and development, or R&D, including scope approval, functional and implementation design, object modeling and programming, are subject to extensive internal quality assurance testing.  We maintain an ongoing focus on improving our quality assurance testing infrastructure and practices. Technical reporting and customer support feedback from customers confirm the continuing positive effect of our ongoing enhancement of research and development and quality assurance processes.
 
Our R&D expenditures profile has been as follows ($ in thousands):
 

 | Year ending December 31, | 
-----------------------------+--------------------------+------
 | 2016 | | 2015 | 
R&D expenditures capitalized | $ | 1,538 | | $ | 1,967
R&D expenditures expensed | | 2,571 | | | 2,571
Total R&D expenditures | $ | 4,109 | | $ | 4,538

 
Total resources expended for R&D set forth above as total R&D expenditures serves to illustrate our total corporate efforts to improve our existing products and to develop new products regardless of whether our expenditures for those efforts were expensed or capitalized. Total resources expended for R&D is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for R&D expense (set forth above as R&D expenditures expensed) and capitalized software development costs (set forth above as R&D expenditures capitalized) individually. While we believe the non-GAAP, total resources expended for R&D amount provides useful supplemental information regarding our overall corporate product improvement and new product creation activities, there are limitations associated with the use of this non-GAAP measurement. Total resources expended for R&D is a non-GAAP measurement not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies since there is no standard for preparing this non-GAAP measurement. As a result, this non-GAAP measurement of total resources expended for R&D has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, R&D expense and capitalized software development costs individually.
 
Substantially all of our R&D expenditures relate to our EFT platform products with a relatively minor level of these expenditures being related to our other products. We expect to increase our research and development activities in future years as we focus on improving our current products and introduce new products.
 
Competition
 
The managed file transfer software market sector is highly competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of market participants.
 

17
 


The software industry has limited barriers to entry. The availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry. The software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of new competitors with innovative technologies. Competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve. In addition, some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share, any of which could harm our business. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Operations” for further discussion of risks regarding competition.
 
We believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to better serve customers by offering new products whether by internal development or acquisition. We also believe we must continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use, reliability, performance, range of useful features, continuing product enhancements, reputation, price and training.
 
There is limited information regarding the market shares of our solutions in their respective categories.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, personnel, and other resources, as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base than we do.  Significant competition characterizes the markets for our traditional MFT products. We anticipate we will continue to face increasing pricing pressures from competitors in the future. Given that there are low barriers to entry into the software market and that the market is subject to rapid technological change, we believe that competition will persist and intensify in the future.  For more discussion on the risks associated with our competition, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Operations”.
 
EFT Small Business (EFT SMB) Edition.  EFT SMB Edition competes against a number of secure, Windows-based FTP servers.  We believe our primary competitors are products sold by Ipswitch, Serv-U, and JSCAPE.  EFT SMB Edition has the advantage of leveraging the success of CuteFTP through product integration, offering proprietary extensions to the FTP protocol, and cross-marketing efforts to an existing customer base. EFT SMB Edition also benefits from being part of our EFT platform, which includes supplementary modules, including the DMZ Gateway solution, and an upgrade path to EFT Enterprise Edition.
 
EFT Enterprise Edition.  EFT Enterprise Edition competes in the managed file transfer market.  We believe our primary competitors are Axway, Ipswitch, IBM, and Linoma. EFT Enterprise Edition has the advantage of being cost effective in its market and allowing customers to flexibly evolve their MFT implementation by procuring supplementary modules such as our DMZ Gateway and Advanced Workflow Engine solutions.
 
CuteFTP.  CuteFTP exists in a highly competitive environment with numerous FTP software utilities available on the Internet for both the personal and professional user.  CuteFTP is positioned as one of the only secure FTP client programs that support a wide range of security standards related to the FTP protocol. We believe our primary competitors are consumer file transfer solutions sold by Ipswitch, Serv-U and Van Dyke Software, Inc.  CuteFTP was an early Windows-based FTP client to market and historically has been among the most frequently downloaded FTP clients on popular download sites.
 
WAFS.  WAFS competes in the wide area file services/storage market.  We believe our primary competitors are Panzura and Peer Sync, each of which is delivering proprietary appliances.  We believe that WAFS has the advantage of being a software-only solution which leverages corporate infrastructure and minimizes the total cost of ownership.
Mail Express.  Mail Express competes in areas of the file transfer market associated with e-mail attachment offloading.  We believe our primary competitors are Leapfile, Zix, and Biscom.  Mail Express has the advantage of centralized policies for outbound file attachments and a transparent end-user experience, which allows for rapid customer deployments. Mail Express also has the benefit of integration with our most recent EFT release which provides customers with a more uniform administration experience for e-mail attachment offloading and traditional MFT operations.
Cloud-based Solutions for Secure Information Exchange. Our EFT Cloud solutions compete with MFT SaaS solutions.  We believe our primary competitors are Ipswitch, IBM and Accellion.   EFT Cloud has the advantage of leveraging cost effective, secure hosting and cloud infrastructures, as well as management services provided by GlobalSCAPE experts.

Governmental Regulation
 
Export Control Regulations.  All of our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and applicable foreign government import, export and/or use requirements.   The level of control generally depends on the nature of the goods and services in question. For example, the level of control is impacted by the nature of the software and encryption incorporated into our products.  Where controls apply, the export of our products may require an export license or authorization or that the transaction qualifies for a license exception or the equivalent, and may also be subject to corresponding reporting requirements.  For the export of some of our products, we may be subject to various post-shipment reporting requirements.  Minimal U.S. export restrictions apply to all of our products, whether or not they perform encryption functions.   Additionally, because we are a Department of Defense contractor, there are certain registration requirements that may be triggered by our sales.  In addition, certain of our items and/or transactions may be subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) if our software or services are specifically designed or modified for defense purposes.  Companies engaged in manufacturing or exporting ITAR-controlled goods and services (even if these companies do not export such items) are required to register with the U.S. State Department.
 
Enhancements to existing products may, and new products will, be subject to review under the Export Administration Act to determine what export classification they will receive. In light of the ongoing discussions regarding anti-terrorism legislation in the U.S. Congress, there continues to be discussions regarding the correct level of export control. Export regulations may be modified at any time. Modifications to the export regulations could reduce or eliminate our ability to export some or all of our products from the U.S. without a license in the future, which could put us at a disadvantage in competing for international sales compared to companies located outside of the U.S. that would not be subject to these restrictions.  Modifications to the export regulations could prevent us from exporting our existing and future products in an unrestricted manner without a license or make it more difficult to receive the desired classification. If export regulations were to be modified in such a way, we may be put at a competitive disadvantage with respect to selling our products internationally.  We are working on enhancing our systems to address the impact of these regulations on our products and services and understand the need to comply.  We will complete technical reviews on any new products that we acquire or develop that may be subject to these regulations before we can export them.
 
Privacy Laws.  As our business evolves to incorporate more cloud and SaaS solutions, we will receive, transmit, and store a greater volume and diversity of information. As a result, we may be subject to various federal and State regulations regarding the protection of personally identifying information. Applicable laws may include, without limitation, federal laws such as the GLBA and HIPAA, as well as state laws, U.S. and state regulations, and international laws and regulations including the European Union Data Privacy Directive. In the event our systems are compromised by an unauthorized party, many of these privacy laws require that we provide notices to our customers whose personally identifiable data we reasonably believe may have been compromised. To mitigate the risk of compromised information, we use encryption and other security to protect our databases.
Intellectual Property
 
We regard some of the features of our internal operations, our software, our brands and marketing message, and our documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright, patent, and trademark and service mark laws and trade secret protection, such as confidentiality procedures, contractual arrangements, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary information. Our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products, services, and technology and enhance our competitive position and market value.
 
As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees and independent contractors, resellers, and corporate partners. We enter into license or subscription services agreements with respect to our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Our standard license agreements are transferable only in limited circumstances and have a perpetual term. Our subscription services agreements for our hosted and managed solutions restrict access and have a definite term. We also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities, equipment, and networks.
 
Our trademarks and copyrights are central to our business. We have the following trademarks in the United States:

In addition to the United States trademarks listed above, we have trademarks registered in Canada and the European Union for GlobalSCAPE. We have obtained United States copyright registrations for all but the most recent versions of our software applications.  We have two patents in the United States.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.  Policing unauthorized use of our products, which are licensed by the thousands and sold world-wide, is difficult.  While we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists, software piracy is a persistent problem.  In selling our products, we rely primarily on click-wrap licenses which are not signed in writing by licensees and may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions.  The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States.  Companies in the software industry, and other patent and trademark holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.  We have received, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of third parties, seeking damages resulting from such infringement or indicating that we may be required to obtain a license or royalty from such third parties.  For more discussion on the risks associated with our intellectual property, you should read the information under “Risk Factors,” especially “Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
