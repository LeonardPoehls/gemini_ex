    ITEM 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW.

1.
 Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business

The audited financial statements included herein have been prepared by MJ Biotech, Inc. (formerly Michael James Enterprises, Inc.) (the “Company”) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). We believe that all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the periods presented have been reflected herein and that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. 

We were a Company focused on developing intellectual property. We have, since the beginning of the third quarter of 2017, changed our focus toward Nutraceuticals. With this change in focus we entered into a “Binding Letter of Agreement” on July 26, 2017 to acquire ZEN HERO, Inc. d/b/a Zen’s Tea House “Zen”. The business of Zen is a formulator of organic teas and herbs (“Nutraceuticals”) for sale to the public and other businesses. Zen, currently works with doctors and other health professionals to develop teas and herbs to assist in the development of alternative solutions to the current medicines offered to patients and non-patients alike. 

Zen cannot make any health claims or state that green tea possesses specific health benefits. However, Zen can offer anecdotal literature and other information on diet and health benefits others have experienced and point people to ethically sound, licensed medical physicians who can offer medical advice, diagnosis, and treatment.
 Our goal is to help Zen create a well-known brand within the Nutraceutical market segment. To accomplish this goal, Zen is currently selling their teas and herbs through three main distribution networks.

The primary distribution source is via farmers markets. Zen currently operates in over 40 farmers markets per week. Farmers markets provide a valuable sales and distribution channel for the Zen’s products. Private markets are solitary events held by corporations for their employees as part of their health and wellness programs. Online sales are Zen’s main focus for growth through Zen’s website www.zenstea.com
Capital Needs

Our ability to implement this business model, develop, and market our products and services via Farmers Markets, Special Events and online with our ecommerce website is dependent upon our ability to raise sufficient capital. We have determined we need to raise approximately $1,500,000 for general operating capital, including funds necessary to hire and compensate executive and other employees, including staffing, support and equipment, advertising and marketing, expansion of business operations, and general working capital. Although we have received approximately $63,500 in promissory notes and $603,361 in convertible promissory notes during 2016 through 2017 we do not have any firm commitments to provide the balance of this capital and there are no assurances we will be successful in raising the necessary capital. In that event, our ability to fully implement our business model and begin generating revenues from our operations would be in jeopardy.
Competition

Most of Zen’s competitors online are well-established and have substantially greater financial resources than Zen does. Some of our online competitors are the “Full Leaf Company”, the “Republic Coffee and Tea Company” and “Adagio Teas”. Zen is currently working on increasing its online presence. Zen has little or no competitions in its current farmers markets and with the growth of the farmers markets segment across the nation this is an area Zen has the opportunity to expand.

Governmental regulation 

While there are currently relatively few laws or regulations directly applicable to Internet access, commerce, or commercial search activity, there is increasing awareness and concern regarding some uses of the Internet and other online services, leading federal, state, local, and international governments to consider adopting civil and criminal laws and regulations, amending existing laws and regulations, conducting investigations, or commencing litigation with respect to the Internet and other online services covering issues such as:
 ·
 user privacy;
 ·
 trespass;
 ·
 
5
 
defamation;
 ·
 database and data protection;
 ·
 limitations on the distribution of materials considered harmful to children;
 ·
 liability for misinformation provided over the web;
 ·
 user protection, pricing, taxation, and advertising restrictions (including, for example, limitation on the advertising on Internet gambling websites or of certain products);
 ·
 delivery of contextual advertisements via connected desktop software;
 ·
 intellectual property ownership and infringement, including liability for listing or linking to third-party websites that include materials infringing copyrights or other rights;
 ·
 distribution, characteristics, and quality of products and services; and

other consumer protection laws.

Legislation has also been introduced in the U.S. Congress and some state legislatures that is designed to regulate spyware, which does not have a precise definition, but which is often defined as software installed on consumers' computers without their informed consent and designed to gather and, in some cases, disseminate information about those consumers, including personally identifiable information. We do not expect to rely on spyware for any purpose, and it will not be part of our product offerings, but the definition of spyware or proposed legislation relating to spyware may be broadly defined or interpreted to include legitimate ad-serving software, including toolbar offerings and other downloadable software currently provided by our product offerings. Currently, legislation has focused on providing Internet users with notification of and the ability to consent or decline the installation of such software, but there can be no guarantee that future legislation will not provide more burdensome standards by which software can be downloaded onto consumers' computers. We expect that all downloadable software that we will distribute will require an express consent of the consumer and will provide consumers with an easy mechanism to delete the software once downloaded. However, if future legislation is adopted that makes the consent, notice, or uninstall procedures more onerous, we may have to develop new technology or methods to provide our services or discontinue those services in some jurisdictions or altogether. There is no guarantee we will be able to develop this new technology at all or in a timely fashion or on commercially reasonable terms. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations, application of existing laws to the Internet generally or our industry, or any governmental investigation or litigation related to the Internet generally, our industry, or our services may decrease the growth of the Internet or other online services. 


    Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we have 2 full time employees, and Company operations are being conducted at our corporate offices located in Cheyenne Wyoming 82001 at 109 East 17th Street, Suite 80.

   Our History

We were organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 30, 2010 under the name Spicy Gourmet International, Inc. as part of the implementation of the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization of Spicy Gourmet Organics, Inc. ("SGO"), a California corporation. SGO was incorporated in the State of California in 2006 and was formed to import specialty, organic spices from South Asia and sell them in the United States. SGO was undercapitalized and sales of its spice products were slow to develop, possibly due to the recession in the 2007-2008-time period. As a result, SGO lacked sufficient cash flow to meet its current obligations and on October 1, 2010 SGO filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. SGO's plan of reorganization was confirmed by the Court on November 19, 2010.

The plan of reorganization provided for the acquisition by SGO of a new, unrelated, retail business and the spin-off of all of the various elements of SGO's spice business to four different entities. The plan of reorganization called for the spin-off of SGO's manufacturing business to our company, the incorporation of our company, and the distribution of shares of our common stock to the bankruptcy creditors. The plan required us to issue 1,180,000 shares of our common stock and distribute these to SGO's general unsecured creditors, to its administrative creditors, and to its shareholders. The shares were distributed pursuant to Section 1145 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The Court also ordered the distribution of warrants to all administrative creditors of SGO, with these creditors to receive five warrants exercisable into shares of our common stock for each $0.05 of SGO's administrative debt which they held. All warrants were exercisable at any time prior to November 19, 2017. No Warrants were exercised prior to their expiration. 

We were a “shell company” as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933 from our date of incorporation until October 2012.

On October 20, 2012, we acquired from James M. Palladino, then an unrelated third party, the URL domain name and websites of bullsnbears.com for $150,000. Following this asset purchase we were no longer considered a “shell company.” On October 23, 2012, our former officers and directors resigned and certain of the then officers and directors were appointed, with the balance of our directors being newly appointed in December 2012.

In November 2012 we changed our name to BullsnBears.com, Inc. Effective December 11, 2015, we changed our name to Michael James Enterprises, Inc., and entered into an Agreement for Plan of Merger and Reorganization between the Company and Michael James Enterprises, Inc., a Nevada corporation. 

Prior to that, effective December 11, 2015, the Company filed an Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation changing the Company’s name to “Michael James Enterprises Inc.” and filed with FINRA for a new stock ticker symbol “MJTV”. 

On December 31, 2015, the Company formed a new wholly-owned company, BullsnBears Holdings, LLC., for the purpose of holding the Company’s intellectual property assets. As contractually agreed to, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, BullsnBears, Holdings LLC. was spun off in its entirety including all of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary including certain liabilities of the parent company that were incurred by the previous management including BullsnBears Holdings, LLC. Intellectual Property assets, including its websites, URL’s, and proprietary software, were transferred through a share dividend to MJTV shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 28, 2016, with one share of BullsnBears Holdings, LLC. Common Stock distributed for each one share of MJTV Common Stock owned as of the record date. Distribution of the shares took place on December 28, 2016.

On August 4, 2016, the company’s Board of Directors approved an asset purchase agreement with RP Capital Group, Ltd. to acquire all rights and title to the studies and intellectual property to a dronabinol based treatment for sleep apnea. This acquisition substituted the contemplated acquisition of Michael James Enterprises, Inc., a Nevada corporation which did not move forward as the acne-based product it was bringing to market has experienced several significant setbacks and the Board of Directors has determined that the proposed agreement was not in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. 

Since August of 2016 the Company created the alchemy of essential oils called LUNA to help a person relax and hopefully achieve better sleep. Additionally, the Company’s then CEO, James M. Farinella, designed a creative noninvasive delivery system for an active ingredient which was assigned to the company by the then CEO in exchange for 2,350,000 Preferred B shares. This product VOLUPTAS, now patent pending with a filing for a trademark on the Name VOLUPTAS. 

On December 28, 2016 The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, BullsnBears Holdings, Inc., was spun off spun-off through a share dividend to BNBI shareholders of record as of the close of business, with one share of BullsnBears Holdings Common Stock distributed for each one share of MJTV Common Stock owned as of the record date. Distribution of the shares is the responsibility of BullsnBears Holdings, Inc. and will take place upon the effectiveness of a Registration Statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

On April 12, 2017, the Company changes its name to MJ Biotech, Inc. to better represent the new direction of the Company. MJ Biotech has also changed its state of incorporation to the state of Wyoming. The change of domicile took place on August 25, 2017.
 On July 26, 2017, the Company entered into a “Binding Letter of Agreement” for the acquisition of ZEN HERO, Inc. d/b/a Zen’s Tea House. The business of ZEN HERO is a formulator of Organic Teas for sale to the public and other businesses. The transaction was anticipated to close within ninety (90) days of the execution of the Binding Letter of Agreement.  The proposed purchase price is a combination of cash ($750,000) and stock. $400,000 is payable on closing with the balance to be paid based on performance milestones. Zen Hero is a company that sells its own line of medicinal teas. Based on Un-Audited financial statements, Zen Hero generates more than $100,000 per month in sales and is profitable. The acquisition has not closed as of the date of this Report.  The Company is still working towards auditing Zen Hero’s financial statements in preparation to close on the acquisition into the Company as a wholly-owned subsidiary. There is no guarantee if, or when, this acquisition will be completed.  As of the date of this Report, neither party to the Binding Letter of Agreement has terminated the proposed acquisition.
