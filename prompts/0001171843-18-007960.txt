Item 1. Description of Business
General
 
Synthesis Energy Systems, Inc. (referred to herein as “we”, “us” and “our”), together with its wholly-owned and majority-owned controlled subsidiaries is a global clean energy company that owns proprietary technology, SES Gasification Technology (“SGT”), for the low-cost and environmentally responsible production of synthesis gas (referred to as the “syngas”). Syngas produced from SGT is a mixture of primarily hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane, and is used for the production of a wide variety of high-value clean energy and chemical products, such as substitute natural gas, power, methanol and fertilizer. Our current focus has been primarily on commercializing our technology outside China through the regional business platforms we have created with partners in Australia, Australian Future Energy Pty Ltd (“AFE”), and in Poland, SES EnCoal Energy sp. zo. o (“SEE”). Through AFE and SEE we believe we are developing energy and resource projects with the necessary commercial and financing structures to deliver attractive financial results. Our business model is to create value growth through AFE and SEE via the generation of earnings, from the licensing of our proprietary technology and the sale of proprietary equipment into those project developments, and through income from earned or carried equity ownership in resource and clean energy production facilities that utilize our technology. AFE and SEE endeavor to link long-term access to low-cost coal or renewable resources to the projects they develop as well as secure long-term contracts for product off-take thereby establishing the commercial and financing foundation for those projects.
 
Through AFE and SEE, we have established local expertise with knowledge of the markets and government influences in those regions and who have the expertise required for project development, project financing, and fundraising to deliver financial results for the platforms.
 
We believe our business proposition is compelling due to our ability to generate lower cost syngas in a clean and responsible manner utilizing coal, coal wastes, renewable biomass and municipal wastes for the production of clean energy and chemicals.
 
We operate our business from our headquarters located in Houston, Texas and our offices in Shanghai, China. Additionally, our partnership companies AFE and SEE have independent operations in Brisbane, Australia and Warsaw, Poland respectively.
 
Syngas as an Alternative to Conventional Energy Sources 
 
Our syngas can provide a competitive alternative to other forms of energy such as natural gas, LNG, crude oil and conventional utilization of coal in boilers for power generation. Such competing technologies include reforming of natural gas for chemicals and hydrogen production, oil refining for fuels production, petroleum byproducts for plastics, precursors such as olefins and conventional natural gas, fuel oil and coal combustion in power generation equipment and other industrial applications.

The competitive advantage of our syngas is primarily driven by the price and lack of availability of natural gas, LNG and crude oil. As such, our syngas can provide a lower cost energy source in markets where coal, low quality coal, coal wastes, biomass and municipal wastes are available and where natural gas, LNG and crude oil are expensive or constrained due to lack of infrastructure such as distribution pipelines and power transmission lines, such as Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of South America, while conversely in markets with relatively inexpensive natural gas, LNG and crude oil, we do not anticipate new syngas capacity additions.
 
In addition to economic advantages, we believe our syngas also provides an environmentally responsible option for manufacturing chemicals, hydrogen, industrial fuel gas and can provide a cleaner option for the generation of power from coal as it minimizes both air and solid environmental emissions, in addition to utilizing less water.
 
Target Markets 
 
World population is expected to increase by 1.7 billion reaching 9.2 billion by 2040 and global GDP is projected to average around 3.25% per year, broadly in line with growth over the past 25 years. The main driver of economic growth is increasing productivity which accounts for three-quarters of global expansion and lifts more than 2.5 billion people from low incomes. This places a large demand on energy. The stronger growth reflects the more limited scope for efficiency gains when oil, gas and coal used as a feedstock rather than as a source of energy, according to the BP Energy Outlook 2018 edition. While assessing target markets in relation to the deployment of our gasification technology into global projects, we believe our ability to produce a competitively priced and environmentally responsible syngas as an alternative to natural gas and LNG positions us as a syngas energy alternative that bridges between coal markets based on traditional coal burning and the growing natural gas and LNG markets. Thus, while coal is expected to decline as part of global energy consumption, natural gas and LNG are expected to dramatically rise over the same time period. We believe this shift from coal burning offers a compelling opportunity for our technology to utilize the lowest cost coals to produce a clean syngas which can be economically advantaged over LNG in markets where LNG imports are expected to rise such as Asia/ China and Europe.
 
Our syngas technology provides project owners with what we believe can be a very small environmental footprint related to harmful pollutants such as nitrous oxides, sulfur oxides, particulate matter, airborne mercury and heavy metals and is an efficient and responsible user of water resources. However, we face challenges with the growing anti-coal sentiment primarily in the western world where we are doing business in Australia and the European Union. New government regulatory concepts under discussion and review in these regions have the potential of halting all know forms of coal to energy utilization due to caps and penalties related to CO2 generation. We believe we address this new challenge through utilizing our technology’s ability to blend renewable solid feedstocks with coal or by using only renewable solid feedstocks. We also work to educate the market place regarding our syngas technology’s ability to separate and capture significant amounts of CO2 for utilization in other processes.
 
Against this market backdrop, we believe there is potential for increasing demand for new global syngas capacity from coal conversion technologies such as ours. We can see the acceleration of interest in syngas as an energy source by examining the number of global projects either under construction or planned through 2019
 

While traditional uses of gasification technology have predominantly been driven by the chemicals industry, we believe new growth will be within the chemicals industry but will also come from utilization of syngas as a source of industrial fuel gas, SNG and power generation. For example, the global share of energy for power generation is expected to rise to 47% by 2035, according to the BP Energy Outlook 2017 edition, as consumer preference shift towards electricity. Our technological ability to utilize coal in a clean manner to produce syngas for either power generation or a replacement alternative for natural gas and LNG affords us the opportunity to be part of meeting these global energy needs.

We believe that our technology is well positioned to be an important solution that addresses the market needs of the changing global energy landscape. Our gasification technology is unique in its ability to provide an economic, efficient and environmentally responsible alternative to many energy and chemical products normally derived from natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and oil derivatives.
 
Our target markets focus primarily on lower quality coals, biomass and municipal waste where our gasification technology allows energy in the widest range of feedstocks to be unlocked and converted into flexible and valuable syngas. We offer a compelling advantage because of our ability to use such a wide range of solid fuel natural resources. Without our technology, regions where lignite coal, high moisture coal, high ash coal and/or high fines coals exist may face technology barriers which will prevent those resources from being used in energy production. Our technology can transform most of these natural resources into a valuable and flexible syngas product. This clean syngas product can then be used in place of natural gas and oil for making most energy and chemical products.
 
Our primary focus is on the Australia and Eastern Europe markets through AFE and SEE where each have unique market dynamics where we believe we can deploy our technology into projects and provide the investment returns critical to our future success and growth.
 
Because of these market dynamics, we believe our gasification technology has broad strategic importance to:
 

1) | Countries and regions with developing economies which have their own low cost domestic coal resources or easy access to imported low cost coal. Such countries and regions need access to low cost clean energy and chemical products to grow and, in some cases, to provide basic necessities that improve the health and well-being of their populations. These regions have limited access to affordable alternate energy sources like natural gas and oil and can benefit from economic growth by using the lowest cost energy resources such as low cost domestic or imported coal for the production of vital products. Many Asian countries expect to see a surge in expensive imported LNG and a need to utilize their domestic coal to meet their energy product demand increase.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Countries which possess significant low-cost coal resources such as Australia and those in South America and Eastern Europe which also have a strategic need and desire to produce clean and affordable energy and chemicals from their own domestic resources.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Existing operating companies which deploy their own technologies for energy and/or chemicals production or who rely upon oil and natural gas for their industrial applications. These technologies have been well established for use with oil and natural gas resources but are constrained from growing in parts of the world where the oil and natural gas feedstocks are either not readily available due to missing infrastructure and/or very expensive such as LNG in much of Asia. Integrating those established technologies with our technology opens these technologies to a new low cost natural resource in low quality coals thereby transforming the economic opportunity. Such is the case for example in producing power, methanol, DRI steel product, ammonia and urea for fertilizers and many transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | Developed countries such as the United States and Western Europe who are searching for a viable solution for growing biomass and municipal solid waste disposal issues and could also benefit from additional renewable resources.

Competition 
 
Our technology offers an economical and cleaner approach for conversion of coal into energy and chemicals through our ability to economically gasify a wide range of solid-form natural resources including biomass, low quality coals, high quality coals, and coal wastes. We are not aware of commercially available gasifiers with such a wide range of feedstock flexibility. Our gasification technology operates efficiently with high ash and high moisture coals without coal rejection due to particle size and without the formation of tars and oils present in the technology of our competitors.
 
While our technology has been proven to be commercially viable, we are continually seeking to advance and improve our gasification technology, such as through our new XL3000 gasification system. We are continuing to work with our prospective customers to determine the suitability of their low rank coals for our technology through proprietary coal characterization testing and bench scale gasification tests. During the current year we received an additional patent for processes which were a result of our continued development of SGT. We have several additional patent applications pending relating to these technology improvements in addition to a number of other improvements to increase the gasifier availability and to lower the costs of the gasifier installation and subsequent operations.
 
Historically, the most predominant commercially deployed gasification technology providers have been: GE, Shell, Siemens, CB&I and Lurgi. Shell’s technology is now owned by U.S. based company Air Products. With the exception of Lurgi, these competitors utilized entrained flow slagging gasification technologies. The entrained flow technologies operate on more expensive high grade bituminous and some sub-bituminous coals as feedstocks, but lack capability with the more difficult low heating value, high ash and high moisture coals and with biomass or other renewable waste materials. We have seen what we believe are significant changes in the competitive landscape for gasification over the past few years. Primarily this has been reflected in the inability of these long standing traditional entrained flow technologies to meet the needs of the many of the new projects now in development because many of these projects owners are faced with the need to use much lower quality coals or renewable feedstocks. We believe this change in the competitive landscape is pushing SGT and other fluidized bed and moving/fixed bed technologies into the forefront for consideration for future projects.
 
The Lurgi gasification technology, a moving bed gasification technology, is capable of gasifying the lower grade coals, but has more restrictive requirements on feedstock particle size. The Lurgi gasification technology also generates tars and oils in the syngas that have to be removed prior to downstream processing.
 
Several types of simple fluid bed technologies are available. ThyssenKrupp (Uhde division) offers the High Temperature Winkler (“HTW”) technology and there are several versions of very simple, low pressure fluid bed gasifiers offered in Asia. While a number of HTW plants were built and operated, we are not aware of any in current commercial operation. All of these simple fluid bed technologies have more operating temperature limits than SGT, and none have managed to achieve the high conversions which SGT has demonstrated in commercial plants.
 
In addition to these, there are several Chinese gasification technologies that have been commercialized such as East China University and China Aerospace. The Chinese technologies commercialized thus far are derivatives of the historically commercialized western technologies mentioned above and generally fall into the category of entrained flow slagging gasification. To date, commercialization of these technologies has been primarily inside China.
 
The following chart details our view of the current competitive landscape and details the current technologies available on the marketplace, along with their competitive advantages and disadvantages.

Barriers to New Competition
 
Historically gasification technologies have required many years and development costs on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars to reach credible commercial deployment. Because of the costs surrounding such development, gasification technology developed has been historically funded by users with strategic interests and significant economic resources such as major international oil companies or governmental entities looking at alternative clean energy solutions.
 
Most, if not all, gasification technologies have received significant government subsidies in the early research and development stages. Our technology has been highly developed by both GTI and us over the past 40+ years where the technology has been enhanced and commercially deployed. More than $700 million dollars have been spent in the development and commercialization of our SGT technology, including ~$200 million for the research and development required to develop the U-GAS® technology at GTI, ~$200 million of additional funding by us to further technology development and early commercialization, and over $300 million dollars from our Chinese partners and customers providing equity and debt guarantees for the commercial systems now up and running in China. We believe that the current range of available technologies leaves little incentive for development of new technologies, and emerging competition for everyone in the industry will focus on imitation and adaptation.
 
GTI Agreement
 
In November 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement, (the “GTI Agreement”), with the Gas Technology Institute, (“GTI”), replacing the Amended and Restated License Agreement between us and GTI dated August 31, 2006, as amended. Under the GTI Agreement, we maintain our exclusive worldwide right to license the U-GAS® technology for all types of coals and coal/biomass mixtures with coal content exceeding 60%, as well as the non-exclusive right to license the U-GAS® technology for 100% biomass and coal/biomass blends exceeding 40% biomass. We have the right to grant sublicenses, with the approval from GTI, for which we would then owe royalty payments to GTI based on an agreed upon rate schedule. Royalty payments to GTI consist of a minimum annual payment or variable rate payments per the rate schedules dependent upon license agreements, invested equity or carried interests, whichever is higher. The initial term of the contract was for 10 years with two 10-year extensions executable upon notice to GTI. In May 2016, we exercised the first of our two 10-year extensions available and now maintain the exclusive license through 2026.
 
Through 2026, we and GTI are restricted from disclosing any confidential information (as defined in the GTI Agreement) to any person other than employees of affiliates or contractors who are required to deal with such information, and such persons will be bound by the confidentiality provisions of the GTI Agreement. We have further indemnified GTI and its affiliates from any liability or loss resulting from unauthorized disclosure or use of any confidential information that we receive.
 
While the core of our technology is the U-GAS® system, we have continued to innovate and modify the process to a point where we maintain certain intellectual property rights over SGT. Since the original licensing in 2004, we have maintained a strong relationship with GTI and continue to benefit from the resources and collaborative work environment that GTI provides us.
 
Relationships with Strategic Partners and Business Verticals
 
As part of our overall strategy, we intend primarily to (i) work with our existing, AFE and SEE partnership companies to secure new SGT technology and equipment orders and develop energy, chemicals and resource projects where we would own an earned or carried equity interest in the project, (ii) monitor, support and facilitate our minority ownership interest in BFR in order to realize the financial value through dividend income or other means, (iii) work to recover cash and monetize our joint venture operations, Yima and Tianwo-SES, (iv) continue to seek value accretive partnerships to help us grow through strengthening our SGT delivery capability and through creation of new project opportunities and (v) taking necessary steps to utilize our existing cash reserves in the most financially productive means possible.

In July 2015, we entered into a Project Alliance Agreement that expands our exclusive relationship with Midrex Technologies for integration and optimization of DRI technology using coal gasification. Midrex has taken the lead in marketing, sales, proposal development, and project execution for coal gasification DRI projects as part of the new project alliance. Midrex may also lead the construction of the fully integrated solution for customers who desire such an execution strategy. We will provide the DRI gasification technology for each project including engineering, key equipment, and technical services. The agreement includes finalization of an engineering package for the optimized coal gasification DRI solution. Prior to the Project Alliance Agreement, we also entered into an exclusive agreement with Tianwo-SES and Midrex for the joint marketing of coal gasification-based DRI facilities in China. These facilities will combine our gasification technology with the Direct Reduction Process of Midrex to create syngas from low quality coals in order to convert iron ore into high-purity DRI. Tianwo-SES Joint Venture will aid in the marketing of these DRI facilities in China and will supply the gasification equipment and licensing of the technology.
 
Current Operations and Projects
 
Australian Future Energy Pty Ltd 
 
In February 2014, we established AFE together with an Australian company, Ambre Investments PTY Limited (“Ambre”). AFE is an independently managed Australian business platform established for the purpose of building a large-scale, vertically integrated business in Australia based on developing, building and owning equity interests in financially attractive and environmentally responsible projects that produce low cost syngas as a competitive alternative to expensive local natural gas and LNG.
 
On June 9, 2015, we entered into a Master Technology Agreement (the “MTA”) with AFE which was later revised on May 10, 2017 (as described below). Pursuant to the MTA, we have conveyed certain exclusive access rights to our gasification technology in Australia focusing on promotion and use of our technology in projects. AFE is the exclusive operational entity for business relating to our technology in Australia and AFE owns no rights to sub-license our technology. AFE will work with us on project license agreements for use of our technology as projects are developed in Australia. In return for its work, AFE will receive a share of any license fee we receive for project licenses in Australia.
 
On May 10, 2017, we entered into a project technology license agreement with AFE in connection with a project being developed by AFE in Queensland Australia. AFE intends to form a subsidiary project company and assign the project technology license agreement to that company and that company will assume all of the obligations of AFE thereunder. Pursuant to the project technology license agreement, we granted a non-exclusive, license to use our technology at the project to manufacture syngas and to use our technology in the design of the facility. In consideration, the project technology license agreement calls for a license fee to be finalized based on the finalized plant capacity and a separate fee of $2.0 million for the delivery of a process design package. License fees shall be paid as project milestones are reached throughout the planning, construction and first five years of plant operations. The success and timing of the project being developed by AFE will affect if and/or when we will be able to receive all of the payments from this license agreement. However, there can be no assurance that AFE will be successful in developing this or any other project.
 
If AFE makes, whether patentable or not, improvements relating to our technology, they grant to us and our affiliates, an irrevocable royalty free right to use or license such improvements and agrees to make such improvements available free of charge.
 
AFE provides indemnity to us for damages resulting from the use of the technology in a manner other than as contemplated by the license, while we indemnify AFE to the extent that the intellectual property associated with the technology is found to infringe on the rights of a third party. Either party may terminate the license in connection with a material breach by the other party or the other party’s bankruptcy. AFE may also terminate if we fail to diligently commence the process design package as contemplated by the license. We also provide a guarantee of all obligations under the license. If we are unable to fulfil our obligations under this agreement, AFE may terminate the agreement and be entitled to a full, irrevocable, and unencumbered license for the duration of its project to use without any further payment to us.
 
AFE has evaluated multiple project opportunities and is currently focused on three projects, all in the state of Queensland, targeted to produce a combination of syngas and methane for industrial fuel gas plus ammonia and electric power.
 
In 2016, AFE completed the creation and spin-off of Batchfire Resources Pty Ltd (“BFR”) (as discussed below) as a separate standalone company which acquired and operates the Callide thermal coal mine in Queensland.
 
In August 2017, AFE completed the acquisition of a mine development lease related to the 266-million-ton resource near Pentland, Queensland through AFE’s wholly owned subsidiary, Great Northern Energy Pty Ltd (“GNE”). GNE has a 100% ownership interest in the Pentland Coal Mine. GNE is currently finalizing the preparation of its Initial Advice Statement of the Pentland Coal Mine project to the Queensland Government for the development of the project for an initial 6.0 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) ROM coal operation, with allowance for expansion of the project for up to 9.0 million mtpa ROM coal operation. In its first phase of operation, 4.5 million mtpa of coal is planned for export to Asian markets with the balance of 1.5 million mtpa for feedstock to a future proposed coal gasification project. It is anticipated, based on current planning, for the project to be operational in 2022. A drilling program is planned to commence in late 2018 to expand the size and overall quality and understanding of the Pentland resource.

In September 2018, AFE’s Gladstone Energy and Ammonia Project (“GEAP”) was formally announced in Queensland Parliament by Minister for State Development, Manufacturing, Innovation and Planning, Mr. Cameron Dick and was declared by the Queensland Co-Ordinator General as a Co-Ordinated Project. A coordinated project approach also means that all the potential impacts and benefits of the project are considered in an integrated and comprehensive manner and the Coordinator-General’s decision to declare this project a Coordinated Project is expected to help streamline approvals and fast-track delivery of the project.
 
The project will be located in the State Development Area in Gladstone, Queensland and is planned to process 1.5 million mtpa of low-quality coal using SGT, to produce up to 330,000 mpta of ammonia product, and up to 8 petajoules of pipeline quality gas for the east coast domestic gas market. In addition, the proposed project will generate approximately 90 MW of electrical power, with approximately 25 MW of this being available for export to the local domestic grid. The ammonia and gas produced is to be used by major industrial users, including those focusing on agriculture, the mining industry and advanced manufacturing. The project is estimated by AFE to commence construction by mid-2020, with the first ammonia production proposed in mid-2022.
 
For our ownership interest in AFE, we have been contributing cash and engineering support for AFE’s business development while Ambre contributed cash and services. Additional ownership in AFE has been granted to the AFE management team and staff individuals providing services to AFE. In January 2017, we elected to increase our ownership interest in AFE by contributing approximately $0.4 million of cash. In August 2017 and March 2018, we elected to make additional contributions of $0.47 million and $0.16 million respectively to assist AFE with developing its business in Australia.
 
Batchfire Resources Pty Ltd 
 
As a result of AFE’s early stage business development efforts associated with the Callide coal mine in Central Queensland, Australia, AFE created BFR. BFR was a spin-off company for which ownership interest was distributed to the existing shareholders of AFE and to the new BFR management team in December 2015. BFR is registered in Australia and was formed for the purpose of purchasing the Callide thermal coal mine from Anglo-American plc (“Anglo-American”). The Callide mine is one of the largest thermal coal mines in Australia and has been in operation for more than 20 years.
 
In October 2016, BFR stated that it had received investment support for the acquisition from Singapore-based Lindenfels Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of commodity traders Avra Commodities. The acquisition of the Callide thermal coal mine from Anglo-American was completed in October 2016.
 
In January 2018, the Minister of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy approved BFR’s mining lease application through to 2043 for Callide coal mine’s Boundary Hill South Project. The Callide mining tenure extends across 180 square kilometers and contains an estimated coal resource of up to 1.7 billion metric tons and saleable coal production averages 10 million metric tons per year. BFR is implementing its mining plan at Callide intended to lower the per unit mining costs and deliver profitable financial results.
 
SES EnCoal Energy sp. z o.o
 
In October 2017, we entered into agreements with Warsaw-based EnInvestments sp. z o.o. Under the terms of the agreements, we and EnInvestments are equal shareholders of SEE and SEE will exclusively market, develop, and commercialize projects in Poland which utilize our technology, services, and proprietary equipment and we share with SEE a portion of the technology license payments, net of fees, we receive from Poland. The goal of SEE is to establish efficient clean energy projects that provide Polish industries superior economic benefits as compared to the use of expensive, imported natural gas and LNG, while providing energy independence through our technological capabilities to convert the wide range of Poland’s indigenous coals, coal waste, biomass and municipal waste to valuable syngas products.  SEE has developed a pipeline of projects and together with us is actively working with Polish customers and partners to complete necessary project feasibility, permitting, and SGT technology agreement steps required prior to starting construction on the projects.
 
Tauron Wytwarzanie S.A., (“Tauron”), has contracted Poland’s Institute of Coal Chemistry (“IChPW”) to complete a detailed preliminary design assessment and economic study for the conversion of its 200MW conventional power boilers to clean syngas which would be Poland’s first SGT facility. The project feasibility study concluded in March 2018 with positive results. The results presented by IChPW to Tauron have shown that the conversion of Tauron’s 200 MW power boiler utilizing SGT can be both economically attractive and environmentally beneficial. We believe that SGT power boiler conversions are an ideal solution capable of meeting EU and IED targets.
 
For our ownership interest in SEE, we have been contributing cash and assisting in the development of SEE. SEE was initially funded in January 2018 with a cash contribution of approximately $6,000 and an additional funding in March 2018 of approximately $76,000.

Yima Joint Venture 
 
In August 2009, we entered into joint venture contracts and related agreements with Yima Coal Industry Group Company (“Yima”), replacing the prior joint venture contracts entered in October 2008 and April 2009. The joint ventures were formed for each of the gasification, methanol/methanol protein production, and utility island components of the plant (collectively the “Yima Joint Venture”). The joint venture contracts provided that we and Yima contribute equity of 25% and 75%, respectively, to the Yima Joint Venture. The remaining capital for the project construction has been funded with project debt obtained by the Yima Joint Venture. Yima agreed to guarantee the project debt in order to secure debt financing from domestic Chinese banking sources. We agreed to pledge to Yima our ownership interests in the joint ventures as security for our obligations. In the event that the necessary additional debt financing is not obtained, Yima agreed to provide a loan to the joint venture to satisfy the remaining capital needs of the project with terms comparable to current market rates at the time of the loan. Yima also agreed to provide coal to the project at preferential pricing under a side-letter agreement related to the JV contracts. To date, Yima has not provided coal at preferential price to the project and we do not believe Yima will do so in the future.
 
The term of the joint venture commenced June 9, 2009 at the time each joint venture company obtained its business operating license and shall end 30 years after the business license issue date, June 8, 2039. As discussed below, in November 2016, as part of an overall corporate restructuring plan, these joint ventures were combined into a single joint venture.
 
We continue to own a 25% interest in the Yima Joint Venture and Yima owns a 75% interest. Notwithstanding this, in connection with an expansion of the project, we have the option to contribute a greater percentage of capital for the expansion, such that as a result, we could expand through contributions, at our election, up to a 49% ownership interest in the Yima Joint Venture.
 
Despite initiating methanol production in December 2012, the Yima Joint Venture’s plant continued its construction through the beginning of 2016. In March 2016, the Yima Joint Venture completed the required performance testing of the SGT systems and successfully issued its Performance Test Certificate, which is the point that we considered the plant to be completed. 
 
In 2016, the plant faced increasing regulatory scrutiny from the environmental and safety bureaus as the plant was not built in full compliance with its original submitted designs. In June 2016, the local environmental bureau requested that the plant temporarily halt operations to address certain issues identified by the environmental bureau. These issues affected the joint venture’s ability to receive its final operating and safety permits and were related to the original approval for methanol protein production and the original three JV business structure. This has been addressed and fully resolved and the three joints ventures were combined into one in November 2016. The Yima Joint Venture returned to operations in late November 2016 and in November 2017, the Yima Joint Venture completed the required safety testing and successfully received its safety production permit from the Henan government and it subsequently received the Industry Products License in May 2018, allowing for its products to be sold on the open market and an updated business license was successfully obtained in January 2018.
 
Since the plant restored operations in November 2016, it has had periods of running at full design capacity and periods of operations at lower levels of production. The primary operational issues have been related to operational errors, equipment quality that has caused increased downtime and the failure to secure coal supply. The plant experienced a 90-day period in which it operated at full capacity ending in August 2017. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, the plant produced 185,761 tons of pure methanol, its best fiscal year performance to date. We continue to see signs of overall improvement in operations, resulting in longer periods of production at design capacity.
 
In December 2017 and January 2018, on-going development cooperation and discussions with the Yima Joint Venture management resulted in the joint venture agreeing to pay various costs incurred by us during the construction and commissioning period of the facility in the amount of approximately 16 million Chinese Renminbi yuan, (“RMB”). As of June 30, 2018, we have received 6.15 million RMB (approximately $0.9 million) of payments from the Yima Joint Venture related to these costs. Additional payments may be forthcoming. Due to uncertainty, revenues will be recorded upon receipt of payment.
 
Tianwo-SES Clean Energy Technologies Limited 
 
Joint Venture Contract
 
In February 2014, SES Asia Technologies Limited, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into a Joint Venture Contract (the “JV Contract”) with Zhangjiagang Chemical Machinery Co., Ltd., which subsequently changed its legal name to Suzhou Thvow Technology Co. Ltd. (“STT”), to form Tianwo-SES Clean Energy Technologies Limited, (“Tianwo-SES Joint Venture”). The purpose of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture is to establish our gasification technology as the leading gasification technology in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory (which is China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Mongolia and Malaysia) by becoming a leading provider of proprietary equipment and engineering services for the technology. The scope of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture is to market and license our gasification technology via project sublicenses; procurement and sale of proprietary equipment and services; coal testing; and engineering, procurement and research and development related to the technology. STT contributed 53.8 million RMB (approximately $8.0 million) in April 2014 and was required to contribute an additional 46.2 million RMB (approximately $6.8 million) within two years of such date for a total contribution of 100 million RMB (approximately $14.8 million) in cash to the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture in return for a 65% ownership interest in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture. The second capital contribution from STT of 46.2 million RMB (approximately $6.8 million) was not paid by STT in April 2016 as required by the initial JV Contract. As part of a restructuring of the agreement described below, the obligation for payment of additional registered capital was removed.

We have contributed certain exclusive technology sub-licensing rights into the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture for the territory pursuant to the terms of a Technology Usage and Contribution Agreement (the “TUCA”) entered into among the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture, STT and us on the same date and further described in more detail below. This resulted in an original ownership of 35% of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture by SES. Under the JV Contract, neither party may transfer their interests in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture without first offering such interests to the other party.
 
In August 2017, we entered into a restructuring agreement of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture (“Restructuring Agreement”). The agreed change in share ownership, reduction in the registered capital of the joint venture, and the final transfer of shares with local government authorities was completed in December 2017. In this restructuring, an additional party was added to the JV Contract, upon receipt of final government approvals, The Innovative Coal Chemical Design Institute (“ICCDI”) has become a 25% owner of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture, we have decreased our ownership to 25% and STT has decreased its ownership to 50%. ICCDI previously served as general contractor and engineered and constructed all three projects which utilize SGT in seven gasification systems. Equipment orders related to these projects were secured by our joint venture partner, Zhangjiangang Chemical Machinery Co., Ltd. The projects are located in the provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi, have been completed and are currently operating for the Aluminum Corporation of China.
 
We received 11.15 million RMB (approximately $1.7 million) from ICCDI as a result of this restructuring. In conjunction with the joint venture restructuring, we also received 1.2 million RMB (approximately $180,000) related to outstanding invoices for services we had provided to the Tianwo SES Joint Venture. The inclusion of ICCDI as an owner has the potential to enhance the joint venture’s bidding ability and we believe the joint venture will focus on securing larger coal to chemical projects as well as continue to pursue projects in the industrial fuels segment.
 
In addition to the ownership changes described above, the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture board of directors (the “Board”) was changed to consist of eight directors, four appointed by STT, two appointed by ICCDI and two appointed by us. All significant acts as described in the JV Contract require the unanimous approval of the Board.
 
The JV Contract also includes a non-competition provision which requires that the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture be the exclusive legal entity within the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory for the marketing and sale of any gasification technology or related equipment that utilizes low quality coal feedstock. Notwithstanding this, STT retained the right to manufacture and sell gasification equipment outside the scope of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture within the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory. In addition, we retained the right to develop and invest equity in projects outside of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture within the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory. As a result of the Restructuring Agreement, we have further retained the right to provide gasification technology licenses and to sell proprietary equipment directly into projects in the joint venture territory provided we have an equity interest in the project. After the termination of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture, STT and ICCDI must obtain written consent from us to market development of any gasification technology that utilizes low quality coal feedstock in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory.
 
The JV Contract may be terminated upon, among other things: (i) a material breach of the JV Contract which is not cured, (ii) a violation of the TUCA, (iii) the failure to obtain positive net income within 24 months of establishing the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture or (iv) mutual agreement of the parties.
 
TUCA
 
Pursuant to the TUCA, we have contributed to the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture certain exclusive rights to our gasification technology in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory, including the right to: (i) grant site specific project sub-licenses to third parties; (ii) use our marks for proprietary equipment and services; (iii) engineer and/or design processes that utilize our technology or our other intellectual property; (iv) provide engineering and design services for joint venture projects and (v) take over the development of projects in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory that have previously been developed by us and our affiliates. As a result of the Restructuring Agreement, ICCDI was added as a party to the TUCA, but all other material terms remained the same.
 
The Tianwo-SES Joint Venture will be the exclusive operational entity for business relating to our technology in the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture territory, except for projects in which SES has an equity ownership position. For these projects, as a result of the Restructuring Agreement, we can provide technology and equipment directly, with no obligation to the joint venture. If the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture loses exclusivity due to a breach by us, STT and ICCDI are to be compensated for direct losses and all lost project profits. We were also required to provide training for technical personnel of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture through the second anniversary of the establishment of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture, which has now passed. We will also provide a review of engineering works for the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture. If modifications are suggested by us and not made, the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture bears the liability resulting from such failure. If we suggest modifications and there is still liability resulting from the engineering work, it is our liability.
 
12

 

Any party making improvements, whether patentable or not, relating to our technology after the establishment of the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture, grants to the other party an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty free right to use or license such improvements and agrees to make such improvements available to us free of charge. All such improvements shall become part of our technology and all parties shall have the same rights, licenses and obligations with respect to the improvement as contemplated by the TUCA.
 
The Tianwo-SES Joint Venture is required to establish an Intellectual Property Committee, with two representatives from the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture and two from SES. This Committee shall review all improvements and protection measures and recommend actions to be taken by the Tianwo-SES Joint Venture in furtherance thereof. Notwithstanding this, each party is entitled to take actions on its own to protect intellectual property rights. As of June 30, 2018, that committee was yet to be formed.
 
Any breach of or default under the TUCA which is not cured on notice entitles the non-breaching party to terminate. The Tianwo-SES Joint Venture indemnifies us for misuse of our technology or infringement of our technology upon rights of any third party.
 
Synthesis Energy Systems (Zao Zhuang) New Gas Company Ltd.
 
In July 2006, we entered into a cooperative joint venture contract with Shandong Hai Hua Xuecheng Energy Co. Ltd. (“Xuecheng Energy”) which established Synthesis Energy Systems (Zao Zhuang) New Gas Company Ltd. (“ZZ Joint Venture”). The ZZ Joint Venture’s primary purpose was to develop, construct and operate a syngas production plant utilizing SGT in Zao Zhuang City, Shandong Province, China and producing and selling syngas and the various byproducts of the plant.
 
We initially owned 97.6% of the ZZ Joint Venture and Xuecheng Energy owned the remaining 2.4%. In June 2015, we entered into a Share Purchase and Investment Agreement, (the “SPA”), with Rui Feng Enterprises Limited (“Rui Feng”), whereby Rui Feng would acquire a controlling interest in Synthesis Energy Systems Investments Inc. (“SESI”), and a wholly owned subsidiary, which owns our interest in the ZZ Joint Venture.  Under the terms of the SPA, SESI originally agreed to sell an approximately 61% equity interest to Rui Feng in exchange for $10.0 million.  This amount was to be paid in four installments through December 2016, with the first installment of approximately $1.6 million paid on June 26, 2015. However, Rui Feng did not make any subsequent payments. This resulted in our majority ownership (approximately 88.1%) until we eventually restructured our ownership with Xuecheng Energy.
 
In August 2016, we announced that we and Xuecheng Energy entered into a definitive agreement to restructure the ZZ Joint Venture. Due to the Chinese government’s widespread initiative to move industry into larger scale, commercial and environmentally beneficial industrial parks, it became clear that the plant was no longer going to be allowed to operate in its current location. As a result, we retain an approximate nine percent ownership in the ZZ Joint Venture asset, and Xuecheng Energy assumed all outstanding liabilities of the ZZ Joint Venture, including payables related to the Cooperation Agreement with Xuecheng Energy signed in 2013. The definitive agreement took full effect when the registration with the government was completed on October 31, 2016. With the closure of this transaction, SES does not anticipate any future liabilities related to the ZZ Joint Venture. The ZZ Joint Venture was a very successful demonstration of our technology and its operational history and commercial operations helped provide the foundation for our technology, SGT.
 
During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we deconsolidated the ZZ Joint Venture and began accounting for our nine percent investment in the ZZ Joint Venture under the cost method. The carrying value of our investment in the ZZ Joint Venture was zero at both June 30, 2018 and 2017.
 
Business Development, Engineering and Project Management
 
Management and Business Development Staff 
 
We currently employ a staff of experienced management and business development professionals in both the U.S. and China that are focused on opportunities in our target markets. The management and business development team are focused on the disciplined development of new business for gasification projects, licensing opportunities and other technology products and services which maximize the advantages of our gasification technology. Members of the team have either led or participated in the development of multiple coal and natural gas power projects, coal gasification projects, chemical and gasification licensing transactions globally over the past three decades. In addition, we utilize consultants and our relationships with our strategic partners to further supplement our staff in developing relationships with potential customers.
Technology, Engineering and Project Management Staff
 
We have a capable and seasoned technology team, with skill sets ranging from detailed design engineering, project management and plant commissioning experience. Our engineers leverage their gasification and process industry knowledge to continuously improve SGT using data collected from our commercial licensees and test platforms. These improvements increase overall plant reliability, while reducing the capital and operating costs for our project partners, as well as develop core intellectual property for the company. The team is engaged during the earliest stages of project development, allowing for more precise planning and optimization of the integrated technologies. This provides a further competitive edge with respect to cost and project development cycle times. In addition to our technology engineering team, we leverage our resource capability through partnering with international engineering and procurement companies with significant gasification experience.

Business Concentration
 
Our assets in China accounted for approximately 52% of our total assets as of June 30, 2018, which includes our investment in the Yima Joint Venture and other miscellaneous assets. While our balance sheet shows a significant business concentration in China, we are primarily focused on developing our assets outside of China which we believe will be responsible for a large percentage of our financial results going forward.
Suppliers
 
China has rapidly expanded its industrial manufacturing and construction capabilities. This has reduced the cost and build time of traditional sources of supply. In China, through our strategic relationships, we have been successful in locating and contracting with a number of key suppliers of major equipment and services.
 
For projects outside of China, we plan to continue to leverage our strong ties and partnerships in China to provide low cost equipment and engineering into our projects. In locations where local sourcing is of value, we expect to be able to develop supply chain capabilities for our equipment utilizing experienced industrial manufacturing capabilities and low-cost sources of labor and materials that will benefit our technology.
 
Patents
 
We currently hold multiple U.S. and international patents and a number of pending patent applications, primarily relating to new technology developments that we have made to the U-GAS® technology, known as SGT. This includes our gasification process, the integration of our gasification process with downstream uses and the equipment design for our gasification facilities. Although in the aggregate our patents are important to us, we do not regard any individual patent as critical or essential to our business.
 
Prior to us entering into the GTI Agreement, U-GAS® had not been commercially deployed on coal above approximately 150 tons per day per gasification system nor had it been commercially deployed on coal using pure oxygen as a reactant or at elevated pressures. Today, we have commercially deployed the technology at a scale of 1,200 tons per day of coal feed using pure oxygen as a reactant and at pressures of up to 10 bar.
 
In addition, we also have new designs completed, with more in process today, and we are quoting gasification systems for customers that would increase our gasification capacity to approximately 3,000 tons per day of coal using pure oxygen as a reactant at pressures up to 55 bar. We have made improvements to the U-GAS technology which have either been patented, are in the process of patenting, or are held by us as trade secrets. In addition, we have several new improvements which are currently in development associated with designs of our higher pressure and higher capacity systems that will further enhance the efficiency of the gasification process or reduce capital or operating expenses.
 
Project and Technical Development
 
We may incur internal and third-party project and technical development costs related to the advancement of our gasification technology and related processes. We plan to continue certain development initiatives that support our strategies and project development activities with a goal of offering our customers the best and most efficient clean coal solutions.
Environmental Regulation 
 
Our operations are subject to stringent national, provincial state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies, including various Chinese and Australian authorities, issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties or may result in injunctive relief for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before construction or operation at a facility commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with such activities, limit or prohibit construction activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution.

Our facilities may require permits for or be constrained by permit conditions in relation to acceptable air emissions and wastewater discharges, as well as other authorizations, some of which must be issued before construction commences.  Issuance of these permits could be subject to unpredictable delays, contests and even, in some cases, denial or refusal.  Although we believe that there will be support for our projects, the permitting process could be complex and time consuming and the issuance of permits may be subject to the potential for contest and other regulatory uncertainties that may result in unpredictable delays. We are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements.
 
In addition, some recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases,” may be contributing to the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere.  In response to such studies, many countries are actively considering legislation, or have already taken legal measures, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  Examples of such legislation and new legal measures include new environmental laws and regulations that could impose a carbon tax, a cap and trade program requiring us to purchase carbon credits, or measures that would require reductions in emissions or require modification of raw materials, fuel use or production rates.  In China, the Environmental Protection Tax Law entered into force on January 1, 2018, pursuant to which enterprises that directly discharge taxable pollutants within the territory of China and maritime space under its justification shall pay environmental protection tax. This legislation includes two appendices, one of which provides for the tax rate of different pollutants and the other lists taxable pollutants and pollution equivalent. According to this legislation, the environmental protection tax has replaced the pollutant discharge fee since January 1, 2018.
 
Carbon dioxide, (CO2), a byproduct of burning fossil fuels such as coal, is an example of a greenhouse gas.  Regardless of technology used in gasification facilities, there is carbon dioxide released whenever the syngas is cleaned and prepared for energy or chemicals production.  We believe that gasification is currently the most desirable technology for processing coal if CO2 emissions become regulated. This is because gasification and the adjacent syngas cleaning technologies separate the CO2 produced from the final products and thereby create a rich CO2 stream that can be captured, sequestered and/or sold. However, greenhouse gas regulations can add production and capital cost to all fossil fuel technologies and may require us or our customers to obtain additional permits, meet additional control requirements, install additional environmental mitigation equipment, or take other as yet unknown steps to comply with such potential regulations, which could adversely affect our financial performance. 
 
In 2013, the U.S. and a number of international development banks, including the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, announced that they would no longer provide financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants or would do so only in narrowly defined circumstances. Other international development banks, such as the Asian Development Bank and the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation, have continued to provide such financing.
 
The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in December 1997 by the signatories to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), established a binding set of greenhouse gas emission targets for developed nations. The U.S. signed the Kyoto Protocol, but it has never been ratified by the U.S. Senate. Australia ratified the Kyoto Protocol in December 2007 and became a full member in March 2008. There were discussions to develop a treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol after the expiration of its commitment period in 2012, including at the UNFCCC conferences in Copenhagen (2009), Cancun (2010), Durban (2011), Doha (2012) and Paris (2015). At the Durban conference, an ad hoc working group was established to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the UNFCCC, applicable to all parties. At the Doha meeting, an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, which included new commitments for certain parties in a second commitment period, from 2013 to 2020. In December 2012, Australia signed on to the second commitment period. During the UNFCCC conference in Paris, France in late 2015, an agreement was adopted calling for voluntary emissions reductions contributions after the second commitment period ends in 2020. The agreement was entered into force on November 4, 2016 after ratification and execution by more than 55 countries that account for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Both Australia and the United States ratified the agreement. On August 4, 2017 the United States formally signaled its intention to withdraw from the agreement (although it has not yet withdrawn).
 
Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S., some of its states or other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. Further, policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power stations could adversely impact the global demand for coal in the future. The potential financial impact on us of future laws, regulations or other policies will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws, regulations or other policies, the time periods over which those laws, regulations or other policies would be phased in, the state of commercial development and deployment of CCUS technologies and the alternative uses for coal. From time to time, we attempt to analyze the potential impact on the Company of as-yet-unadopted, potential laws, regulations and policies. Such analysis require that we make significant assumptions as to the specific provisions of such potential laws, regulations and policies. These analyses sometimes show that certain potential laws, regulations and policies, if implemented in the manner assumed by the analyses, could result in material adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flow, in view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these potential laws, regulations and policies. We do not believe that such analyses reasonably predict the quantitative impact that future laws, regulations or other policies may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Australian Regulatory Matters
 
Native Title and Cultural Heritage. Since 1992, the Australian courts have recognized that native title to lands, as recognized under the laws and customs of the Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, may have survived the process of European settlement. These developments are supported by Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) which recognizes and protects native title, and under which a national register of native title claims and determinations has been established. Native title rights do not extend to minerals; however, native title rights can be affected by the mining process unless those rights have previously been extinguished thereby requiring negotiation with the registered native title claimants or determined native title holders (as applicable) (and potentially the payment of compensation) prior to the grant of certain mining tenements. There is also federal and state legislation to prevent damage to and manage Aboriginal cultural heritage and archaeological sites.
Mining Tenements and Environmental. In Queensland and New South Wales, the development of a mine requires both the grant of a right to extract the resource and an approval which authorizes the environmental impact. These approvals are obtained under separate legislation from separate government authorities. The application processes can run concurrently and are also concurrent with any native title or cultural heritage process that is required. The environmental impacts of mining projects are regulated by state and federal governments. Federal regulation will only apply if the particular project will, or is likely to, significantly impact a matter of national environmental significance (for example, a water resource, an endangered species or particular protected places). Environmental approvals processes involve complex issues that, on occasion, require lengthy studies and documentation. Typically mining proponents must also reach agreement with the owners of land underlying proposed mining tenements prior to the grant and/or conduct of mining activities or otherwise acquire the land. These arrangements generally involve the payment of compensation in lieu of the impacts of mining on the land.
 
Australian mining operations are generally subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations. At the federal level, these legislative acts include, but are not limited to, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth), Native Title Act 1993 (Cth), Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth), Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth). Foreign investors into Australia may also require approval of the Foreign Investment Review Board.
 
In Queensland, laws and regulations related to mining include, but are not limited to, the Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld), Mineral and Energy Resources (Common Provisions) Act 2014 (Qld) (MERCP Act), Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld) (EP Act), Environmental Protection Regulation 2008 (Qld), potentially the Planning Act 2016 (Qld), Building Act 1975 (Qld), Explosives Act 1999 (Qld), Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003 (Qld), Native Title (Queensland) Act 1993 (Qld), Water Act 2000 (Qld), State Development and Public Works Organization Act 1971 (Qld), Queensland Heritage Act 1992 (Qld), Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 (Qld), Nature Conservation Act 1992 (Qld), Vegetation Management Act 1999 (Qld), Land Act 1994 (Qld), Regional Planning Interests Act 2014 (Qld), Fisheries Act 1994 (Qld) and the Forestry Act 1959 (Qld). Under the EP Act, policies have been developed to achieve the objectives of the law and provide guidance on specific areas of the environment, including air, noise, water and waste management. Increased emphasis has recently been placed on topics including, but not limited to, hazardous dams assessment, the protection of strategic cropping land, the assessment and provision of financial assurance and undertaking rehabilitation of mining activities. The MERCP Act commenced on September 27, 2016 and included significant reforms to the management of overlapping coal and coal seam gas tenements and the coordination of activities and access to private and public land. In November 2016, amendments to the EP Act and the Water Act 2000 (Qld) became effective and facilitate regulatory scrutiny of the environmental impacts of underground water extraction during the operational phase of resource projects for all tenements yet to commence mineral extraction. The ‘Chain of Responsibility’ provisions of the EP Act, effective in April 2016, allow the regulator to issue an environmental protection order (EPO) to a related person of a company in two circumstances; (a) if an EPO has been issued to the company, an EPO can also be issued to a related person of the company (at the same time or later); or (b) if the company is a high risk company (as defined in the EP Act), an EPO can be issued to a related person of the company (whether or not an EPO has also been issued to the company). A guideline has been issued to provide more certainty to industry on the circumstances when an EPO may be issued.
 
In New South Wales, laws and regulations related to mining include, but are not limited to, the Mining Act 1992 (NSW), Work Health and Safety (Mines and Petroleum Sites) Act 2013 (NSW), Mine Subsidence Compensation Act 1961 (NSW), Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) (EP&A Act), Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulations 2000 (NSW), Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW), Contaminated Land Management Act 1997 (NSW), Explosives Act 2003 (NSW), Water Management Act 2000 (NSW), Water Act 1912 (NSW), Radiation Control Act 1990 (NSW), Heritage Act 1977 (NSW), Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW), Crown Lands Act 1989 (NSW), Dangerous Goods (Road and Rail Transport) Act 2008 (NSW), Fisheries Management Act 1994 (NSW), Forestry Act 2012 (NSW), Native Title (New South Wales) Act 1994 (NSW), Roads Act 1993 (NSW) and National Parks & Wildlife Act 1974 (NSW). Under the EP&A Act, environmental planning instruments must be considered when approving a mining project development application. There are multiple State Environmental Planning Policies (SEPPs) relevant to coal projects in New South Wales. Amendments to the SEPPs that cover mining have occurred in the past two years and are aimed at protecting agriculture, water resources and critical industry clusters. One SEPP, referred to as the “Mining SEPP”, was amended in late 2013 to make it mandatory for decision makers to consider the economic significance of coal resources when determining a development application for a mine and to give primacy to that consideration. While this amendment was repealed in 2015, decision makers still have regard to the significance of a resource and the State and regional economic benefits of a proposed coal mine when considering a development application on the basis that it is an element of the “public interest” head of consideration contained in the legislation.

Mining Rehabilitation (Reclamation). Mine reclamation is regulated by state specific legislation. As a condition of approval for mining operations, companies are required to progressively rehabilitate mined land and provide appropriate security to the relevant state government as a safeguard to cover the costs of rehabilitation in circumstances where mine operators are unable to do so. Self-bonding is not permitted. BFR has provided security to the relevant authorities which are calculated in accordance with current regulatory requirements. BFR operate in both the Queensland and New South Wales state jurisdictions.
New South Wales reclamation. The Mining Act 1992 (NSW) (Mining Act) is administered by the Department of Planning and Environment and authorizes the holder of a mining tenement to extract a mineral subject to obtaining consent under the EP&A and other auxiliary approvals and licenses.
 
Through the Mining Act, environmental protection and rehabilitation are regulated by conditions in all mining leases and environmental authorities including requirements for the submission of a Mining Operations Plan (MOP) prior to the commencement of operations. All mining operations must be carried out in accordance with the MOP which describes site activities and the progress toward environmental and rehabilitation outcomes and are updated on a regular basis or if mine plans change. The mines publicly report their reclamation performance on an annual basis.
 
In support of the MOP process, a rehabilitation cost estimate is calculated periodically to determine the amount of bond support required to cover the cost of rehabilitation based on extent of disturbance during the MOP period.
 
Queensland rehabilitation. The EP Act is administered by the Department of Environment and Science which authorizes environmentally relevant activities such as mining activities relating to a mining lease through an Environmental Authority (EA). Environmental protection and rehabilitation activities are regulated by conditions in the EA, including the requirement for the submission of a Plan of Operations (PO) prior to the commencement of operations. Currently, all mining operations must be carried out in accordance with the PO which describes site activities and the progress toward environmental and rehabilitation outcomes and are updated on a regular basis or if mine plans change. The mines submit an annual return reporting on their EA compliance including rehabilitation performance. The Queensland Government is in the process of reviewing the requirement of a PO for mining activities. Legislation (in the form of a Bill) was introduced in the Queensland parliament in February 2018 that instead requires entities undertaking mining activities to prepare a ‘life of mine’ progressive rehabilitation and closure plan (PRCP) which will be binding in the undertaking of a mining activity and include annual reporting and regular auditing requirements.
 
The Bill requires EA holders to prepare a detailed PRCP which is to include information detailing how mining activities will be undertaken to maximize progressive rehabilitation of the land to a stable condition. The PRCP will provide for specific rehabilitation milestones and non-compliance will be an offence.
 
As a condition of the EA, financial security requirements are calculated to determine the amount of bonding required to cover the cost of rehabilitation based on extent of disturbance during the PO period. The Bill will also amend the way in which financial security is calculated and provided. The new regime is to consider the risk profile of the EA holder for the mining activity and the risk profile of the particular mining project so that security is either provided by way of a contribution to a fund or by other surety.
 
At this stage, it is expected that the Bill is likely to be passed by the Queensland parliament in October 2018 with commencement to occur by the end of 2018 or in early 2019.
 
Occupational Health and Safety. Broadly, State legislation requires persons conducting a business or undertaking to provide and maintain a safe workplace by providing safe systems of work, safety equipment and appropriate information, instruction, training and supervision. Specific occupational health and safety obligations have been mandated under state legislation to account for the specialized nature of the coal mining industry. The concepts are typically similar to the general occupational health and safety legislation however, there are some differences in the terminology, the application and detail of the laws. The most noteworthy difference being that coal mining safety laws are more prescriptive when compared to general occupational health and safety laws. Further, mining operators, executive officers (including directors and other officers of a corporate entity), employees with statutory appointments (e.g. site senior executives) and all other persons (including coal mine workers and all other persons at a mine) are subject to the obligations under this legislation.
 
A small number of coal mine workers in Queensland and New South Wales have been diagnosed with coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP, also known as black lung) following decades of assumed eradication of the disease. This led to a Parliamentary inquiry into CWP with a report tabled before the Queensland parliament in May 2017. The report made a series of recommendations regarding the detection and monitoring of CWP as well as recommending the relevant legislation better support these initiatives. The report also noted that the government authority (the Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy) responsible for regulating CWP (amongst broader occupational health and safety issues pertaining to the resources and mining sector) failed to properly administer the relevant legislation.

The Queensland Government released its formal response to the recommendations tabled before Parliament. Following the recommendations, and a consultation process, the Queensland Government made a number of changes to the coal mining legislation, specifically with a view to prevent and monitor issues contributing to CWP. Following the report, the Queensland Government’s initial response was to release a draft Bill establishing a mine health and safety regulatory body that is independent from the Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy. This Bill has not been passed by Parliament and further amendments to the Bill have been tabled.
 
Industrial Relations. A national industrial relations system administered by the federal government applies to all private sector employers and employees. The matters regulated under the national system include employment conditions, unfair dismissal, enterprise bargaining, bullying claims, industrial action and resolution of workplace disputes. Many of the workers employed or to be employed by AFE and BFR are covered by enterprise agreements approved under the national system.
 
Greenhouse Gases. In 2007, a single, national reporting system relating to greenhouse gas emissions, energy use and energy production was introduced. The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth) (NGER Act) imposes requirements for corporations meeting a certain threshold to register and report greenhouse gas emissions and abatement actions, as well as energy production and consumption. The Clean Energy Regulator administers the NGER Act. The Commonwealth Department of Environment is responsible for NGER Act-related policy developments and review. Both foreign and local corporations that meet the prescribed carbon dioxide and energy production or consumption limits in Australia (Controlling Corporations) must comply with the NGER Act.
 
On July 1, 2016, amendments to the NGER Act implemented the Emission Reduction Fund Safeguard Mechanism. From that date, large designated facilities such as coal mines were issued with a baseline for their covered emissions and must take steps to keep their emissions below the baseline, comply with their statutory obligations by some other means (for example, by purchasing and surrendering Australian carbon credit units to offset emissions over the baseline) or face penalties.
 
Queensland Royalty. As a general rule, royalties are payable to the State of Queensland for extracted coal. Statutory formulas under the Mineral Resources Regulation 2013 (Qld) are used to calculate the royalty rates (expressed as a percentage) for coal sold, disposed of, or used, where the average price per metric ton is either between $100 and $150 Australian dollars, or greater than $150 Australian dollars. The rate is 7% for coal sold, disposed of, or used below $100 Australian dollars per metric ton. The periodic impact of these royalty rates is dependent upon the volume of metric tons produced at Queensland mining locations and coal prices received for those metric tons. The Queensland Office of State Revenue issues determinations setting out its interpretation of the laws that impose royalties and provide guidance on how royalty rates should be calculated.
New South Wales Royalty. In New South Wales, the royalty applicable to coal is charged as a percentage of the value of production (total revenue less allowable deductions). This is equal to 6.2% for deep underground mines (coal extracted at depths greater than 400 meters below ground surface), 7.2% for underground mines and 8.2% for open-cut mines.
Chinese Foreign Investment and Business Regulations
 
We operate our business in China under a legal regime consisting of the State Council, which is the highest authority of the executive branch of the Chinese central government, and several ministries and agencies under its authority, including the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”), the Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”), the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) and their respective authorized local counterparts.
 
The Chinese government imposes restrictions on the convertibility of the Chinese Renminbi yuan and on the collection and use of foreign currency by Chinese entities. Under current regulations, the Chinese Renminbi yuan is generally convertible for current account transactions, which include dividend distributions, and the import and export of goods and services subject to review and approval by SAFE or its designated foreign exchange bank. However, conversion of Chinese Renminbi yuan into foreign currency and foreign currency into Chinese Renminbi yuan for capital account transactions is under the strict scrutiny of SAFE. According to SAFE Circular [2015] 19 (Circular on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Capital Settlement of Foreign-invested Enterprise) and SAFE Circular [2016] 16 (Circular on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement under the Capital Account), foreign-invested enterprise whose main business is investment may convert foreign currency in a capital account into Chinese Renminbi yuan for equity investment. Other types of foreign-invested enterprises may convert foreign currency in a capital account into Chinese Renminbi yuan for equity investment provided that the enterprise being invested into makes relevant registration with SAFE (or a designated bank) and establishes a settlement payment account.
 
Under current Chinese regulations, foreign-invested enterprises such as our Chinese subsidiaries are required to apply to banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business by SAFE for a Foreign Exchange Registration Certificate for Foreign-Invested Enterprise. With such registration (which is subject to remaining rights and interests, registration with SAFE), a foreign-invested enterprise may open foreign exchange bank accounts at banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business by SAFE and may buy, sell and remit foreign exchange through such banks, subject to documentation and approval requirements. Foreign-invested enterprises are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account transactions and current account transactions. In addition, there are restrictions on the amount of foreign currency that foreign-invested enterprises may retain in such accounts, except that foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange income under current account transactions in its sole discretion.

Also at the time of applying for SAFE registration (including any change registration), foreign-invested enterprises that do not constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to represent that its foreign shareholder is not directly or indirectly held by any Chinese residents; foreign-invested enterprises that constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to disclose the actual controlling person of its foreign shareholder. Any false or misleading representations may result in administrative liabilities imposed on the onshore entities and their legal representatives. If Chinese residents who are beneficial holders of our shares, make, or have previously made, direct or indirect round tripping investments through a SPV which falls within the scope of the registration under the SAFE Circular [2014] 37 (SAFE Circular [2014] 37 Relating to Foreign Exchange Administration of Offshore Investment, Financing and Round tripping Investment by Domestic Residents utilizing Special Purpose Vehicles), the Chinese residents must make foreign exchange registration for their offshore investments, failing which, the Chinese residents may be ordered to return the capital to China and be imposed a fine by SAFE for such misconduct.
 
Failure to comply with the registration procedures, including failure to update its own foreign exchange registration, may result in restrictions on the relevant onshore entity, including restrictions on the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate and restrictions on the capital inflow from the offshore entity, and may also subject relevant Chinese residents to penalties under the Chinese foreign exchange administration regulations. Also, at the time of applying for SAFE registration (including any change registration), the onshore entities that do not constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to represents that its foreign shareholder is not directly or indirectly held by any Chinese residents; the onshore entities that constitute round tripping investment enterprises will be required to disclose the actual controlling person of its foreign shareholder. Any false or misleading representations may result in administrative liabilities imposed on the onshore entities and their legal representatives.
 
Under Chinese regulations, wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. The foreign invested company may not distribute profits until the losses of the previous fiscal years have been made up. Additionally, the foreign invested company shall make allocations of after-tax profits to a reserve fund and a bonus and welfare fund for their employees. In the case of a Sino-foreign equity joint venture, in addition to the reserve fund and the bonus and welfare fund, the company shall also make allocations to a venture expansion fund. In the case of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, the amount to be contributed to the reserve fund shall be no less than 10% of the after-tax profits unless the aggregate amount reaches 50% of the registered capital of the company, at which time the company may stop making allocations to the reserve fund. The amount to be contributed to other funds of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise or any of the above funds of a Sino-foreign equity joint venture may be determined by the board of the company in accordance with the applicable laws. Any amounts to be contributed to such funds shall be set aside prior to distribution of after-tax profit.
