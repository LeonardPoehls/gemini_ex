Company History and Recent Developments
 
Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. (formerly Have Gun Will Travel Entertainment, Inc.) (“ICGL”, “we”, “us” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013. From inception through the date of the Share Exchange as defined below, we were an emerging forward-thinking full-service television pre-production company dedicated to the creation of original concepts and programming with a bold and innovative edge in the reality television space for sale, option and licensure to independent producers, cable television networks, syndication companies, and other entities. On June 11, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada in order to change its name to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. and to increase the authorized shares of common stock from 70,000,000 to 400,000,000 (the “Amendments”). The name change was undertaken in order to more closely align with the operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortune Delight Holdings Group Ltd (“FDHG”). The increase in authorized shares was undertaken to allow the Company to utilize the newly available shares to raise capital. The board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved the Amendments on May 8, 2015.
 
On May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with FDHG and Wu Jun Rui, on behalf of himself and certain other individuals who are to receive shares of ICGL pursuant to the Exchange Agreement (the “Shareholders”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000 shares of FDHG common stock, consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG, to ICGL in exchange for the issuance to the shareholders of 59,620,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $.001 per share and 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. The preferred stock was issued to Mr. Xinyuan Yang. Because the Company’s original articles of incorporation did not specifically designate the preferred stock as “preferred stock,” and did not designate the rights and privileges of the preferred stock, on February 13, 2017 the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada a Certificate of Correction (the “Certificate of Correction”), authorized under Chapter 78.0296 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, which revised the originally filed articles of incorporation of the Company to designate the Additional Shares as preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, which changes were retroactively effective as of the original filing date of the Company’s articles of incorporation. Concurrently with the filing of the Certificate of Correction, the Company also entered into a Stock Settlement and Release Agreement (the “Release Agreement”) with Mr. Yang in which the Company agreed to issue to Mr. Yang 5,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for (i) the transfer to the Company and cancellation of the 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock issued to Mr. Yang in connection with the Exchange Agreement and (ii) an agreement by Mr. Yang to release the Company from any and all liability in connection with prior transactions between the Company and Mr. Yang, including but not limited to the Exchange Agreement.
 
As a result of the closing of the Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. At the closing, FDHD was the parent company of Silver Channel Industrial Ltd., a Hong Kong company. Heyuan Image Machinery Import and Export Co., Ltd., a P.R.C. company, is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Silver Channel Industrial Ltd. (“Silver Channel”). Guangzhou Image Agricultural Technology Ltd., a Guangzhou company (“Guangzhou Image”), is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Heyuan Image Machinery Import and Export Co., Ltd. (“Heiyuan Image”). Guangzhou Image Agricultural Technology Ltd. owns 100% of the capital stock of Yunnan Image Tea Industrial Ltd. (“Yunnan Image”). Through the aforementioned companies, ICGL altered its business plan to manufacture and sell “Image Tea”-branded tea products from its tea garden in Yunnan Province.

On or about November 15, 2016, the Company’s subsidiary FDHG disposed of its ownership in Silver Channel, which include all of the assets and liabilities of Silver Channel, Heiyuan Image, Guangzhou Image, and Yunnan Image (the “Disposition Event”). All of the Company’s substantial operations were conducted through these subsidiaries of FDHG. The disposition was carried out by the sole director of both FDHG and Silver Channel. Following the closing of the Disposition Event, ICGL became a shell company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. The Disposition Event is evidenced by a bought and sold note stamped by the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, which we believe is a legally binding document. Because ICGL does not currently have any substantial operations, we are currently reviewing potential acquisition targets.
 
On February 14, 2017, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (the “ICSML Agreement”) with Image Convenience Store Management Limited, a company registered under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“ICSML”), and Wang Fa Sung, the sole shareholder of ICSML (the “Seller”). Pursuant to the ICSML Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire one share of ICSML, representing 100% of ICSML’s issued and outstanding stock, from the Seller in exchange for the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, after giving effect to a 1-for-100 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) and other transactions provided for in the ICSML Agreement (the “ICSML Exchange”). As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has not yet effected the Reverse Stock Split and has not closed the ICSML Exchange. The closing of the ICSML Exchange was initially expected to occur no later than May 13, 2017, however we anticipate that we will need to amend the ICSML Agreement to postpone closing of the ICSML Exchange.
 
Corporate Structure
 
Prior to the Disposition Event, the Company, through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, was in the business of promoting and distributing its owned branded teas that are grown, harvested, cured, and package in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). The Company products were sold in the PRC for domestic consumption.
 
FDHG is an investment holding company incorporated on January 8, 2015 and is domiciled in the British Virgin Islands. FDHG continues to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICGL.
 
As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, ICGL is a shell company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As a shell company, ICGL does not own substantial operating assets.
 
Our Products, Services and Customers
 
Following the Disposition Event, ICGL is not engaged in the manufacture, marketing and selling of tea products or any other goods or services. We are currently considering corporate acquisition targets. We have identified a number of potential targets and have begun performing initial diligence. With the exception of the ICSML Agreement described above in this Item 1 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not entered into any definitive agreements with any potential investment targets.
Competition
 
We face substantial competition from private equity funds, strategic corporate acquirers, high net worth and ultra high net worth individuals, family wealth offices, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds and any other entities or individuals looking to acquire performing assets in the Asian region. ICGL continues to seek performing assets in the consumer products industry serving the domestic PRC market. We believe that our history of manufacturing, marketing and selling quality tea products in the domestic PRC market provides us with the experience that we need to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the sectors that we seek to enter.

Government and Industry Regulation
 
Consumer products being sold in the PRC are subject to central government regulation as well as provincial government regulation in the provinces in which products are sold. Business and product licenses must be obtained through application to the central, provincial and local governments. Business, company and product registrations are certified on a regular basis and companies must comply with the laws and regulations of the PRC, provincial and local governments and industry agencies.
 
If we enter the health foods and consumer product sectors that we are contemplating, we will be required to comply with applicable hygiene and food safety standards in relation to our production processes. Failure to pass these inspections, or the loss of or failure to renew our licenses and permits, could require us to temporarily or permanently suspend some or all of our production activities, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.
