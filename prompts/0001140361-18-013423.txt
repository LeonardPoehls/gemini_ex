Overview
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company involved in the development of an injectable collagenase clostridium histolyticum for multiple indications. We currently have a development and license agreement with Endo Global Ventures, a Bermuda unlimited liability company (“Endo Global Ventures”), an affiliate of Endo International plc (“Endo”), for injectable collagenase for marketed indications and indications in development. Endo assumed this agreement when Endo acquired Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Auxilium”) on January 29, 2015 (the “Acquisition”). Injectable collagenase clostridium histolyticum is marketed as XIAFLEX® (or Xiapex® in Europe).
 
On August 31, 2011, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Development and License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Auxilium for XIAFLEX. The License Agreement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 1, 2011 as Exhibit 10.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K. Auxilium subsequently assigned the License Agreement to Auxilium Bermuda ULC. As a result of the Acquisition and resulting internal restructuring, the counterparty to the agreement is now Endo Global Ventures.
 
On February 1, 2016, we entered into with Endo the First Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Development and Licensing Agreement (the “Auxilium Agreement”), by and between us and Auxilium, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Endo, to amend certain provisions of the Auxilium Agreement (as amended by the First Amendment, the “License Agreement”). The First Amendment was filed with the SEC on February 5, 2016 as Exhibit 10.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K. The effective date of the First Amendment was January 1, 2016. Pursuant to the First Amendment, we and Endo mutually agreed that in exchange for a $8.25 million lump sum payment, we will not receive future additional mark-up on cost of goods sold for sales by non-affiliated sublicensees of Endo outside of the U.S.; provided, however, that Endo will still be required to pay a mark-up on cost of goods sold for sales made in the “Endo Territory,” which includes sales made in the U.S. and sales made in any other country where Endo sells the product directly or through affiliated sublicensees. We received this $8.25 million lump sum payment in February 2016 and began recognizing this income over time based on sales by non-affiliated sublicensees of Endo outside of the U.S. according to our revenue recognition policy in the second quarter of 2016.
 
Additionally, we agreed that Endo may opt-in early to indications, prior to our submission of a clinical trial report, with our consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. For early opt-ins, Endo will be required to make an opt-in payment of $0.5 million on a per indication basis. For regular opt-ins, following our submission of a clinical trial report, Endo will be required to make an opt-in payment of $0.75 million on a per indication basis.
 
The two marketed indications involving our injectable collagenase are Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease. Prior to the Acquisition, Auxilium had, and after the Acquisition, Endo has, opted-in to the following indications: frozen shoulder, cellulite, canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis and human lipoma. Endo exercised, with our consent, an early opt-in for lateral hip fat and plantar fibromatosis in November 2015. Endo opted-in for human lipoma in July 2016. We manage the development of XIAFLEX for uterine fibroids and initiate the development of XIAFLEX in new potential indications, not licensed by Endo.
 
Endo is currently selling XIAFLEX in the U.S. for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease and has an agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (“Sobi”), pursuant to which Sobi has marketing rights for Xiapex for Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease in Europe and certain Eurasian countries. Sobi is currently selling Xiapex in Europe and certain Eurasian countries for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease. In addition, Endo has an agreement with Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation (“Asahi”) pursuant to which Asahi has the right to commercialize XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease in Japan. Asahi is selling XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture in Japan. Endo is currently distributing XIAFLEX in Canada through Paladin Labs Inc, an operating company of Endo. In December 2016, Endo entered into a new out-licensing agreement with Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Actelion”), pursuant to which Actelion obtained marketing and commercial rights for XIAFLEX in Australia and New Zealand.

Operational Highlights
 
Indications
 
On February 27, 2018, in Endo’s earnings release for the year ended December 31, 2017, Endo noted that it began its Phase 3 clinical trials for XIAFLEX (CCH in development) for the treatment of cellulite and stated “we view this as a major milestone for a new and important growth driver of our Company.”
 
Endo-Marketed Indications
 
Dupuytren’s Contracture. Dupuytren’s contracture is a deforming condition of the hand in which the formation of a collagen cord causes one or more fingers to contract towards the palm. On February 2, 2010, we announced that the FDA had approved XIAFLEX for the treatment of adult Dupuytren’s contracture patients with a palpable cord. Auxilium launched XIAFLEX in March 2010. In May 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, approved a label expansion for XIAFLEX to include the indication of treatment of recurrent contractures. In October 2014, the FDA approved the sBLA for XIAFLEX for the treatment of up to two Dupuytren’s contracture cords in the same hand. The FDA-approved label expansion permits patients with up to two cords to be treated in a single office visit. In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, approved Sobi’s request for label expansion of Xiapex for the treatment of two Dupuytren’s contracture cords concurrently. In July 2014, Asahi successfully submitted an application to the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency, or PMDA, for the potential approval of XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture in Japan. On July 20, 2015, we announced that Asahi received approval for its regulatory application to the PMDA for XIAFLEX for the treatment of patients with Dupuytren’s contracture in Japan and on August 31, 2015, we announced that XIAFLEX had been listed on the Japanese National Health Insurance, or NHI, drug price standard for treatment of patients with Dupuytren’s contracture. The first commercial sale of XIAFLEX by Asahi for the treatment of Dupuytren’s in Japan occurred in September 2015. XIAFLEX and Xiapex are currently approved in the U.S., EU, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan, among other jurisdictions, for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture.
 
Peyronie’s Disease. Peyronie’s disease is characterized by the presence of inelastic collagen on the shaft of the penis. In December 2013, the FDA approved Auxilium’s sBLA for XIAFLEX for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease. This is the first and only FDA-approved biologic therapy indicated for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease in men with a palpable plaque and a curvature of 30 degrees or greater at the start of therapy. In February 2015, the EU Commission approved Sobi’s expansion to market Xiapex for the treatment of adult men with Peyronie’s disease with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at least 30 degrees at the start of therapy. On May 19, 2015, we announced that on May 18, 2015 at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the American Urological Association, or AUA, the AUA presented the first ever treatment guidelines for Peyronie’s disease, recommending the use of XIAFLEX in combination with modeling in patients with stable Peyronie’s disease, penile curvature greater than 30 degrees and less than 90 degrees and intact erectile function. In addition, at the AUA 2015 Annual meeting, Endo presented positive data evaluating the efficacy of XIAFLEX treatment for Peyronie’s disease as well as the impact of Peyronie’s disease on erectile dysfunction and female partners. In October 2015, Xiapex received approval from Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, for the treatment of adult men with Peyronie’s disease with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at least 30 degrees at the start of therapy. XIAFLEX and Xiapex are currently approved in the U.S., EU, Switzerland, Canada and Australia for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease.
 
Indications that Endo has Under Development
 
On November 8, 2016, following the change in Endo management, Endo announced as part of its earnings call that a commercial review is ongoing of the XIAFLEX exercised but non-marketed indications, including frozen shoulder, cellulite, canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis and human lipoma, so that Endo can best prioritize its R&D efforts and determine clinical trial timelines moving forward.
 
Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis). Frozen shoulder is a clinical syndrome of pain and decreased motion in the shoulder joint resulting from inflammation and thickening of the shoulder capsule due to collagen. Auxilium reported positive top-line data in the first quarter of 2013 from its Phase 2a clinical trial of XIAFLEX for the potential treatment of frozen shoulder. In December 2013, Auxilium dosed the first patient in its Phase 2b study of XIAFLEX for the treatment of frozen shoulder. On March 12, 2015, Endo provided an update on the results of the Phase 2b study, which Auxilium had initiated, without releasing all of the data. The data released showed an increased and unexpectedly robust placebo effect in those patients who did not receive XIAFLEX. Endo announced that it plans to initiate another Phase 2b study after a discussion with the FDA scheduled to occur in the first quarter of 2016. No FDA-approved pharmaceutical therapies are currently available for the treatment of frozen shoulder syndrome. We are awaiting an update from Endo’s ongoing commercial review.

Cellulite (Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy). Edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy, commonly known as cellulite, describes a condition, in which lobules of subcutaneous adipose tissue extend into the dermal layer. No FDA-approved pharmaceutical therapies are currently available for the treatment of cellulite. In August 2014, Auxilium announced positive, statistically significant top-line results from the randomized, double-blind Phase 2a study for the treatment of cellulite. The results showed that all three doses of XIAFLEX used in the study, including a low, medium and high dose, demonstrated an improvement in the appearance of cellulite as measured by the trial endpoints of physician and patient-assessed improvements. Endo announced on January 11, 2016 at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, that Endo had a productive meeting with the FDA in December 2015 concerning its cellulite development program. On February 17, 2016, Endo announced the initiation of a Phase 2b trial of XIAFLEX in cellulite. On November 17, 2016, we announced positive, highly statistically significant results from Endo’s Phase 2b study of XIAFLEX in cellulite. Trial subjects receiving XIAFLEX showed statistically significant levels of improvement in the appearance of the cellulite with treatment, as measured by the trial’s primary endpoint (p<0.001), compared to those subjects receiving placebo. XIAFLEX was well-tolerated in the actively treated subjects with most adverse events being mild to moderate in severity, and primarily limited to the local injection area. Endo announced on February 6, 2018 the initiation of two identical Phase 3 randomized evaluation of cellulite reduction by collagenase clostridium histolyticum (“RELEASE”) clinical trials of XIAFLEX for the treatment of cellulite. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled RELEASE studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of XIAFLEX in reducing the appearance of cellulite.
 
Dupuytren’s Disease Nodules. The onset of Dupuytren’s contracture is characterized by the formation of nodules in the palm that are composed primarily of collagen. Thus, the presence of single or multiple nodules in the hand is far more prevalent than the eventual presence of contractures. In December 2014, Auxilium completed a Phase 2a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of XIAFLEX to treat Dupuytren’s disease nodules. The study produced statistically significant results which Endo announced in June 2015. We are awaiting an update from Endo’s ongoing commercial review.
 
Canine Lipoma. In July 2014, we submitted the full study report for Chien-804, a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy of XIAFLEX in canines with benign subcutaneous lipomas, to Auxilium, which resulted in an opt-in payment and potential future milestone and royalty payments from Auxilium. In November 2014, Auxilium exercised its option to expand its rights to XIAFLEX to include the potential treatment of canine lipomas. Endo is responsible for further development of this indication, but has not yet announced its plans for the indication.
 
Lateral Hip Fat. Lateral hip fat accumulation is common among women particularly as they age and it is often very difficult to improve its appearance through exercise and diet alone. Patients frequently avoid exercise and are unable to restrict their caloric intake. In some cases, cyrolipolysis and liposuction are performed to remove the unsightly fat deposits in the lateral hip. Currently, there are no pharmaceutical products that are labeled for use on lateral hip fat in the U.S. In November 2015, with our consent, Endo exercised an early opt-in for XIAFLEX for this potential indication. Endo is responsible for further development of this indication. We are awaiting an update on Endo’s ongoing commercial review.
 
Plantar fibromatosis. Plantar fibromatosis or Ledderhose disease is a medical condition characterized by pain and disability caused by the thickening of the feet’s deep connective tissue resulting in the formation of nodules or cords along the tendons of the foot. Patients with plantar fibromatosis often have Dupuytren’s contracture and adhesive capsulitis. Current treatment options include orthotics and anti-inflammatory drugs in the early stages of the disease, steroid injections and surgery in advanced cases. Currently, there are no pharmaceutical products that are approved for use by the FDA in this indication in the U.S. In November 2015, with our consent, Endo exercised an early opt-in for XIAFLEX for this potential indication. Endo is responsible for further development of this indication. We are awaiting an update on Endo’s ongoing commercial review.

Human Lipoma. Lipomas are encapsulated deposits of benign fatty tumors, often detected as bulges under the skin. In the first quarter of 2014, we announced top-line data from the Phase 2 dose escalation clinical trial of XIAFLEX for the treatment of human lipoma. The primary efficacy outcome of active reduction of the visible surface area of the lipoma as measured by caliper was met, combining all patients (p<0.0001). There were no serious adverse events reported during the trial. In August 2014, we initiated our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of XIAFLEX for human lipoma. In June 2016, we announced positive, statistically significant top-line results from our placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial. This trial, conducted in 19 patients with two or more benign lipomas, met its primary endpoint of reduction in the visible surface area of the target lipomas relative to placebo, as determined by caliper, at six months post injection (and also met all secondary efficacy endpoints). There were no serious adverse events reported during the trial. Endo opted-in for human lipoma in July 2016. We are awaiting an update on Endo’s ongoing commercial review.
 
BioSpecifics-Managed Indications
 
Uterine Fibroids. Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that form on the wall of the uterus that contain large amounts of collagen and are associated with significant co-morbidities. Approximately 200,000 hysterectomies and 30,000 myomectomies are performed annually to treat fibroids. Uterine fibroids have been estimated to result in direct costs of $9.4 billion annually in the U.S., including costs for surgery, hospital admissions, outpatient visits and medications. In October 2014, we announced that a paper titled, “Stiffness of Human Uterine Fibroids is Reduced After Treatment with Purified Clostridial Collagenase due to Collagen Degradation” was presented at the Mechanotransduction in the Reproductive Tract conference hosted by the Campion Fund of the Phyllis and Mark Leppert Foundation for Fertility Research in Durham, North Carolina. The promising preclinical data, resulting from a collaboration with Duke Medicine, showed that highly purified collagenase can reduce the rigidity of human uterine fibroid tissue and potentially shrink uterine fibroid tumors by interrupting the accumulation of poorly aligned and altered collagen. In May 2016, we announced that an article titled, “Loss of Stiffness in Collagen-Rich Uterine Fibroids after Digestion with Purified Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum” was published in the May 2016 issue of American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. The study, led by Dr. Phyllis Leppert, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Duke University School of Medicine, showed reduction in stiffness and demonstrated the benefits of XIAFLEX as a potential non-surgical treatment for uterine fibroid patients.
 
On April 18, 2017, we announced that we had initiated an open-label, dose escalation Phase 1 clinical trial of XIAFLEX for the treatment of uterine fibroids.  Our Phase 1 clinical trial of XIAFLEX for the treatment of uterine fibroids is ongoing and we plan to announce the results in 2018. The study, being conducted at the Department of Gynecology & Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University, is designed to enroll 15 female subjects treated prior to hysterectomy. The primary endpoint of the study will assess the safety and tolerability of a single injection of XIAFLEX directly into the uterine fibroids under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The secondary endpoints will assess symptoms of pain and bleeding, quality of life throughout the study, shrinkage of XIAFLEX treated fibroids in size, increased rates of apoptosis in treated fibroids and a decrease in the collagen content of the treated fibroids.
 
The following sections describe the clinical development and commercialization activities for marketed indications and indications in development.
 
Background on Collagenase
 
Collagenase is the only protease that can hydrolyze the triple helical region of collagen under physiological conditions. The specific substrate collagen comprises approximately one-third of the total protein in mammalian organisms, and it is the main constituent of skin, tendon, and cartilage, as well as the organic component of teeth and bone. The body relies on endogenous collagenase production to remove dead tissue, and collagenase production is an essential biological mechanism, which regulates matrix remodeling and the normal turnover of tissue. The Clostridial collagenase produced by us has a broad specificity towards all types of collagen and is acknowledged as much more efficient than mammalian collagenases. Clostridial collagenase cleaves the collagen molecule at multiple sites along the triple helix whereas the mammalian collagenase is only able to cleave the molecule at a single site along the triple helix.

Collagenase is widely used for cell dispersion for tissue disassociation and cell culture because it does not damage the cell membrane. Since the main component of scar tissue is collagen, collagenase has been used in a variety of clinical investigations to remove scar tissue without surgery. Histological and biochemical studies have shown that the tissue responsible for the deformities associated with Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease is primarily composed of collagen.
 
The two marketed indications involving our injectable collagenase are Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease. Endo has opted-in to develop frozen shoulder, cellulite, canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis and human lipoma. Endo exercised its early opt-in for lateral hip fat and plantar fibromatosis in November 2015 and its opt-in for human lipoma in July 2016. We manage the development of XIAFLEX for uterine fibroids and initiate the development of XIAFLEX in new potential indications, not licensed by Endo.
 
Research and Development of Injectable Collagenase for Multiple Indications
 
On June 3, 2004, we entered into, and later amended, a development and license agreement with Auxilium pursuant to which we granted to Auxilium an exclusive worldwide license to develop, market and sell products containing our injectable collagenase for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture, Peyronie’s disease, frozen shoulder, canine lipoma, cellulite and human lipoma, as well as an exclusive option to develop and license the technology for use in additional indications, such as uterine fibroids, other than dermal formulations labeled for topical administration. We entered into the First Amended and Restated Development and License Agreement on December 11, 2008 in connection with the Development, Commercialization and Supply Agreement, dated December 17, 2008 between an Auxilium subsidiary and Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”). We entered into the License Agreement (the Second Amended and Restated Development and License Agreement) on August 31, 2011. Auxilium then assigned the License Agreement to Auxilium Bermuda ULC. On January 29, 2015 the Acquisition occurred and the License Agreement was assigned to Endo Global Ventures, an affiliate of Endo. We amended the License Agreement once on February 1, 2016.
 
Endo-Marketed Indications
 
Collagenase for Treatment of Dupuytren’s Contracture
 
Dupuytren’s contracture is a deforming condition of the hand in which one or more fingers contract toward the palm, often resulting in physical disability. The onset of Dupuytren’s contracture is characterized by the formation of nodules in the palm that are composed primarily of collagen. As the disease progresses, the collagen nodules begin to form a cord causing the patient’s finger(s) to contract, making it impossible to open the hand fully. Patients often complain about the inability to wash their hands, wear gloves, or grasp some objects. Dupuytren’s contracture is a genetic condition and the incidence of Dupuytren’s contracture is estimated to be between 3% and 9% of the population among adult Caucasians. Dupuytren’s contracture is more common in men than in women, and increases in incidence with age. Well-known individuals with Dupuytren’s contracture include President Ronald Reagan, President George Bush, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
 
XIAFLEX is the only drug approved by the FDA, the EMA and the PMDA for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture. Prior to FDA approval of XIAFLEX, the only proven treatment for Dupuytren’s contracture was surgery.
 
Commercialization of XIAFLEX for Dupuytren’s Contracture in the United States
 
Prior to the Acquisition, Auxilium had been marketing XIAFLEX for the treatment of adult Dupuytren’s contracture patients with a palpable cord since it became available by prescription in March 2010, following Auxilium’s receipt of marketing approval from the FDA. Since the Acquisition, Endo has continued this marketing. The prescribing information for XIAFLEX made available by Auxilium, and now Endo, lists “tendon rupture or other serious injury to the injected extremity,” as well as “pulley rupture, ligament injury, complex regional pain syndrome, sensory abnormality of the hand, and skin laceration (tear),” and one “anaphylactic reaction reported in a post-marketing clinical study in a patient who had previous exposure to XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture” as reported serious adverse reactions to XIAFLEX. The prescribing information for XIAFLEX also states that the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in XIAFLEX clinical trials included swelling of the injected hand, contusion, injection site reaction, injection site hemorrhage, and pain in the treated extremity. The prescribing information notes that adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug may not reflect those observed in practice because such trials “are conducted under widely varying conditions.” As a condition of its approval of XIAFLEX, the FDA and Auxilium had agreed upon a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, program for XIAFLEX, which consists of a communication plan and a medication guide. This REMS program was designed (1) to evaluate and mitigate known and potential risks and serious adverse events; (2) to inform healthcare providers about how to properly inject XIAFLEX and perform finger extension procedures; and (3) to inform patients about the serious risks associated with XIAFLEX. The REMS program is no longer an FDA requirement for Dupuytren’s Contracture only.

In September 2014, Auxilium presented positive safety and efficacy data from the MULTICORD study showing that concurrent injections of XIAFLEX to treat two Dupuytren’s contractures on the same hand reduced fixed flexion contractures and increased range of motion. Delayed manipulation data from the MULTICORD study were also presented which support the ability to vary the time between a XIAFLEX injection and the finger extension procedure from 24, 48 or 72 hours, allowing for greater flexibility for both patients and physicians. Results from the MULTICORD study showed that joints with lower baseline severity showed greater reduction in fixed flexion contractures and higher clinical success rates following concurrent XIAFLEX injections (one injection per treated joint) to two affected joints, compared to those joints with higher baseline severity. Lacerations were more common among patients with more severe pretreatment contractures. A post-hoc analysis of the MULTICORD study examined concurrently treating two affected joints (one injection per treated hand) of the same hand using local anesthesia prior to finger extension, which may result in greater reduction in fixed flexion contractures. Although the risk of skin laceration may be increased with local anesthesia, it was numerically lower when the finger extension was performed at 72 hours as opposed to 24 or 48 hours. All lacerations were treated with wound care or suture placement. Data from an additional study support retreatment of recurrent contractures in joints that were previously treated with XIAFLEX. There were positive outcomes in 85% of retreated joints based on investigator-assessed improvement and patient satisfaction rates. Study results also suggest an improvement in fixed flexion contracture and range of motion in both metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints.
 
In October 2014, the FDA approved the sBLA for XIAFLEX for the treatment of up to two Dupuytren’s contracture cords in the same hand. The FDA-approved label expansion permits patients with up to two cords to be treated in a single office visit. It is estimated that 35-40% of annual surgical procedures involve two cords.
 
In May 2015, the FDA approved a label expansion for XIAFLEX to include the indication of treatment of recurrent contractures. The updated U.S. label for XIAFLEX now includes a long-term, observational study demonstrating the rate of recurrence for up to 5 years after successful treatment with XIAFLEX, and the efficacy and safety of retreatment in patients with recurrent Dupuytren’s contracture. The long-term, observational study (referred to as Study 4 in the product label) evaluated the recurrence of contracture and safety at Year 2 to Year 5 in patients who had received up to 8 single injections of XIAFLEX in a previous open-label or double-blind with open-label extension study. A total of 645 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 30% discontinued the study. Recurrence was assessed in successfully treated joints (i.e., a reduction in contracture to 5 degrees or less 30 days after the last injection of XIAFLEX) and was defined as an increase in joint contracture by at least 20 degrees in the presence of a palpable cord, or the joint underwent medical or surgical intervention primarily to correct a new or worsening Dupuytren’s contracture in that joint. Following successful treatment, the probability of remaining recurrence free was 80% at Year 2 and 50 % at Year 5.
 
The second study (referred to as Study 5 in the product label) evaluated a subset of patients from Study 4 for a joint that was previously successfully treated but had recurrence. Patients in this study received up to 3 injections of XIAFLEX. Of the 91 patients eligible for the study, 52 enrolled. In the study, 65 % of recurrence in the metacarpophalangeal joints (i.e., the knuckle between the hand and the finger) and 45% of recurrence in the proximal interphalangeal joints (i.e., middle joint of a finger) achieved clinical success after retreatment. No new safety signals were identified among subjects who were retreated with XIAFLEX.

In June 2015, the five-year results from the CORDLESS study were announced. CORDLESS was 5-year noninterventional follow-up study to determine long-term efficacy and safety of XIAFLEX treatment for Dupuytren’s contracture. Patients from previous XIAFLEX clinical studies were eligible. Enrolled patients were evaluated annually for contracture and safety at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after their first injection (0.58 mg) of XIAFLEX. In successfully treated joints (≤ 5 degrees contracture following XIAFLEX treatment), recurrence was defined as 20 degrees or greater worsening (relative to day 30 after the last injection) with a palpable cord or any medical/surgical intervention to correct new/worsening contracture. A post hoc analysis was also conducted using a less stringent threshold (≥ 30 degrees worsening) for comparison with criteria historically used to assess surgical treatment. Of 950 eligible patients, 644 enrolled (1,081 treated joints). At year 5, 47% (291 of 623) of successfully treated joints had recurrence (≥ 20 degrees worsening)-39% (178 of 451) of metacarpophalangeal and 66% (113 of 172) of proximal interphalangeal joints. At year 5, 32% (198 of 623) of successfully treated joints had 30° or greater worsening (metacarpophalangeal 26% [119 of 451] and proximal interphalangeal 46% [79 of 172] joints). Of 105 secondary interventions performed in the successfully treated joints, 47% (49 of 105) received fasciectomy, 30% (32 of 105) received additional XIAFLEX, and 23% (24 of 105) received other interventions. One mild adverse event was attributed to XIAFLEX treatment (skin atrophy [decreased ring finger circumference from thinning of Dupuytren tissue]). Antibodies to clostridial type I and/or II collagenase were found in 93% of patients, but over the 5 years of follow-up, this did not correspond to any reported clinical adverse events. Five years after successful XIAFLEX treatment, the overall recurrence rate of 47% was comparable with published recurrence rates after surgical treatments, with one reported long-term treatment-related adverse event. Collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection proved to be an effective and safe treatment for Dupuytren contracture. For those receiving treatment during follow-up, both XIAFLEX and fasciectomy were elected options.
 
Status of Regulatory Approval of XIAFLEX for Dupuytren’s Contracture Outside of the United States
 
Sobi has exclusive rights to commercialize Xiapex for Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease, subject to applicable regulatory approvals, in 28 EU member countries, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, 18 Central Eastern Europe/Commonwealth of Independent countries, including Russia and Turkey, and 22 Middle Eastern & North African countries. Sobi Partner Products, a business unit within Sobi, is primarily responsible for the applicable regulatory, clinical and commercialization activities for Xiapex in Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease in these countries. In November 2015, following the October 2014 U.S. approval of the sBLA for XIAFLEX for treatment of up to two Dupuytren’s contracture cords in the same hand during the same office visit, the EU Commission approved Sobi’s label expansion for Xiapex.
 
In July 2014, Asahi successfully submitted an application to the PMDA for the potential approval of XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture in Japan. In July 2015, Asahi received approval for its regulatory application to the PMDA for XIAFLEX for the treatment of patients with Dupuytren’s contracture in Japan. Asahi has the rights to develop and market XIAFLEX in Japan through an agreement with BioSpecifics’ partner, Endo. In August 2015, XIAFLEX was listed on the Japanese NHI drug price standard for treatment of patients with Dupuytren’s contracture. The first commercial sale of XIAFLEX by Asahi for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture in Japan occurred in September 2015.
 
Endo is currently distributing XIAFLEX in Canada through Paladin Labs Inc. In December 2016, Endo entered into a new out-licensing agreement with Actelion, pursuant to which Actelion obtained marketing and commercial rights for XIAFLEX in Australia and New Zealand.
 
Collagenase for Treatment of Peyronie’s Disease
 
Peyronie’s disease is characterized by the presence of a collagen plaque on the shaft of the penis, which can distort an erection and make intercourse difficult or impossible in advanced cases. In some mild cases, the plaque can resolve spontaneously without medical intervention. In severe cases, the penis can be bent at a 90-degree angle during erection. Significant psychological distress has been noted in patients with Peyronie’s disease who are sexually active. Frequent patient complaints include increased pain, painful erections, palpable plaque, penile deformity, and erectile dysfunction. Patients with Peyronie’s disease have been reported to have an increased likelihood of having Dupuytren’s contracture, frozen shoulder, plantar fibromatosis, knuckle pads, hypertension and diabetes. Peyronie’s disease is a disease with an initial inflammatory component. This inflammatory phase is poorly understood with a somewhat variable disease course and spontaneous resolution occurring in an estimated 20% of cases. After approximately 12 months of disease, the disease is reported to often develop into a more chronic, stable phase. The incidence of Peyronie’s disease is estimated between 3% and 9% of the population; however, the disease is believe to be underdiagnosed and undertreated. (See L.A. Levine Peyronie’s Disease: A Guide to Clinical Management. Humana Press: 10-17, 2007). The cause of Peyronie’s disease is unknown, although some investigators have proposed that it may be due to trauma or an autoimmune component. A number of researchers have suggested that the incidence of Peyronie’s disease has increased due to the use of erectile dysfunction drugs. Based on U.S. historical medical claims data, it is estimated that around 95,000 patients are diagnosed with Peyronie’s disease every year.

Approval by the FDA and the EMA
 
In December 2013, the FDA approved the sBLA submitted by Auxilium for XIAFLEX, an in-office, biologic for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease. This is the first and only FDA-approved biologic therapy indicated for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease in men with a palpable plaque and a curvature of 30 degrees or greater at the start of therapy. In June 2014, Sobi filed with the EMA to expand the label for Xiapex to include the indication of Peyronie’s disease. In February 2015, the EU Commission approved Sobi’s expansion to market Xiapex for the treatment of adult men with Peyronie’s disease with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at least 30 degrees at the start of therapy. In October 2015, Xiapex received approval from Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products for treatment of Peyronie’s disease.
 
The approval by the FDA of Auxilium’s sBLA for XIAFLEX for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease is based on safety and efficacy data from Auxilium’s Phase 3 clinical trials and other controlled and open label clinical studies in which over 1,000 patients with Peyronie’s disease were enrolled and received over 7,400 injections of XIAFLEX. In the two identical Phase 3 double-blind placebo-controlled studies, XIAFLEX demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the co-primary endpoints of penile curvature deformity and patient-reported bother versus placebo. The approved dose of XIAFLEX for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease is 0.58 mg per injection administered into a Peyronie’s plaque. Up to eight injections (four treatment cycles) may be administered in the course of treatment. Also, a penile modeling procedure is recommended after every treatment cycle of two injections in an effort to further disrupt the plaque. If more than one plaque is present, it should be injected into the plaque causing the curvature deformity.
 
The approval by the EU Commission of Sobi’s expansion to market Xiapex for the treatment of adult men with Peyronie’s disease with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at least 30 degrees at the start of therapy is based on safety and efficacy data from two Phase 3 double-blind placebo-controlled studies, IMPRESS I and II (The Investigation for Maximal Peyronie’s Reduction Efficacy and Safety Studies), which evaluated XIAFLEX for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease and reported that 75% of men with Peyronie’s disease treated with XIAFLEX in the IMPRESS pivotal studies had a clinically meaningful improvement in their penile curvature deformity by the end of the trials. These subjects reported an improvement of 25% or greater in penile curvature deformity. The mean reduction in penile curvature deformity for XIAFLEX subjects in IMPRESS I trial was 38 degrees. Under the terms of the Endo Agreement, we will receive a certain percentage of milestone payments that Sobi pays to Endo as well as royalties from net sales of Xiapex for Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease.
 
Auxilium created Auxilium Advantage™ to support access to XIAFLEX and provide a single point of contact for health care providers and patients for help accessing the product. Since the Acquisition, Endo has continued this effort. A REMS for XIAFLEX went into effect after the product first received FDA approval in February 2010 for adults with Dupuytren’s contracture with a palpable cord, and Auxilium further collaborated with the FDA to update the REMS with an Elements to Assure Safe Use, or ETASU, for XIAFLEX for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease in men with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of 30 degrees or greater at the start of therapy. In November 2016, FDA released the REMS for the Dupuytren’s contracture indication only. Now, because of the risks of corporal rupture or other serious penile injury XIAFLEX is only available for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease through a restricted program called the XIAFLEX REMS. Required components of the XIAFLEX REMS Program include the following: (1) Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training in the administration of XIAFLEX treatment for Peyronie’s disease and (2) Healthcare sites must be certified with the program and ensure that XIAFLEX is only dispensed for use by certified prescribers. The serious risks related to XIAFLEX use for treatment of Peyronie’s disease are highlighted in the Boxed Warning within the Full Prescribing Information (the label).
 
Indications that Endo has Under Development
 
On November 8, 2016, following the change in Endo management, Endo announced as part of its earnings call that a commercial review is ongoing of the XIAFLEX exercised but non-marketed indications, including frozen shoulder, cellulite, canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis and human lipoma, so that Endo can best prioritize its R&D efforts and determine clinical trial timelines moving forward. We are awaiting an update on Endo’s ongoing commercial review.

Collagenase for Treatment of Frozen Shoulder Syndrome (Adhesive Capsulitis)
 
Frozen shoulder syndrome is a clinical syndrome of pain and decreased motion in the shoulder joint which results from inflammation and thickening of the shoulder capsule due to collagen. It is estimated to affect 20 to 50 million people worldwide with a slightly higher incidence in women. It is estimated that 300,000 cases of frozen shoulder syndrome are diagnosed annually in the U.S. It typically occurs in adults between the ages of 40-70. It is estimated that 20% of diabetics have frozen shoulder syndrome. No FDA-approved pharmaceutical therapies are currently available for the treatment of frozen shoulder. The most common treatments for frozen shoulder syndrome are longer-term extensive physical therapy, manipulation under anesthesia, corticosteroids and/or arthroscopy, and some drugs are used to manage pain.
Phase 2
 
In the first quarter of 2013, Auxilium reported the top-line results of its Phase 2a study. The Phase 2a study was an open-label, controlled dose-ranging study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of XIAFLEX for the treatment of Stage 2 unilateral idiopathic frozen shoulder in comparison to an exercise-only control group. The study involved 50 adult men and women at 11 sites throughout the U.S. Four cohorts of 10 patients each received up to three ultrasound-guided extraarticular injections of varying doses of XIAFLEX (ranging from 0.29 mg to 0.58 mg in three different volumes; 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 ml), separated by a minimum of 21 days. All patients were instructed to perform home shoulder exercises. The fifth cohort of ten patients received no XIAFLEX injections and only performed home shoulder exercises. The study’s primary endpoint was the change (in degrees) from baseline to the day 92 follow-up in active forward flexion in the affected shoulder compared to the exercise-only cohort. Safety assessments were made during all study visits and immunogenicity testing was performed at screening and day 92.
 
Both the 0.58mg (1ml) and 0.58mg (2ml) dosing arms showed positive, statistically significant improvement from baseline in forward flexion vs. the exercise-only group. The 0.58mg (1ml) dosing arm also showed statistically significant improvement from baseline in shoulder abduction vs. the exercise-only group. Positive trends with improvement in degrees were also seen in other active range of motion, AROM, assessments vs. the exercise-only group. Twenty-nine study patients (72.5%) received three XIAFLEX injections with 5 subjects receiving two injections and 6 subjects receiving one injection only.
 
Patients were also assessed using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, or ASES, Scale for function and pain. Both the 0.58 mg(1ml) and 0.58 mg(2ml) cohort demonstrated statistically significant improvement in pain and function over baseline scores vs. the exercise-only group (p<0.05).
 
Treatment-related adverse events with XIAFLEX were mostly localized bruising, injection site pain and swelling, hematoma, and musculoskeletal pain. All such events resolved without intervention, and are consistent with XIAFLEX use in other approved and potential indications. No subjects discontinued the study due to an adverse event. A shoulder MRI was performed on all patients at screening and day 92. Screening MRIs were performed to exclude the presence of other clinically significant conditions such as concomitant rotator cuff injury. Day 92 MRI evaluations indicated there were no rotator cuff injuries. There were no drug-related serious adverse events reported.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2013, Auxilium reported that it had initiated a Phase 2b double-blind, placebo-controlled study based on positive, statistically significant results in the Phase 2a study. The Phase 2b study evaluated the safety and efficacy of XIAFLEX for the treatment of Stage 2 unilateral idiopathic frozen shoulder. Following the Acquisition, Endo assumed Auxilium’s responsibilities with respect to the Phase 2b trial. Three hundred twenty one adult men and women were enrolled at approximately 35 sites in the U.S. and Australia. Subjects were randomized 3:1 to receive XIAFLEX or placebo and received up to three ultrasound-guided injections of study drug. Each injection was separated by a minimum of 21 days. All subjects also performed home shoulder exercises after the first injection.
 
The primary endpoint of the Phase 2b study was change in degrees from baseline to the day 95 follow-up visit in active forward flexion in the affected shoulder compared to placebo. Patients were assessed using the ASES Scale for function and pain as well as additional patient reported outcome measures. Safety assessments will be made during all study visits and immunogenicity testing was performed at screening and at the end of the study.
 
 15
 

On March 12, 2015, Endo provided an update on the results of the Phase 2b study without releasing all of the data. Endo noted strong drug effect and similar XIAFLEX patient improvements in flexion, shoulder abduction and external and internal rotation seen across both Phase 2a and 2b trials and similar patient improvement in pain seen across both trials. Endo also noted an increased and unexpectedly robust placebo effect in those patients who did not receive XIAFLEX.
 
We are awaiting the results of Endo’s ongoing commercial review.
 
Collagenase for Treatment of Cellulite (Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy)
 
Edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy, commonly known as cellulite, describes a condition in which lobules of subcutaneous adipose tissue extend into the dermal layer. Cellulite can involve the loss of elasticity or shrinking of collagen cords, called septae, that attach the skin to lower layers of muscle. When fat in cellulite prone areas swells and expands, the septae tether the skin, which causes surface dimpling characteristic of cellulite. These changes can visibly affect the shape of the epidermis and resemble an orange peel-like dimpling of the skin. (See Avram, Cellulite: a review of its physiology and treatment, Journal of Cosmetic Laser Therapy 2004; 6: 181-185).
 
Cellulite has been reported to occur in 85-98% (est.) of post-pubertal females and rarely in men, and it is believed to be prevalent in women of all races. (See Avram, Cellulite: a review of its physiology and treatment, Journal of Cosmetic Laser Therapy 2004; 6: 181-185; Khan MH et al. Treatment of cellulite: Part I. Pathophysiology. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2010 Mar;62(3):361-70). Current treatments for cellulite include massage devices, creams, unapproved injectables, laser-based procedures or liposuction. There are no drugs currently approved by the FDA to treat cellulite, and devices cleared by the FDA to treat the condition have varying degrees of success in eliminating cellulite. Cellfina and Cellulaze, the devices of two competitors in the cellulite market, have already received medical device approval. Treatment with XIAFLEX is intended to target and lyse, or break, those collagen tethers with the goal of releasing the skin dimpling and potentially resulting in smoothing of the skin.
 
In January 2013, Auxilium exercised its exclusive opt-in under the License Agreement to expand the field of its license for injectable collagenase to include the potential treatment of adult patients with cellulite. As a result, we received a one-time license fee payment of $0.5 million, a portion of which we paid to the Research Foundation of the State University of New York at Stony Brook pursuant to the terms of our in-licensing agreement described below in the “In-Licensing and Royalty Agreements” section under the heading “Cellulite”. Auxilium’s license was expanded to include an exclusive, worldwide license, subject to the terms of the License Agreement, which includes all research, development, use, commercialization, marketing, sales and distribution rights for injectable collagenase for the potential treatment of cellulite. Endo assumed this expanded license in the Acquisition.
 
In October 2013, Auxilium announced the initiation of its Phase 2a study of XIAFLEX for the treatment of cellulite. The Phase 2a study was a randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose study and enrolled approximately 150 women between the ages of 18 and 45 in the U.S. Each subject received up to three treatment sessions of drug or placebo according to randomization (5 high-dose (0.84mg): 5 mid (0.48mg): 5 low (0.06mg): 3 placebo) and each treatment session was approximately 21 days apart. Up to 12 injections were administered into cellulite dimples during each session across an entire treatment quadrant - left or right buttock or left or right posterior thigh. Only the dimples treated on day 1 were able to be retreated on day 22 (Treatment Session 2) and day 43 (Treatment Session 3) if, in the opinion of the investigator, the dimple continued to be evident. A variable number of dimples were able to be treated within one treatment quadrant. The primary trial endpoint was an investigator and a patient score on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, or GAIS, which is an FDA-recognized scale developed as an assessment of degree of improvement and adapted by Auxilium for use in the cellulite study. Investigators and patients used the respective GAIS to compare a day 1 pretreatment digital image of their cellulite to their treatment results. A score of -1 indicated that the results were “Worse.” A score of 0 indicated “No Change.” A score of +1 indicated “Improved.” A score of +2 indicated “Much Improved” and a score of +3 indicated “Very Much Improved.” Additional study endpoints included Physician and Patient-assessed Composite Responder Analyses.

In August 2014, Auxilium announced positive, statistically significant top-line results from the randomized, double-blind Phase 2a study. The results showed that all three doses of XIAFLEX used in the study, including a low, medium and high dose, demonstrated an improvement in the appearance of cellulite as measured by the trial endpoints of physician and patient-assessed improvements. XIAFLEX was well-tolerated by all dose groups with most adverse events being mild to moderate and primarily limited to the local injection area. Specifically, both the mid and high dose groups of XIAFLEX demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in investigators’ assessments of the appearance of cellulite, as measured by GAIS scores, with a p-value of <0.05 versus placebo, as well as in patients’ assessments of the appearance of cellulite, as measured by GAIS scores, with a p-value of <0.02 versus placebo. Sixty-eight percent of both the mid- and high-dose groups reported being “Satisfied” or “Very Satisfied” with their cellulite treatment, compared to only 34% of placebo patients. Both the mid and high dose groups of XIAFLEX demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the post-hoc composite responder analysis, as measured by combined investigator and patient GAIS scores, with p-values of <0.021 and <0.004, respectively, versus placebo. Eighty-six percent of all related adverse events resolved within 21 days and there was only one serious adverse event in the trial determined to be unrelated to the treatment drug.
 
On February 17, 2016, Endo announced the initiation of a Phase 2b trial of XIAFLEX in cellulite. The Phase 2b trial enrolled 375 women aged 18 years or older in the U.S. Each subject received three treatment sessions of XIAFLEX (0.84 mg / session) or placebo with each treatment session occurring approximately 21 days apart. Twelve injections were administered into cellulite dimples during each session across an entire treatment quadrant - left or right buttock or left or right posterior thigh. At both the outset and conclusion of treatment, cellulite severity was assessed by each patient and clinician using two photonumeric cellulite severity scales developed by Endo and third-party experts and reviewed by the FDA. The scales - the Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PCSS) - are 5-point scales ranging from 0 (no cellulite) to 4 (severe cellulite) that measure improvement in the appearance of cellulite. In addition to the patient and physician assessments, an independent, blinded five-member panel of trained aesthetic clinicians evaluated pre-treatment and end-of-study photo images of patients using the PCSS. The Phase 2b trial’s primary endpoint was the proportion of composite responders at Day 71 defined as subjects with a 2-point improvement in severity from baseline in the clinician-rated PCSS (CR-PCSS) and a 2-point improvement in the patient-rated PCSS (PR-PCSS). Additional endpoints include assessment of patient and clinician satisfaction using the GAIS and change in the Hexsel cellulite severity scale.
 
On November 17, 2016, Endo announced positive results from its Phase 2b trial of XIAFLEX in cellulite. Trial subjects receiving XIAFLEX demonstrated a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of composite investigators’ and patients’ assessments of the appearance of cellulite, as measured by a two-point improvement in both the CR-PCSS and PR-PCSS scores, with a p-value of <0.001 versus placebo. Subjects receiving XIAFLEX demonstrated a highly statistically significant improvement in the composite investigators’ and patients’ assessments of the appearance of cellulite, as measured by a one-point improvement in both the CR-PCSS and PR-PCSS scores, with a p-value of <0.001 versus placebo. A highly significant proportion of XIAFLEX subjects reported being “Satisfied” or “Very Satisfied” with their cellulite treatment, compared to placebo subjects, with a p-value of <0.001. A highly significant proportion of XIAFLEX subjects were reported as “Improved” or “Very Improved” or “Very Much Improved” in global appearance of their cellulite area as assessed by the subjects and investigators, compared to placebo subjects, with a p-value of <0.001. XIAFLEX was well-tolerated by all dose groups with most adverse events (AEs) being mild to moderate and primarily limited to the local injection area; 92 percent of all related AEs were mild to moderate in the XIAFLEX group compared to 96 percent in the placebo group; the most common AEs were expected and included injection site bruising (approximately 75 percent) and injection site pain (approximately 59 percent). XIAFLEX was well-tolerated in the actively treated subjects with most adverse events AEs being mild to moderate in severity, and primarily limited to the local injection area.
 
On February 6, 2018, Endo announced the initiation of two identical Phase 3 RELEASE clinical trials of XIAFLEX for the treatment of cellulite. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled RELEASE studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of XIAFLEX in reducing the appearance of cellulite. The Phase 3 RELEASE studies are expected to enroll 840 women (420 in each trial) aged 18 years or older with moderate to severe cellulite in the United States. Each subject will receive up to three treatment visits of XIAFLEX (0.84 mg / treatment area, two treatment areas per visit) or placebo, with each treatment visit occurring approximately 21 days apart. Twelve injections will be administered into cellulite dimples during each visit across each treatment area – the left and right buttock. At both the outset and conclusion of treatment, cellulite severity will be assessed by each patient and clinician using two validated photonumeric cellulite severity scales developed by Endo and third-party psychometric experts. The primary endpoint is a composite responder analysis demonstrating at least a 2-level composite improvement, independently reported by both patient and clinician on the photonumeric scales of cellulite severity. Key secondary endpoints include the percentage of subjects that experience at least a 1-level or 2-level improvement in patient reported assessment, percentage of subjects with a 1-level composite improvement, percentage of satisfied subjects, change from baseline in a cellulite impact scale, i.e., patients' self-perception related to their cellulite, as well as the percentage of subjects with at least a 1-level or 2-level improvement in the GAIS.

Canine Lipoma
 
Based on the encouraging results reported in the clinical investigations in human lipoma, we began clinical trials in canine lipoma. As many as 1.7 million canines per year are affected with lipomas in the U.S. Lipomas in older canines are very common, and lipomas that restrict motion in older canines are a serious problem. The only proven therapy for this condition is surgical excision of the lipoma, which necessarily involves the use of general anesthesia. There are approximately 1 million lipomas excised each year from dogs in the U.S.
 
Chien-804
 
In December 2013, we announced top-line data from Chien-804, the placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy of XIAFLEX in canines with benign subcutaneous lipomas. The Chien-804 trial enrolled 37 dogs in a single injection study randomized 1:1 XIAFLEX to placebo with lipoma volume being measured by CT scan and lipoma surface area being measured by caliper at baseline, one month and 90 days. The data at 90 days show a post-treatment difference in the mean percent change in lipoma volume by CT scan between the XIAFLEX and placebo-treated groups of -11.58% (p=0.52), which was not statistically significant. The percent change at 90 days in mean visible surface area measured by caliper showed a difference of -44.12% versus 4.0% in the placebo group (p=0.006), which was statistically significant. Among those dogs whose lipomas decreased by 50% or more, the results achieved statistical significance and showed that the visible surface area as measured by caliper decreased by 50% or more in 45.0% of XIAFLEX-treated dogs (9 out of 20) versus 0% of placebo-treated dogs (0 out of 17), with a p-value of 0.0015. A questionnaire administered to pet owners, while blinded to the study, showed 70.0% satisfaction with the results of XIAFLEX treatment versus 23.6% satisfaction with the placebo results (p=0.0027). There were no drug-related serious adverse events reported during the trial. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were local injection site reactions including bruising, injection site swelling, injection site pain and injection site edema. These adverse events are consistent with those seen previously in clinical experience in humans.
 
We provided Auxilium with the Chien-804 final study report in July 2014, which triggered the 120 day opt-in period. In November 2014, Auxilium exercised its option to expand its rights to XIAFLEX to include the potential treatment of canine lipomas. Endo is responsible for further development of this indication, but has not yet announced its plans for the indication.
 
Lateral Hip Fat
 
Lateral hip fat accumulation is common among women particularly as they age and it is often very difficult to improve its appearance through exercise and diet alone. Patients frequently avoid exercise and are unable to restrict their caloric intake. The prevalence of lateral hip fat is similar to the prevalence of cellulite. In some cases, cyrolipolysis and liposuction are performed to remove the unsightly fat deposits in the lateral hip. There are no pharmaceutical products that are labeled for use on lateral hip fat in the U.S. In November 2015, with our consent, Endo exercised an early opt-in for XIAFLEX for this potential indication. Endo is responsible for further development of this indication. We are awaiting the results of Endo’s ongoing commercial review.
 
Plantar fibromatosis
 
Plantar fibromatosis or Ledderhose disease is a medical condition characterized by pain and disability caused by the thickening of the feet’s deep connective tissue resulting in the formation of nodules or cords along the tendons of the foot. Patients with plantar fibromatosis often have Dupuytren’s contracture and adhesive capsulitis. It is estimated that there are approximately 200,000 patients in the U.S. Treatment may include orthotics and anti-inflammatory drugs in the early stages of the disease, steroid injections and surgery in advanced cases. There are no pharmaceutical products that are FDA approved for use in this indication in the U.S. In November 2015, with our consent, Endo exercised an early opt-in for XIAFLEX for this potential indication. Endo is responsible for further development of this indication. We are awaiting the results of Endo’s ongoing commercial review.

Human Lipoma
 
Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that occur as bulges under the skin and affect humans and canines. It is estimated that lipomas are the primary diagnosis in approximately 600,000 human patients in the U.S. annually. The only proven therapy for lipoma treatment is surgery, which is often not practical for patients with multiple lipomas. Twenty percent of patients have multiple lipomas. Based on observations made during preclinical studies that a collagenase injection decreased the size of fat pads in animals, we initiated, monitored and supplied the requisite study drug for a Phase 1 open label clinical trial for the treatment of human lipomas with a single injection of collagenase. Favorable initial results (10 out of 12 patients had a 50-90% reduction in the size of the lipomas) from this trial for the treatment of human lipomas were presented at a meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
 
In January 2014, we announced the top-line data from the Phase 2 dose escalation clinical trial of XIAFLEX for the treatment of human lipoma. This Phase 2 open-label single-center dose escalation study assessed the safety and efficacy of XIAFLEX in 14 patients with lipoma, divided into four dose cohorts. Each patient received a single injection of XIAFLEX in one of four ascending doses based on the current commercial dose of XIAFLEX in marketed indications, ranging from 0.058mg (10% of commercial dose) to 0.44mg (75% of commercial dose). The primary efficacy outcome was a statistically significant (p<0.0001) reduction in lipoma visible surface area as measured by caliper, combining all patients. Data showed patients in the highest dose group (75% of commercial dose) achieved the best efficacy results with an average of 67% reduction of lipoma visible surface area as measured by caliper at six months post-treatment. Additionally, data demonstrated that 75% of patients in the highest dose group achieved reduction of 50% or more in lipoma visible surface area. There were no drug-related serious adverse events reported during the trial. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were localized to the injection site and included bruising, injection site swelling and injection site pain. These adverse events are consistent with those seen previously in clinical experience.
 
In August 2014, we initiated our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of XIAFLEX for the treatment of lipoma. We completed patient enrollment during the fourth quarter of 2015. The study was conducted at two centers in the U.S. and enrolled 18 adult men and women presenting with at least two benign lipomas of similar size. Subjects were randomized to have two lipomas treated in immediate succession; one with XIAFLEX and one with placebo. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 clinical trial is the reduction in the measureable surface area of the target lipomas, as determined by caliper, at six months post injection. The secondary efficacy endpoints include responders at six months post injection who show a ≥50% decrease in lipoma surface area relative to baseline between XIAFLEX and placebo, the change in the length of the target lipoma, the relative change in lipoma surface area as measured by caliper at one month and three months, and the relative change in lipoma volume as measured by MRI. The study also gathered qualitative lipoma characteristics and an assessment of patient satisfaction through a questionnaire administered to each subject prior to injection and at each follow-up visit.
 
In June 2016, we announced positive, statistically significant top-line results from our placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial. This trial, conducted in 19 patients with two or more benign lipomas, met its primary endpoint of reduction in the visible surface area of the target lipomas relative to placebo, as determined by caliper, at six months post injection (and also met all secondary efficacy endpoints). 81.3 percent reduction in the visible surface area for patients who received XIAFLEX compared to a 2.1 percent increase for treatment with placebo in the target lipoma, as measured by caliper at six months post-treatment, resulting in an 83.4 percent difference in favor of XIAFLEX (p˂0.0001). 89.5 percent of XIAFLEX patients (17 of 19 patients) were responders at six months post-injection (showed a ≥50% decrease in lipoma visible surface area relative to baseline) compared to 0 percent for placebo (p˂0.0001). The mean decrease in the length of the target lipoma at 6 months was 64.8 percent from baseline for XIAFLEX treated lipomas and 0.2 percent increase for placebo (p<0.0001). As measured by caliper, the mean decrease in lipoma visible surface area at three months was 62.5 percent for XIAFLEX and 0.4 percent increase for placebo (p<0.0001). As measured by caliper, the mean decrease in lipoma visible surface area at one month was 26.8 percent for XIAFLEX and 0.2 percent increase for placebo (p=0.0042). The mean decrease in lipoma volume as measured by MRI at 6 months was 47.2 percent for XIAFLEX treated lipomas and 4.9 percent for placebo (p=0.0013). Patient satisfaction was assessed through a questionnaire administered to each subject prior to injection and at the one, three and six month follow-up visits. For the lipomas that received XIAFLEX treatment, at six months, 57.9 percent of patients reported being very satisfied; 36.8 were somewhat satisfied and zero were not satisfied verses placebo where 21.1 percent were very satisfied; 15.8 percent were somewhat satisfied and 57.9 percent were not satisfied (p=0.0010 in favor of XIAFLEX). There were no drug-related serious adverse events reported during the trial and XIAFLEX was well-tolerated, with no trial dropouts. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were localized to the injection site and included bruising, injection site swelling/pain and pruritus. These adverse events are consistent with those seen previously in clinical experience.

In August 2016, we announced that Endo opted in to this indication. We are awaiting the results of Endo’s ongoing commercial review.
 
BioSpecifics-Managed Indications
 
Uterine Fibroids
 
Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that form on the wall of the uterus that contain large amounts of collagen and are associated with significant co-morbidities, which can include pain, decreased fertility, pregnancy complications, miscarriage, heavy menstrual bleeding and frequent urination. Uterine fibroids are the primary indication for hysterectomy in the U.S. Approximately 200,000 hysterectomies and 30,000 myomectomies are performed annually to treat fibroids. Uterine fibroids have been estimated to result in direct costs of $9.4 billion annually in the U.S., including costs for surgery, hospital admissions, outpatient visits and medications.
 
In October 2014, we announced that a paper titled, “Stiffness of Human Uterine Fibroids is Reduced After Treatment with Purified Clostridial Collagenase due to Collagen Degradation” was presented at the Mechanotransduction in the Reproductive Tract conference hosted by the Campion Fund of the Phyllis and Mark Leppert Foundation for Fertility Research in Durham, North Carolina. The data presented showed that highly purified collagenase can reduce the rigidity of human uterine fibroid tissue and potentially shrink uterine fibroid tumors by interrupting the accumulation of poorly aligned and altered collagen. Accumulation of collagen in uterine fibroid tumors is thought to contribute to the many morbidities associated with uterine fibroids. The preclinical results were presented by Dr. Friederike Jayes, D.V.M., Ph.D. of Duke Medicine. In the ex vivo study, uterine fibroid tissues from eight patients were injected with 50 microliters of highly purified XIAFLEX at four different dose levels (0-1-2-4 mg/ml), and compared to uninjected tissue as a control. Following incubation (37º C for 0-24-48-72-96 hours), tissue samples were confirmed for high collagen content through Masson-Trichrome staining and tested by rheometry to measure stiffness. Collagen content degradation was evident at all dose levels after 96 hours and collagen fibrils were undetectable under electron microscopy in tissue treated with the highest dose. Treatment with 1 mg/ml caused statistically significant softening after 24 hours to 4005±608 Pa compared to vehicle-injected controls (7416±801 Pa; p<0.007). The 2 and 4 mg/ml treatments resulted in statistically significant decreased stiffness after 24 hours (3145±689 Pa; p<0.0005) and 96 hours (1440±115 Pa; p<0.0005). A statistically significant decrease in stiffness was achieved with all doses and at all-time points.
 
This collaborative study was conducted by researchers at Duke Medicine including Dr. Jayes and Dr. Phyllis Leppert, a Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Professor of Pathology at Duke Medicine with our support.
 
In May 2016, we announced that an article titled, “Loss of Stiffness in Collagen-Rich Uterine Fibroids after Digestion with Purified Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum” was published in the May 2016 issue of American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. The study, led by Dr. Phyllis Leppert, showed reduction in stiffness and demonstrated the benefits of XIAFLEX as a potential non-surgical treatment for uterine fibroid patients.
 
On April 18, 2017, we announced that we had initiated an open-label, dose escalation Phase 1 clinical trial of XIAFLEX for the treatment of uterine fibroids.  Our Phase 1 clinical trial of XIAFLEX for the treatment of uterine fibroids is ongoing and we plan to announce the results in 2018. The study, being conducted at the Department of Gynecology & Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University, is designed to enroll 15 female subjects treated prior to hysterectomy. The primary endpoint of the study will assess the safety and tolerability of a single injection of XIAFLEX directly into the uterine fibroids under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The secondary endpoints will assess symptoms of pain and bleeding, quality of life throughout the study, shrinkage of XIAFLEX treated fibroids in size, increased rates of apoptosis in treated fibroids and a decrease in the collagen content of the treated fibroids.
 
Other Clinical Indications
 
Other clinical indications for which our collagenase injection has been tested include keloids, hypertrophic scars, scarred tendons, glaucoma, herniated intervertebral discs, and as an adjunct to vitrectomy. We are currently evaluating our options for development of additional indications using collagenase.

LICENSING AND MARKETING AGREEMENTS
 
Endo Agreement
 
Under the License Agreement, we granted to Auxilium exclusive worldwide rights to develop, market and sell certain products containing our injectable collagenase. Auxilium subsequently assigned the License Agreement to Auxilium Bermuda ULC. Endo acquired Auxilium on January 29, 2015, and a result of the Acquisition and resulting internal restructuring, the counterparty to the agreement is now Endo Global Ventures. On February 1, 2016, we entered into the First Amendment with Endo Global Ventures.
 
As noted above, on February 1, 2016 we entered into the First Amendment. The First Amendment has an effective date of January 1, 2016. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company and Endo Global Ventures mutually agreed that in exchange for an $8.25 million lump sum payment by Endo Global Ventures to the Company, Endo Global Ventures is no longer required to pay an additional mark-up of cost of goods to the Company for sales by non-affiliated sublicensees of Endo Global Ventures outside of the United States; provided, however, that Endo Global Ventures will still be required to pay a mark-up on cost of goods for sales made in the “Endo Territory”, which will always include sales made in the United States and sales made in any other country where Endo Global Ventures sells the product directly or through affiliated sublicensees. The $8.25 million lump sum payment was received by the Company on February 11, 2016, and will be recognized over time based on sales by non-affiliated sublicensees of Endo Global Ventures outside of the U.S.
 
In addition, pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company and Endo Global Ventures agreed that Endo Global Ventures may opt-in early to indications, prior to the Company’s submission of a clinical trial report, with the Company’s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld (as Endo Global Ventures did previously with the consent of the Company, in the case of lateral hip fat and plantar fibromatosis as documented by a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 6, 2015). For early opt-ins, Endo Global Ventures will be required to make an opt-in payment of $0.5 million on a per indication basis. For regular opt-ins, Endo Global Ventures will be required to make an opt-in payment of $0.75 million on a per indication basis, following the submission of a clinical trial report. Endo has opted-in to the following indications: frozen shoulder, cellulite, canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis and human lipoma.
 
Pursuant to the Endo Agreement, we are entitled to receive certain up-front licensing and sublicensing fees, and milestone, mark-up on cost of goods sold and royalty payments. Through December 31, 2017, Auxilium and Endo have collectively paid us up-front licensing and sublicensing fees and milestone, mark-up on cost of goods sold and royalty payments under the Endo Agreement of $133 million, including Endo’s agreements with Pfizer, Sobi , Asahi and Actelion. In addition to the payments already received by us and to be received by us with respect to the Dupuytren’s contracture indication and Peyronie’s indication, Endo will be obligated to make contingent milestone payments to us, with respect to each of frozen shoulder, cellulite and canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis indications and human lipoma, upon the acceptance of the regulatory filing and upon receipt by Endo, its affiliate or sublicensee of regulatory approval. The remaining contingent milestone payments that may be received, in the aggregate, from Endo in respect of frozen shoulder, cellulite, canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis and human lipoma are $6.0 million.
 
Endo has partnered with Sobi, Asahi and Actelion to commercialize XIAFLEX and Xiapex outside of the United States. Sobi has exclusive rights to commercialize Xiapex for Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease, subject to applicable regulatory approvals, in 28 EU member countries, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, 18 Central Eastern Europe/Commonwealth of Independent countries, including Russia and Turkey, and 22 Middle Eastern & North African countries. Sobi, via its Partner Products business unit, is primarily responsible for the applicable regulatory, and commercialization activities for Xiapex in Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease in these countries. Endo has granted to Asahi the exclusive right to develop and commercialize XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease in Japan. Endo is currently distributing XIAFLEX in Canada through Paladin Labs Inc. In December 2016, Endo entered into a new out-licensing agreement with Actelion, pursuant to which Actelion obtained marketing and commercial rights for XIAFLEX in Australia and New Zealand.
 

 21
 

Pursuant to the Endo Agreement, we will receive a certain percentage of milestone payments that each of Sobi, Asahi and Actelion pays to Endo. We will also receive royalties from net sales in Sobi, Asahi and Actelion territories from Endo, which will be a specified percentage of what Endo receives from Sobi, Asahi and Actelion. To the extent Endo enters into an agreement or agreements related to Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease in other territories, the percentage of sublicense income that Endo would pay us will depend on the territory, the stage of development and approval of XIAFLEX for the particular indication at the time such other agreement or agreements are executed. Pursuant to the First Amendment, BioSpecifics no longer receives a mark-up on COGS for sales made by Endo outside of the U.S. to unaffiliated parties; provided however that if the sale is made outside of the U.S. by Endo directly, Endo is still required to pay us a mark-up on COGS.
 
Endo must pay us on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis a low double digit royalty as a percentage of net sales for products covered by the Endo Agreement and sold in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and certain Eurasian countries and Japan. In the case of products covered by the Endo Agreement and sold in other countries, or the Rest of the World (as defined in the Endo Agreement), Endo must pay us on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis a specified percentage of the royalties it is entitled to receive from a partner or partners with whom it has contracted for such countries. The royalty rate is independent of sales volume and clinical indication in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and certain Eurasian countries and Japan, but is subject to set-off in those other countries and the Rest of the World for certain expenses we owe to Endo relating to certain development and patent costs. In addition, the royalty percentage may be reduced if (i) market share of a competing product exceeds a specified threshold; or (ii) Endo is required to obtain a license from a third party in order to practice our patents without infringing such third party’s patent rights. To date, neither Auxilium nor Endo has paid any royalties to third parties. In addition, if Endo out-licenses to a third party, then we will receive a specified percentage of certain payments made to Endo in consideration of such out-licenses.
 
These royalty obligations extend, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, for the longer of the patent life (including pending patents), the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity period based on orphan drug designation or foreign equivalent thereof or June 3, 2016. Endo may terminate the Endo Agreement upon 90 days prior written notice. If Endo terminates the Endo Agreement other than because of an uncured, material breach by us, all rights revert to us. Pursuant to our August 31, 2011 settlement agreement with Endo, we are now co-owners and two of our employees will be co-inventors of U.S. Patent No. 7,811,560 and any continuations and divisionals thereof. We expect that this patent will expire in July 2028.
 
On top of the payments set forth above, as a result of the First Amendment, Endo must pay to us an amount equal to a specified mark-up of the cost of goods sold for products sold in the Endo Territory, which will always include sales made in the United States and sales made in any other country where Endo Global Ventures sells the product directly or through affiliated sublicensees. Pursuant to the First Amendment, in exchange for the $8.25 million lump sum payment, Endo is no longer required to pay for costs of goods sold for sales within the Partner II Territory or the Japan Territory (as defined in the Endo Agreement).
 
Endo is generally responsible, at its own cost and expense, for developing the formulation and finished dosage form of products and arranging for the clinical supply of products. Endo is generally responsible for all clinical development and regulatory costs for Peyronie’s disease, Dupuytren’s contracture, frozen shoulder, cellulite, canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis, human lipoma and all additional indications for which it exercises its options.
 
A redacted copy of the License Agreement was filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on September 1, 2011. A redacted copy of the First Amendment was filed on Form 8-K with the SEC, on February 5, 2016. The foregoing descriptions of the License Agreement and the First Amendment do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the License Agreement and the First Amendment.
 
In-Licensing and Royalty Agreements
 
We have entered into several in-licensing and royalty agreements with various investigators, universities and other entities throughout the years. It is the policy of the Company not to announce publicly royalty rates for potential future indications under development before commercialization. It is important to emphasize that in-licensing royalty rates vary from indication to indication and it should not be assumed that the in-licensing royalty rates for potential future indications will be the same as those for currently marketed indications.
 
 22
 

Dupuytren’s Disease
 
On November 21, 2006, we entered into a license agreement (the “Dupuytren’s License Agreement”), with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, or the Research Foundation, pursuant to which the Research Foundation granted to us and our affiliates an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense to certain third parties, to know-how owned by the Research Foundation related to the development, manufacture, use or sale of (i) the collagenase enzyme obtained by a fermentation and purification process, the Enzyme, and (ii) all pharmaceutical products containing the Enzyme or injectable collagenase, in each case to the extent it pertains to the treatment and prevention of Dupuytren’s disease.
 
In consideration of the license granted under the Dupuytren’s License Agreement, we agreed to pay to the Research Foundation certain royalties on net sales (if any) of pharmaceutical products containing the Enzyme or injectable collagenase for the treatment and prevention of Dupuytren’s disease, each a Dupuytren’s Licensed Product.
 
Our obligation to pay royalties to the Research Foundation with respect to sales by us, our affiliates or any sublicensee of any Dupuytren’s Licensed Product in any country (including the U.S.) arises only upon the first commercial sale of such Dupuytren’s Licensed Product on a country-by-country basis. The royalty rate is 0.5% of net sales. Our obligation to pay royalties to the Research Foundation will continue until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of a patent pertaining to the Dupuytren’s Licensed Product; (ii) the expiration of the regulatory exclusivity period conveyed by the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development, or the OOPD, with respect to the Dupuytren’s Licensed Product; or (iii) June 3, 2016.
 
Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its termination provisions, the Dupuytren’s License Agreement and the licenses granted under that agreement will continue in effect until the termination of our royalty obligations. After that, all licenses granted to us under the Dupuytren’s License Agreement will become fully paid, irrevocable exclusive licenses.
 
A redacted copy of the Dupuytren’s License Agreement was filed on Form 8-K with the SEC on November 28, 2006. The foregoing descriptions of the Dupuytren’s License Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Dupuytren’s License Agreement.
 
Peyronie’s Disease
 
On August 27, 2008, we entered into an agreement with Dr. Martin K. Gelbard to improve the deal terms related to our future royalty obligations for Peyronie’s disease by buying down our future royalty obligations with a one-time cash payment. On March 31, 2012, we entered into an amendment to this agreement, which enables us to buy down a portion of our future royalty obligations in exchange for an initial cash payment and five additional cash payments. We are currently making the payments to buy down the future royalty obligations, which royalty obligations terminate 5 years after first commercial sale.
 
A redacted copy of the amendment was filed on Form 8-K/A with the SEC on August 8, 2012. The foregoing descriptions of the agreement with Dr. Gelbard and the amendment to that agreement do not comport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of that agreement, as amended.
 
Frozen Shoulder
 
On November 21, 2006, we entered into a license agreement (the “Frozen Shoulder License Agreement”) with the Research Foundation, pursuant to which the Research Foundation granted to us and our affiliates an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense to certain third parties, to know-how owned by the Research Foundation related to the development, manufacture, use or sale of (i) the Enzyme and (ii) all pharmaceutical products containing the Enzyme or injectable collagenase, in each case to the extent it pertains to the treatment and prevention of frozen shoulder.
 
 23
 

Additionally, the Research Foundation granted to us an exclusive license to the patent applications in respect of frozen shoulder. The license granted to us under the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement is subject to the non-exclusive license (with right to sublicense) granted to the U.S. government by the Research Foundation in connection with the U.S. government’s funding of the initial research.
 
In consideration of the license granted under the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement, we agreed to pay to the Research Foundation certain royalties on net sales (if any) of pharmaceutical products containing the Enzyme or injectable collagenase for the treatment and prevention of frozen shoulder, each a Frozen Shoulder Licensed Product. In addition, we and the Research Foundation will share in any milestone payments and sublicense income received by us in respect of the rights licensed under the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement.
 
Our obligation to pay royalties to the Research Foundation with respect to sales by us, our affiliates or any sublicensee of any Frozen Shoulder Licensed Product in any country (including the U.S.) arises only upon the first commercial sale of a Frozen Shoulder Licensed Product. Our obligation to pay royalties to the Research Foundation will continue until, the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of a university patent pertaining to a Frozen Shoulder Licensed Product or (ii) June 3, 2016.
 
Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its termination provisions, the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement and licenses granted under that agreement will continue in effect until the termination of our royalty obligations. After that, all licenses granted to us under the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement will become fully paid, irrevocable exclusive licenses.
 
In connection with the execution of the Dupuytren’s License Agreement and the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement, we made certain up-front payments to the Research Foundation for working on the Dupuytren’s disease and frozen shoulder indications for the Enzyme.
 
A redacted copy of the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement was filed on Form 8-K with the SEC on November 28, 2006. The foregoing descriptions of the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement.
 
Cellulite
 
We have two in-licensing and royalty agreements related to cellulite. One is a license agreement (“Cellulite License Agreement”), with the Research Foundation that we entered into on August 23, 2007. Pursuant to the Cellulite License Agreement, the Research Foundation granted to us and our affiliates an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense to certain third parties, to know-how owned by the Research Foundation related to the manufacture, preparation, formulation, use or development of (i) the Enzyme and (ii) all pharmaceutical products containing the Enzyme, which are made, used and sold for the prevention or treatment of cellulite. Additionally, the Research Foundation granted to us an exclusive license to the patent applications in respect of cellulite. The license granted to us under the Cellulite License Agreement is subject to the non-exclusive license (with right to sublicense) granted to the U.S. government by the Research Foundation in connection with the U.S. government’s funding of the initial research.
 
In consideration of the license granted under the Cellulite License Agreement, we agreed to pay to the Research Foundation certain royalties on net sales (if any) of pharmaceutical products containing the Enzyme, which are made, used and sold for the prevention or treatment of cellulite, each a Cellulite Licensed Product. In addition, we and the Research Foundation will share in any milestone payments and sublicense income received by us in respect of the rights licensed under the Cellulite License Agreement. We paid a portion of the $0.5 million milestone payment we received from Auxilium in respect of its exercise of cellulite as an addition indication under the License Agreement, subject to certain credits for certain up-front payments we made to the Research Foundation.
 
Our obligation to pay royalties to the Research Foundation with respect to sales by us, our affiliates or any sublicensee of any Cellulite Licensed Product in any country (including the U.S.) arises only upon the first commercial sale of a Cellulite Licensed Product. Our obligation to pay royalties to the Research Foundation will continue until, the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of a patent pertaining to a Cellulite Licensed Product or (ii) June 3, 2016. Valid claim is defined only to include an issued specified Research Foundation patent.
 
 24
 

Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its termination provisions, the Cellulite License Agreement and licenses granted under that agreement will continue in effect until the termination of our royalty obligations. After that, all licenses granted to us under the Cellulite License Agreement will become fully paid, irrevocable exclusive licenses.
 
The other in-licensing and royalty agreement we have related to cellulite is a license agreement with Dr. Zachary Gerut that we entered into on March 27, 2010 (the “Gerut License Agreement”). Pursuant to the Gerut License Agreement, Dr. Gerut granted to us and our affiliates an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense to certain third parties to know-how owned by Dr. Gerut related to the manufacture, preparation, formulation, use or development of (i) the Enzyme and (ii) all pharmaceutical products containing the Enzyme or injectable collagenase, in each case to the extent it pertains to the treatment of fat. As the in-license granted in the Gerut License Agreement pertains to the treatment of fat, this in-license also relates to human lipoma and canine lipoma.
 
In consideration of the license granted under the Gerut License Agreement, we agreed to pay to Dr. Gerut certain royalties on net sales (if any) of pharmaceutical products containing the Enzyme which are made, used and sold for the removal or treatment of fat in humans or animals, each a Gerut Licensed Product. In addition, in the event the FDA approves a Gerut Licensed Product, we agreed to make a one-time stock option grant to Dr. Gerut with a strike price equal to the closing trading price on the day before the date of such grant.
 
Our obligation to pay royalties to Dr. Gerut with respect to sales by us, our affiliates or any sublicensee of any Gerut Licensed Product in any country (including the U.S.) arises only upon the first commercial sale of a Gerut Licensed Product. Our obligation to pay royalties to Dr. Gerut will continue until June 3, 2016 or such longer period as we continue to receive royalties for such Gerut Licensed Product.
 
Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its termination provisions, the Gerut License Agreement and licenses granted under that agreement will continue in effect until the termination of our royalty obligations. After that, all licenses granted to us under the Gerut License Agreement will become fully paid, irrevocable exclusive licenses.
 
Redacted copies of the Cellulite License Agreement and the Gerut License Agreement were filed on our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2013. The foregoing descriptions of the Cellulite License Agreement and the Gerut License Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of these agreements.
 
Other Indications
 
We may enter into certain other license and royalty agreements with respect to other indications that we may elect to pursue.
 
COMPETITION
 
We and our licensees face worldwide competition from larger pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions and government agencies that are developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have and may subsequently develop products that are more effective, safer or less costly than any products that we have developed, are developing, or will develop, or that are generic products. Our success will depend on our ability to acquire, develop and commercialize products and our ability to establish and maintain markets for our products that receive marketing approval. Our marketed indication, Peyronie’s disease, currently enjoys Orphan Drug Protection until December 6, 2020. Orphan drug status for Dupuytren’s contracture expired on February 2, 2017. For more information on orphan drug designations, please see the discussion below. We may face greater competition, including from biosimilars, after the expiration of the orphan drug designations and the expiration of the 12 year marketing exclusivity under certain laws as further described below in “Public Health Service Act and Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act”.
 
COST OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
 
During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the company invested $1.2 million dollars and $1.3 million dollars, respectively, in R&D activities.
 
 25
 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, reporting, marketing, import, and export of biopharmaceutical products such as those we and our partners are developing and have developed. In addition, manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products participating in Medicaid and Medicare are required to comply with mandatory price reporting, discount, and rebate requirements, among other requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In the United States, the FDA regulates our and our partners’ products and product candidates as biologics, a drug subset, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Services Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations.
 
Any product labeled for use in humans requires regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety purity, and potency, and must comply with additional regulatory requirements of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries, such as the EMA in Europe and the PMDA in Japan. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, and product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Clinical and preclinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the applicable regulatory standards, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and good laboratory practices, or GLPs, respectively. Various federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations also govern the activities of biopharmaceutical sponsors and manufacturers, including the testing, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, storage, and record-keeping related to such products and their promotion and marketing. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and the compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate or approved products to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Each trial must be conducted under an FDA Investigational New Drug Application, or IND. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, an IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and proposed clinical study protocols among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, notifies the applicant of safety concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
 
In addition to FDA review and supervision, each trial must also be reviewed, approved and conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board, or IRB, and each trial must include the patient’s informed consent. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the effectiveness of the biologic, and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial, and any subsequent protocol amendments, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each study site participating in the clinical trial or a central IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, informed consent forms, and communications to study subjects before a study commences at that site. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, and whether the planned human subject protections are adequate. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRB for approval.
 
 26
 

  Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase sequential process, but the phases may overlap.
 
 
• | Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted in healthy human volunteers or subjects with the target disease or condition and test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, structure‑activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. If possible, Phase 1 trials may also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—Controlled studies are conducted in limited subject populations with a specified disease or condition to evaluate preliminary efficacy, identify optimal dosages, dosage tolerance and schedule, possible adverse effects and safety risks, and expanded evidence of safety.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—These adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials are undertaken in expanded subject populations, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to generate enough data to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk‑benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Typically, two Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for product approval.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



There are typically multiple studies conducted within any given phase to collect the data necessary to support a marketing application. The recently passed 21st Century Cures Act, however, provides for FDA acceptance of new kinds of data such as patient experience data and, for appropriate indications sought through supplemental marketing applications, data summaries.  The FDA may also require, or companies may conduct, additional clinical trials for the same indication after a product is approved, referred to as Phase 4 studies. Moreover, for certain products, FDA may require pediatric studies either before or after product approval, if the product candidate is not eligible for a waiver.  Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies, develop additional chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information, including stability, and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.
 
Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website. Moreover, under the 21st Century Cures Act, manufacturers or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must have a publicly available policy concerning expanded access.
 
In addition to requirements concerning the conduct of clinical and preclinical trials, the manufacture of investigational biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Sponsors of clinical trials must provide FDA annual updates on their development program and more frequent reports in the case of serious adverse events. Investigational biologics and active ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements.
 
Clinical testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA monitors the progress of all clinical trials that are conducted in the U.S. and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. The FDA can also provide specific guidance on the acceptability of protocol design for clinical trials. The FDA, an IRB, we or our partners may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA’s or the IRB’s requirements, the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to the subjects, or based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate. The FDA can also request that additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval. During all clinical trials, physicians monitor the patients to determine effectiveness and/or to observe and report any reactions or other safety risks that may result from use of the product candidate.
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, sponsors submit the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information including information on the chemistry, manufacture and control of the product, to the FDA, in the form of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee, which must be paid at the time of the first submission, if not waived. Orphan products, discussed further below, are not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication.
 
 27
 

Within 60 days of receiving an application, the FDA determines if the application will be considered filed, meaning that it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA does not accept an application for filing, it must be resubmitted with the FDA requested information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe pure and potent and whether the manufacturing methods and controls are adequate. The FDA also will inspect the product manufacturing facilities and selected clinical trial sites. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and GCP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may further refer a BLA to an advisory committee, which is a panel of experts, that recommend whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA aims to complete its review of standard BLAs within ten months from the 60‑day filing date. This timeframe, however, may not be met or may be extended.
 
The FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing, if it determines that the BLA, clinical and pre-clinical trial conduct, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities are acceptable. If the FDA determines that the BLA, clinical or pre-clinical trial conduct, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in a complete response letter, or CRL, indicating that the application is not ready for approval, and will often request additional testing, clinical trials, or information. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either: resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has the goal of reviewing resubmissions in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the BLA.
 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, which may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We or our partners may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our or their efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us or them from marketing our products. Furthermore, the FDA may prevent a sponsor from marketing a product under a label for its desired indications or place other conditions, including restrictive labeling, on distribution as a condition of any approvals, which may impair commercialization of the product. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
If the FDA approves the BLA, the product can be marketed to physicians to prescribe in the U.S. FDA, however, may approve product candidates for fewer or more limited indications or uses than requested, may require significant safety warnings, including black box warnings, contraindications, and precautions, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, surveillance, or other requirements, including REMS, to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must also be conducted at set intervals.  For example, XIAFLEX is subject to a REMS which requires health care provider training and certification, healthcare provider risk education, certification of dispensing pharmacies and health care settings, and patient risk education. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the risks.
 
After approval, the sponsor must comply with a number of post-approval requirements, including delivering periodic reports to the FDA (i.e., annual reports), submitting descriptions of any adverse reactions reported, biological product deviation reporting, and complying with sampling and distribution requirements, including tracking and tracing requirements and suspect and illegitimate product investigation and notification requirements, ensuring products are properly imported and exported, as well as any other requirements set forth in the FDA’s approval (such as REMS and Phase 4 studies). The holder of an approved BLA is further required to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. The holder must also ensure compliance with other FDA requirements including requirements related to manufacturing, recordkeeping, advertising, marketing, promotion, and certain electronic records and signatures.  For instance, the holder must ensure that approved products are not promoted for unapproved uses and are otherwise marketed in accordance with FDA’s promotional requirements.  Improper promotion can subject the holder to significant enforcement by FDA, other regulatory authorities, and private parties.

Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, list their products, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to assess compliance with cGMP which impose procedural and documentation requirements relating to manufacturing, quality assurance and quality control. In some case, after a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. Changes to the manufacturing process are further strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and specifications, and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use.  Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements. The FDA may require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy, including additional studies to evaluate long-term effects. There also are continuing annual program user fee requirements for any approved products.  Orphan products, however, may be exempt from program fees under certain circumstances.
 
In addition to studies requested by the FDA after approval, a sponsor may conduct other trials and studies to explore use of the approved product for treatment of new indications, which require submission of a supplemental or new BLA and FDA approval of the new labeling claims. The purpose of these trials and studies is to broaden the application and use of the product and its acceptance in the medical community.
 
We use, and will continue to use, third party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical quantities. We additionally use third party contract research organizations, clinical trial sites, and outside laboratories to conduct our clinical and preclinical studies. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities, at the facilities of our contract manufacturers and other third parties or at those of our partners that may disrupt production or distribution, disrupt clinical or preclinical studies, or require substantial resources to correct. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in significant regulatory actions. Such actions may include restrictions on a product, studies, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, provision of corrective information, imposition of post‑market requirements including the need for additional testing, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS, product recalls or withdrawals, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, FDA debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment from receiving government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, and result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences.  Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications. Also, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RIGHTS
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our existing products and the products we acquire or in-license by obtaining and maintaining a strong proprietary position both in the U.S. and in other countries. To develop and maintain such a position, we intend to continue relying upon patent protection, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities. In addition, we intend to seek patent protection whenever available for any products or product candidates and related technology we develop or acquire in the future.
Patents
 
We are the assignee or licensee of various U.S. patents, which have received patent protection in various foreign countries. Pursuant to our August 31, 2011 settlement agreement with Auxilium, we are now co-owners and two of our employees will be added as co-inventors of U.S. Patent No. 7,811,560, have been added to a pending continuation, and will be named as co-inventors of any further continuations and divisionals thereof. We expect this patent will expire in July 2028. In addition, we have licenses to other pending patent applications. Although we believe these patent applications, if they issue as patents, will provide a competitive advantage, the scope of the patent positions of pharmaceutical firms involves complex legal, scientific and factual questions and, as such, is generally uncertain. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our current patent applications, or the products or product candidates we develop, acquire or license will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection, will be of any value to us or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by our competitors or otherwise.
 
While we attempt to ensure that our product candidates and the methods we employ to manufacture them do not infringe other parties’ patents and proprietary rights, competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights. Because patent applications in the U.S. and some other jurisdictions can proceed in secrecy until patents issue, third parties may obtain other patents without our knowledge prior to the issuance of patents relating to our product candidates, which they could attempt to assert against us. Also, since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications.
 
Although we believe that our product candidates, production methods and other activities do not currently infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we cannot be certain that a third party will not challenge our position in the future. If a third party alleges that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, we may need to obtain a license from that third party, but there can be no assurance that any such license will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Any infringement claim that results in litigation could result in substantial cost to us and the diversion of management’s attention from our core business. To enforce patents issued, assigned or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of other parties’ proprietary rights, we may also become involved in litigation or in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, which could result in substantial costs to us or an adverse decision as to the priority of our inventions. We may be involved in interference and/or opposition proceedings in the future. We believe there will continue to be litigation in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.
 
We have licensed to Endo our injectable collagenase for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture, Peyronie’s disease, frozen shoulder, cellulite, canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis and human lipoma. We have two use patents in the U.S. covering the enzyme underlying our injectable collagenase, one for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture, which issued from a reissue proceeding in December 2007, and one for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease. The Dupuytren’s patent would have expired in 2014 if were it not for an extension based on regulatory delay discussed below. Because of the extension it has not expired yet, and the Peyronie’s patent expires in 2019. Both the Dupuytren’s and Peyronie’s patents are limited to the use of the enzyme for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease within certain dose ranges. An application to extend the term of the Dupuytren’s patent to August 22, 2019 based upon regulatory delay in granting approval to sell XIAFLEX was filed in the USPTO on April 1, 2010. On July 17, 2015, the USPTO granted the application extending the expiration date to August 24, 2019.
 
 Orphan Drug Designations
 
Two indications, Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease, have received orphan drug designation from the OOPD. These indications did not receive the European equivalent of orphan drug designation.

The orphan drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provide incentives to biologics sponsors to develop and supply products for the treatment of rare diseases, currently defined as diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or, for a disease that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a product for such disease or condition will be recovered from its sales in the U.S. If there is a product already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the already approved product, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity.  Under the orphan regulations the holder of the first FDA approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity for that product for the orphan indication which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. In the case of Dupuytren’s contracture, orphan drug status expired on February 2, 2017; in the case of Peyronie’s Disease, orphan drug status expires on December 6, 2020. Orphan exclusivity would not prevent other products from being approved for the same indication or the same biologic from being approved for different indications. If granted, prior to product approval, orphan designation, companies developing orphan drugs may also be eligible for tax credits for expenses associated with clinical trials including a 20 year tax carry-forward, availability of FDA grants, and advice on design of the clinical development plan. The tax advantages, however, were recently limited in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Public Health Service Act and Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act
 
XIAFLEX is regulated and marketed as a biologic product pursuant to BLAs. Our and our partners’ other product candidates will also be regulated and marketed as biologic products pursuant to a BLA.  XIAFLEX was licensed based on a determination by the FDA of safety, purity, and potency as required under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA. In 2010, Congress enacted the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, as part of the Healthcare Reform Law, which amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated licensure pathway for products deemed to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with FDA-licensed reference biological products as well as protections for reference biologics.
 
Under the BPCIA, a reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure. During this 12 year period, no application for a biosimilar product can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product and FDA may not make a biosimilar product approval effective until the expiration of the 12 years. Not all reference product biologic applications and supplements, however, will qualify for 12 years of exclusivity. For instance, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the twelve year exclusivity period. The BPCIA also includes provisions to protect reference products that have patent protection. The biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether there should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an action for declaratory judgment concerning the patent.
 
Under the BPCIA, following the expiration of a 12-year reference exclusivity period, the FDA may license under section 351(k) of the PHSA a biologic that it determines is biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product. Biosimilarity is defined to mean that the section 351(k) product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the section 351(k) product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. To be considered interchangeable, a product must be biosimilar to the reference product, be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient, and, if administered more than once to an individual, the risks in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the product and its reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch. Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing doctor. Depending on the product, additional periods of regulatory exclusivity may be available.
 
 31
 

Once any reference exclusivity period for our BLA-licensed biologics expires, the FDA may make an approval under section 351(k) of the PHSA for a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our product effective. Licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable product under section 351(k) generally requires less than the full complement of product-specific preclinical and clinical data required for innovator products licensed under section 351(a). The FDA has considerable discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence required to demonstrate biosimilarity and interchangeability.
 
Trade Secrets
 
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
 
It is our policy to require certain employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
