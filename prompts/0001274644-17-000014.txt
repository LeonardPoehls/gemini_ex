Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company targeting acute and chronic orphan liver diseases. Our initial focus is the development and commercialization of a clinical product candidate, OCR-002, in both intravenous, or IV, and oral formulations, for the treatment of acute and chronic hepatic encephalopathy, or HE. HE is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis, or liver failure, marked by mental changes including confusion, impaired motor skills, disorientation in time and space, and, in its more severe form, stupor, coma and even death. Although the exact cause of HE is not completely understood, there is growing evidence that elevated ammonia is a primary driver of HE, and that lowering ammonia may be beneficial to patients suffering from HE. Common causes of liver malfunction leading to elevated ammonia levels and HE include alcoholism, viral hepatitis and autoimmune diseases, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, as well as obesity, Type II diabetes, and acetaminophen overdose. It is estimated that there are between 30 to 35 million individuals in the United States with some form of chronic liver disease, of which approximately 5.5 million have cirrhosis. Of these 5.5 million individuals, approximately 1.5 to 2.0 million are at risk for developing HE. Approximately 200,000 of these individuals are hospitalized with overt HE per year in the United States.
OCR-002 is a novel molecule, ornithine phenylacetate, which functions as an ammonia scavenger and which we believe is the only direct ammonia scavenger currently in clinical development for the treatment and prevention of HE. In January 2017, we announced the top-line results from our exploratory study, STOP-HE, a Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of intravenously-administered OCR-002 in hospitalized patients with HE. The data showed that OCR-002 was both safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels evaluated. Although not statistically significant, OCR-002 demonstrated a 17-hour reduction over placebo (47 versus 64 hours, respectively) for the primary endpoint, which was median time to improvement in HE symptoms, p=0.129, hazard ratio 1.25. In addition, OCR-002 demonstrated a 15-hour reduction over placebo (87 versus 102 hours, respectively) for the secondary endpoint, which was median time to complete response in HE symptoms, p=0.361, hazard ratio 1.16. Notwithstanding that the clinical endpoints did not reach statistical significance, the patients at the higher doses (15 and 20 grams) had greater complete response rates compared to the patients on the lowest dose (10 grams) and those on placebo. In addition, consistent with its mechanism of action and the data we observed in pre-clinical studies, OCR-002 exhibited a statistically significant ammonia reduction over placebo for the study’s pre-specified exploratory endpoint which was time to achieve normal plasma ammonia levels, p=0.028, hazard ratio 1.69. 
In March 2017, we announced data from additional analyses that showed plasma ammonia reduction correlates with clinical improvement. Related to plasma ammonia levels, patients who responded had a greater change in plasma ammonia from baseline than patients who did not respond, (-28.2 and -9.2 µg/mL, respectively), p=0.0006. With regard to clinical improvement, patients on OCR-002 had a higher response rate at 48 hours than placebo, (51 and 37%, respectively), p=0.026. In addition, while not the primary endpoint patient-improvement measure, when patient improvement was measured by the pre-defined endpoint, Physician Overall Treatment Evaluation, a greater proportion of patients on OCR-002 demonstrated improvement over placebo, p=0.026. Rifaximin, although not indicated for hospitalized patients with overt HE, was widely used in the hospital resulting in a significant percentage of study patients having rifaximin concomitantly administered during OCR-002 therapy. Post hoc analysis of the time to improvement in HE symptoms excluding patients who used rifaximin indicates the primary endpoint of the study would have been achieved with high statistical significance, p=0.004. Other study data indicate OCR-002 provided clinical benefit over placebo as observed by improvement in Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, or MELD scores, p=0.051, and improvement in renal function as measured by the change from baseline in Blood Urea Nitrogen, or BUN levels, p=0.04. We currently plan to meet with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for an End-of-Phase 2 meeting to discuss next steps regarding future development for the IV formulation of OCR-002. While we prepare for our meeting with the FDA, we continue to evaluate pathways forward for the continued development of OCR-002.
We are also developing an oral form of OCR-002 with the goal of providing continuity of care for HE patients post discharge in order to prevent subsequent episodes of acute HE. In January 2017, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial with an orally administered liquid formulation of OCR-002 in patients with cirrhosis. In this open-label crossover study, OCR-002 was observed to be safe and well-tolerated with favorable pharmacokinetics, or pK, including absolute bioavailability of greater than 95%. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial with oral formulations of OCR-002 in healthy subjects. This open label, single-dose, five treatment, five-period crossover trial evaluated the pK, safety and tolerability of three prototype, extended-release oral formulations of OCR-002 compared to an immediate release oral solution of OCR-002 and the FDA-approved ammonia-lowering agent, glycerol phenylbutyrate (RAVICTI). Glycerol phenylbutyrate is a pre-pro-drug of phenylacetate, or PAA, a component of OCR-002. The results of this trial demonstrated a robust, extended-release pattern for all three pilot OCR-002 extended-release formulations, with mean plasma phenylacetate concentrations exceeding those achieved with RAVICTI at all time points for at least 12 hours post-dose. In addition, the concentration of 
5

phenylacetylglutamine, or PAGN, the end-product responsible for clearing ammonia, was greater in both plasma and urine for all three OCR-002 extended-release dosage forms than RAVICTI at an approximately equivalent molar PAA dose. We plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial with a tablet formulation of OCR-002 in cirrhotic patients in the first half of 2017.
In February 2015, we announced the preliminary topline results of the second part of a Phase 2a investigator-sponsored trial in Spain, which evaluated an IV formulation of OCR-002 in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with liver cirrhosis. These patients tend to have elevated ammonia levels because they swallow blood, which produces more ammonia as it is digested. In the first part of this trial, a 10-patient open label safety cohort, OCR-002 was shown to lower ammonia when administered as a continuous intravenous infusion of up to 10 grams per 24 hours. The second part of this trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled cohort of 38 patients receiving either 10 grams per 24 hours of OCR-002 or placebo as a continuous intravenous infusion for five days. The data showed that over the first 12 hours of dosing, OCR-002 lowered ammonia by 19.6% compared to 3.2% in the placebo group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The subanalysis by Child-Pugh score showed a statistically significant ammonia decrease in Child-Pugh C treated patients at 36 hours. A statistically significant difference in urinary excretion of ammonia, as measured by PAGN, was observed and OCR-002 demonstrated a favorable safety profile and appeared to be well tolerated. The investigators concluded that 10 grams/day of OCR-002 decreased plasma ammonia after upper gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhotic patients, especially in Child-Pugh C patients, and that higher doses might be required in Child-Pugh A and B patients to increase ammonia elimination.
In November 2016, results from an investigator-sponsored Phase 2a clinical trial conducted by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to evaluate the safety and pK of an IV formulation of OCR-002 in patients with hyperammonemia due to acute liver failure or injury, were presented at the Liver Meeting 2016, the 67th Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease. The Phase 2a study was a multi-center, open-label study, conducted in two cohorts of patients diagnosed with acute liver failure. The study showed that no drug-related serious adverse events were observed and all doses were well tolerated. Therapeutic serum levels of PAA were achieved at infusion rates of OCR-002 20g/24h and resulted in ammonia excretion in urine as PAGN, even in patients with non-oliguric renal failure.
In 2012, we completed Phase 1 pK and safety trials of intravenous OCR-002 in a parallel ascending dose clinical trial of 48 healthy volunteers and 43 stable cirrhotic patients. This study evaluated OCR-002 in doses of up to 60g and infusion rates of up to 40g/4h. No serious adverse events, deaths or discontinuations were reported and infusion rates of ≤10g/4h were associated with fewer adverse effects, including headache, dizziness and nausea, as compared to higher doses and infusion rates. All doses, including the 40g dose, were well tolerated when OCR-002 was given over 24 hours.
Our strategy is to focus clinical development activities on the IV formulation of OCR-002 to treat overt HE in hospitalized patients and on the oral form of OCR-002, which will be directed to chronic care of HE patients. Based on third party analysis of Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, or HCUP, and Medicare data, we estimate that there are approximately 200,000 patients accounting for approximately 260,000 hospitalizations for overt HE in the United States annually. Additional third-party data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, indicate that approximately 60% of patients suffering from HE are hospitalized for over four days. Utilizing this incidence data and a combination of third-party information and market research commissioned by us regarding pricing, we believe the combined annual market potential for intravenous and oral OCR-002 is approximately $1.5 to $2.0 billion in the United States alone. If intravenous OCR-002 is able to reduce the time to clinical improvement, and thereby shorten hospital stay, we believe it has an annual market potential of $600 to $800 million and if the oral formulation can reduce the frequency of overt HE episodes, we believe it has an annual market potential of $900 million to $1.2 billion.
OCR-002 has been granted orphan drug designation and Fast Track status by the FDA for the treatment of hyperammonemia and resultant HE in patients with acute liver failure and acute-on-chronic liver disease. Orphan drug designation is given to a drug candidate intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. OCR-002 has also been granted orphan drug designation in the European Union for the treatment of acute liver failure. Fast Track designation is available for certain new drug products if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
In December 2008, we licensed rights to OCR-002 from UCL Business PLC, an entity affiliated with University College London, or UCL, for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize OCR-002 and related technologies for any use. The agreement was amended in July 2011, February 2013 and July 2015. As consideration for the license, we paid an up-front fee of $1.0 million. We may be required to make future milestone payments to UCL totaling up to $20.0 million upon the achievement of various milestones related to clinical and regulatory events for OCR-002. We may also be required to pay milestone payments totaling up to $35.0 million upon the achievement of various milestones related to future net sales of 
6

OCR-002. We are also obligated to pay tiered royalties in the low to mid-single digits on future net sales of the licensed product candidate.
We are building intellectual property protection of OCR-002. We have exclusively licensed from UCL two patents and one patent application in the United States, and 20 patents and 2 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions (including granted patents in Europe, Japan, China and several other countries), related to OCR-002 composition-of-matter or use in the treatment of HE, all of which expire in 2025. We have also exclusively licensed from UCL one pending international PCT application related to the treatment of diseases associated with hepatic stellate cell activation, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In addition, we exclusively own 4 patents and 1 pending patent application in the United States, and 9 patents and 16 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions (including granted patents in China and Japan), related to specific OCR-002 forms or methods of making OCR-002, which expire in 2030-2031. We also co-own with UCL and have exclusively licensed from UCL one pending application in the United States, and 12 patents and 13 pending applications in foreign jurisdictions (including granted patents in Europe, Japan, China and several other countries), related to the use of OCR-002 for the treatment of portal hypertension or other indications, all of which expire in 2030. We also hold exclusive rights to 2 patents in the United States, and 5 patents and 10 pending applications in foreign jurisdictions, for the manufacture of OCR-002, which expire in 2031-2032. We own two pending international PCT applications related to treating and preventing muscle loss and treating and preventing neuron loss. Finally, we exclusively own two pending patent applications in the United States and two pending international PCT applications related to oral formulations of OCR‑002.
Hepatic Encephalopathy: A Neurocognitive Disorder Related to Elevated Ammonia Levels
HE is a serious neurological disorder that can occur in patients with advanced cirrhosis or acute liver failure. HE is divided into 2 broad categories based on severity: covert and overt. Covert HE has a significant impact on a patient's quality of life, driving performance, and recently has been associated with increased hospitalizations and death. Likewise, overt HE is associated with increased rates of hospitalizations and mortality, and poor quality of life. HE is believed to occur when the brain is exposed to gut-derived toxins normally removed by the healthy liver. While a variety of these toxins may contribute to HE, it is generally believed that ammonia plays a causal role in the disorder. A third-party study published in Hepatology in 2007 showed that higher ammonia levels correlated with greater frequency of HE and elevated intracranial pressure. Additionally, an independent study published in the American Journal of Medicine in 2003 showed that ammonia measurements correlated with the severity of HE in patients. Further evidence of ammonia’s central role in HE is obtained from a paper published in Hepatology in 2013 that showed administration of an ammonia scavenger reduced HE events, as well as ammonia, in patients with known cirrhosis and who had experienced two or more HE events in the six months prior to the study. In addition, we found that there was a statistically significant relationship (p=0.032) between the levels of severity of HE and ammonia in cirrhotic patients in our Phase 2b clinical trial, which we completed in January 2017. The diagnosis of HE requires the presence of impaired liver function and the exclusion of an alternative explanation for the symptoms. Blood tests of ammonia levels may assist in the diagnosis.
Currently, lactulose is the only FDA-approved treatment for patients presenting at the hospital with acute HE. Lactulose is a laxative which helps to eliminate ammonia through the gut. In addition to lactulose, the current standard of care for these patients includes hydration, supportive care and potential off-label use of pharmacologic treatment to suppress the production of ammonia by intestinal bacteria, most commonly through administration of non-absorbable antibiotics. There is inconsistent data on the degree of effectiveness of these agents in treating the acute HE patient.    
Based on third party analysis of HCUP data, we estimate that there are approximately 200,000 patients accounting for approximately 260,000 hospitalizations for overt HE in the United States annually. Additional third-party data from CMS indicates that approximately 60% of patients suffering from HE are hospitalized for over four days.
Overt HE is believed to be caused by the rapid accumulation of ammonia in the blood in patients with a failing liver. As the ammonia crosses the blood brain barrier, it may lead to brain swelling and serious neurocognitive deficit. These patients are generally very sick, and may be stuporous or comatose, and unable to swallow and effectively absorb oral medications. Therefore, we believe it is preferable to treat them with an intravenous, easily administrable agent that can act rapidly and safely. We believe that OCR-002 may be beneficial in managing these patients.
Potential Additional Applications for Ammonia Reduction
There is evidence from pre-clinical models of liver failure that elevated ammonia may also contribute to conditions beyond HE. It has been observed in such models that in addition to elevated ammonia, the animal can also experience elevated pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension), reduced muscle mass and alterations in protein catabolism, swelling of the brain and loss of brain neurons under conditions of hypotension. When dosing OCR-002 to these various animals, we have observed reductions in portal pressure, attenuated loss of muscle mass, attenuated brain swelling and prevented loss of cortical neurons associated with hypotension. In addition, there is preclinical evidence to suggest that elevated ammonia can activate hepatic stellate cells, thereby leading to fibrosis in the liver. Preclinical work in rat models of NASH is underway to ascertain whether intervention with OCR-002 may impact the condition.

OCR-002 Mechanism of Action
OCR-002, which contains ornithine and phenylacetate, appears to have a dual mechanism of action designed to lower ammonia without involvement of the liver, which is damaged or diseased in HE patients.  A preliminary human study conducted by Professor Rajiv Jalan, MD, of UCL, suggested that co-administration of ornithine (delivered as L-ornithine L-aspartate) and phenylacetate (delivered as phenylbutyrate) lowered ammonia levels more than either alone. It is generally believed that ornithine promotes ammonia clearance though the urea cycle. Ornithine is converted to glutamate, which in turn combines with ammonia to create glutamine. Glutamine combines with phenylacetate to form PAGN which is then excreted through the kidneys.
Clinical Development Programs
OCR-002 IV Formulation
Phase 2 Trials
Stop HE Phase 2b Trial
STOP-HE was a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of intravenously-administered OCR-002 in resolving neurocognitive symptoms of acute HE in 231 hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis and elevated serum ammonia (hyperammonemia). Either OCR-002 or placebo was administered to patients intravenously as a continuous infusion for up to five days along with standard of care. The OCR-002 arm was dosed with 10, 15 or 20 grams over 24 hours based on the patient’s degree of liver impairment and modeling of OCR-002 metabolism, in addition to safety considerations in this high-risk patient population.    
We commenced this trial in the fourth quarter of 2013 and enrolled our first patient in January 2014. To increase the pace of enrollment, we amended our trial protocol in March 2014 to broaden the eligible patient selection criteria. In April 2014, we further amended the protocol to increase patient dosage to up to 20 grams per day based on our review of preliminary pK data from our investigator-sponsored trials discussed below. This increased dosage level remained below the maximum tolerated dose of 40 grams per day observed in our Phase 1 trial. In October 2014, we further amended the protocol to broaden enrollment and clarify certain operational aspects of the trial. The trial was conducted at approximately 100 sites primarily in the United States and Europe. The study included a pre-planned interim analysis and in March 2015, an independent data monitoring committee, or DMC, conducted such interim analysis, reporting that the trial was not futile and that there were no clinically significant safety issues of concern. In addition, the DMC recommended that we continue the trial and increase target enrollment from 140 patients to approximately 230 patients.
In January 2017, we announced the top-line results from the trial. The data showed that OCR-002 was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels evaluated. Although not statistically significant, OCR-002 demonstrated a 17-hour reduction over placebo (47 versus 64 hours, respectively) for the primary endpoint, which was median time to improvement in HE symptoms, p=0.129, hazard ratio 1.25. In addition, OCR-002 demonstrated a 15-hour reduction over placebo (87 versus 102 hours, respectively) for the secondary endpoint, which was median time to complete response in HE symptoms, p=0.361, hazard ratio 1.16. Notwithstanding that the clinical endpoints did not reach statistical significance, the patients at the higher doses (15 and 20 grams) had faster clinical improvement and greater complete response rates compared to the patients on the lowest dose (10 grams) and those on placebo. In addition, consistent with its mechanism of action and the data we observed in pre-clinical studies, OCR-002 exhibited a statistically significant ammonia reduction over placebo for the study’s pre-specified exploratory endpoint which was time to achieve normal plasma ammonia levels, p=0.028, hazard ratio 1.69.
The following table summarizes other key findings from the trial:

Plasma Ammonia µmol/L | OCR-002 (Doses) | Placebo | p-value^
-≤10g | 15g | 20g | Total 
Median Change from Baseline to 3 hours post end-of-infusion | -19.3 | -28.4 | -38.9 | -30.8 | -11.8 | 0.017 
Median Change from Baseline in Time Normalized AUC | -15.5 | -24.2 | -28.8 | -22.8 | -4.4 | <0.001


• | Clinical response at 3 hours post end-of-infusion (responder analysis): OCR-002 64%, placebo 55%, p=0.149


• | Overall median time to ICU/hospital discharge for ITT population showed no statistically significant difference, (but at higher doses there was a difference)


• | Fewer deaths occurred in the OCR-002 arm (11) versus placebo (15)

In March 2017, we announced data from additional analyses that showed plasma ammonia reduction correlates with clinical improvement. Related to plasma ammonia levels, patients who responded had a greater change in plasma ammonia from baseline than patients who did not respond, (-28.2 and -9.2 µg/mL, respectively), p=0.0006. With regard to clinical improvement, patients on OCR-002 had a higher response rate at 48 hours than placebo, (51 and 37%, respectively), p=0.026. In addition, while not the primary endpoint patient-improvement measure, when patient improvement was measured by the pre-defined endpoint, Physician Overall Treatment Evaluation, a greater proportion of patients on OCR-002 demonstrated improvement over placebo, p=0.026. Rifaximin, although not indicated for hospitalized patients with overt HE, was widely used in the hospital resulting in a significant percentage of study patients having rifaximin concomitantly administered during OCR-002 therapy. Post hoc analysis of the time to improvement in HE symptoms excluding patients who used rifaximin indicates the primary endpoint of the study would have been achieved with high statistical significance, p=0.004. Other study data indicate OCR-002 provided clinical benefit over placebo as observed by improvement in Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, or MELD scores, p=0.051, and improvement in renal function as measured by the change from baseline in Blood Urea Nitrogen, or BUN levels, p=0.04. We currently plan to meet with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for an End-of-Phase 2 meeting to discuss next steps regarding future development for the IV formulation of OCR-002. 
Investigator Sponsored Phase 2a Trials
Phase 2a Trial in Spain
In February 2015, we announced the preliminary topline results of the second part of a Phase 2a investigator-sponsored trial in Spain, which evaluated OCR-002 in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with liver cirrhosis. These patients tend to have elevated ammonia levels because they swallow blood, which produces more ammonia as it is digested. In the first part of this trial, a 10-patient open label safety cohort, OCR-002 was shown to lower ammonia when administered as a continuous intravenous infusion of up to 10 grams per 24 hours. The second part of this trial, was a randomized, placebo-controlled cohort of 38 patients receiving either 10 grams per 24 hours of OCR-002 or placebo as a continuous intravenous infusion for five days. The data showed that over the first 12 hours of dosing, OCR-002 lowered ammonia by 19.6% compared to 3.2% in the placebo group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The subanalysis by Child-Pugh score showed a statistically significant ammonia decrease in Child-Pugh C treated patients at 36 hours. A statistically significant difference in urinary excretion of ammonia, as measured by PAGN, was observed and OCR-002 demonstrated a favorable safety profile and appeared to be well tolerated. The investigators concluded that 10 grams/day of OCR-002 decreased plasma ammonia after upper gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhotic patients, especially in Child-Pugh C patients, and that higher doses might be required in Child-Pugh A and B patients to increase ammonia elimination. 
Phase 2a NIH Trial
In November 2016, results from an investigator-sponsored Phase 2a clinical trial conducted by NIH to evaluate the safety and pK of OCR-002 in patients with hyperammonemia and HE due to acute liver failure or injury, were presented at the Liver Meeting 2016, the 67th Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease. The Phase 2a study was a multi-center, open-label study, conducted in two cohorts of patients diagnosed with acute liver failure. Patients were treated pursuant to one of four escalating dosing regimens of intravenously-administered OCR-002, which were advanced only after safety and certain pharmacokinetic data were reviewed. Cohort 1 was comprised of affected patients with minimal renal dysfunction (defined as serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL and mean arterial pressure of > 65 mm Hg). Cohort 2 included affected patients with compromised renal function (defined as serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL and < 10 mg/dL with mean arterial pressure of > 65 mm Hg). Dose levels within the four regimens ranged from approximately 3.33 g/24h to 20 g/24h for up to 5 treatment days. 36 of 47 patients enrolled were considered evaluable having completed at least 72 hours of treatment. The study showed that no drug-related serious adverse events were observed and all doses were well tolerated. Therapeutic serum levels of PAA were achieved at infusion rates of OCR-002 20g/24h and resulted in ammonia excretion in urine as PAGN, even in patients with non-oliguric renal failure. In November 2015, the NIH announced preliminary pK data on the first 24 patients in the study and concluded that OCR-002 was safe and well-tolerated at the levels administered, up to 10 grams per 24 hours. A correlation was observed between the doses administered and the drug levels seen in the blood, but even at the 10 gram dose, the investigators deemed the exposure of the drug to be below the desired range.
Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic Trial - Intravenous Formulation
We completed Phase 1 pK and safety trials of intravenous OCR-002 in a parallel ascending dose clinical trial of 48 healthy volunteers and 43 stable cirrhotic patients. This study evaluated OCR-002 in doses of up to 60g and infusion rates of up to 40g/4h. No serious adverse events, deaths or discontinuations were reported and infusion rates of ≤10g/4h were associated with fewer adverse effects, including headache, dizziness and nausea, as compared to higher doses and infusion rates. All doses, including the 40g dose, were well tolerated when OCR-002 was given over 24 hours.

Pre-clinical Studies
Pre-clinical studies of OCR-002 were performed in two animal models, rat with bile duct ligation as a model for chronic liver disease and pig with hepatic artery ligation as a model for acute liver failure. In the rat model, OCR-002 significantly reduced arterial ammonia and cerebral edema, and in the pig model, OCR-002 significantly attenuated arterial ammonia, extracellular brain ammonia and intracranial pressure.
OCR-002 Oral Formulation
Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic Trial - Oral Prototype Formulations
Phase 1 Trial in Cirrhotic Patients
In January 2017, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial with orally administered liquid formulation of OCR-002 in patients with cirrhosis. The Phase 1 trial was an open-label, crossover study to determine the pK and the absolute oral bioavailability of OCR-002 in patients with varying degrees of cirrhosis. The study evaluated a single 5g dose of IV OCR-002, and single 5g doses of a liquid oral solution of OCR-002 administered across three treatment arms:

• | Fasted while on routine lactulose dosing;


• | Fed while on routine lactulose dosing; and


• | Fasted with discontinuation of lactulose on the evening before dosing.

OCR-002 was observed to be safe and well-tolerated across all treatment arms with favorable pK, including absolute bioavailability of greater than 95% in the fasted state. Dosing under fed conditions delayed absorption slightly, lowered mean maximum concentration, or Cmax, by 30-40% and reduced the absolute oral bioavailability to 75-80%. These data suggest the drug is potentially suitable to be taken conveniently at mealtime corresponding with when ammonia levels typically begin to rise in patients with HE. Plasma levels of the study drug and PAGN were similar when OCR-002 was dosed before and after the discontinuation of lactulose, indicating the study drug may be unaffected by its concomitant use. PAGN is the molecule formed from the combination of study drug with serum ammonia, and is excreted through the kidneys. Overall mean plasma exposure to study drug (AUC0-inf) was approximately 35-40% higher in Child-Pugh C patients compared to Child-Pugh A patients, as expected given the greater impairment of liver function of Child-Pugh C patients. We believe that the higher plasma exposure is due to lower metabolism of the study drug by the severely impaired livers.
Phase 1 Trial in Healthy Patients
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial with oral formulations of OCR-002 in healthy subjects. This open label, single-dose, five treatment, five-period crossover trial evaluated the pK safety and tolerability of three prototype, extended-release oral formulations of OCR-002 compared to an immediate release oral solution of OCR-002 and the FDA-approved ammonia-lowering agent, glycerol phenylbutyrate (RAVICTI). Glycerol phenylbutyrate is a pre-pro-drug of phenylacetate, or PAA, a component of OCR-002. The results of this trial demonstrated a robust, extended-release pattern for all three pilot OCR-002 extended-release formulations, with mean plasma phenylacetate concentrations exceeding those achieved with RAVICTI at all time points. The mean Cmax of plasma PAA from the three pilot OCR-002 extended-release formulations ranged from approximately 50 to 90µg/mL occurring at various time points over four to nine hours after dosing. For comparison, RAVICTI produced a mean plasma PAA Cmax of approximately 10µg/mL at four to six hours after dosing. In addition, plasma and urinary PAGN concentrations were greater for all three OCR-002 extended-release dosage forms than with RAVICTI. The mean Cmax of plasma PAGN from the pilot extended-release formulations of OCR-002 ranged from approximately 30 to 45µg/mL occurring at various time points over four to ten hours after dosing. For comparison, RAVICTI produced a mean plasma PAGN Cmax of about 20 to 25µg/mL at approximately five hours.
Based on the strength of these results and the prior clinical proof of concept established with RAVICTI in preventing recurrent HE in patients suffering from liver cirrhosis and a prior history of HE, we plan to continue development of oral OCR-002. We plan to initiate a Phase 2a study with a tablet formulation of OCR-002 in the first half of 2017.
Pre-clinical Studies
Pre-clinical studies of oral formulations of OCR-002 were conducted in both in vitro and in vivo models. As these oral formulations of OCR-002 contain the same active ingredient as our intravenous formulation of OCR-002, we did not base our testing on measures of reducing ammonia. Rather, our focus was to identify an appropriate pharmacokinetic profile that would support a convenient dosing schedule.
Manufacturing
We currently have no manufacturing facilities. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce bulk drug substance and drug products required for commercial use and for our clinical trials.

We have had clinical supplies of OCR-002 drug substance manufactured for us by Helsinn Chemicals SA in Switzerland and we plan to have further clinical and potentially commercial supply of OCR-002 drug substance manufactured for us by Evonik in France. Finished product manufacturing and filling for OCR-002 IV clinical supplies has been undertaken by AAI Pharma Service Corp in North Carolina. We rely on additional third-parties for manufacturing our research stage oral formulation prototypes. Our third-party manufacturers, their facilities and all lots of drug substance and drug products are required to be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements and FDA satisfaction before any product is approved for the US market and before we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of our products. Contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.
Competition
We face competition from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, among others, which may in the future develop products to treat HE. Our commercial opportunity may be reduced significantly if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, more convenient, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than OCR-002. Public announcements regarding the development of competing drugs could adversely affect the commercial potential of OCR-002.
Currently there is no cure for HE other than liver transplantation, which is limited by donor availability and patient eligibility. For treatment of overt HE, the standard of care is treatment with hydration and lactulose. While Ammonul is an ammonia scavenger approved for use in treating hyperammonemia for patients with urea cycle disorders, it has not been adequately tested as treatment for HE and is therefore not approved for patients with HE. In addition, Ammonul contains a significant amount of sodium, and its package label advises that in patients who suffer from severe renal insufficiency or other disorders of sodium retention and edema that the drug should be used with great care, if at all. Acutely ill patients with advanced cirrhosis and HE can have renal insufficiency and fluid overload and we believe may not be suitable candidates for receiving Ammonul. For prevention of recurring HE, lactulose and rifaximin are the only FDA-approved therapies for reducing the risk of episodic HE recurrence. RAVICTI, an orally administered ammonia scavenger approved for urea cycle disorders, was shown to prevent recurrent HE in Phase 2 clinical testing, and while not an immediate competitive threat, could become a threat in the future if this drug resumes testing in HE. To be commercially viable in the treatment of overt HE, we must demonstrate that intravenous OCR-002, an ammonia scavenger that does not contain sodium, shortens the time to meaningful clinical improvement or provides a meaningful economic benefit inside the hospital. To be viable in the chronic treatment of HE, oral OCR-002 must be deliverable in a practical and competitive dosage form as well as offering sufficient efficacy and tolerability. If a curative treatment for HE is developed other than liver transplantation, OCR-002 may become obsolete for that indication.
Intellectual Property
We are seeking patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products and product candidates. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights developed internally and by our licensor UCL to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of the existing patents upon which our product candidates rely or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. We also rely on trade secrets to protect our product candidates. Our commercial success also depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Our success depends in part on our ability to:

• | obtain and maintain proprietary and marketing exclusivity rights for OCR-002;


• | preserve trade secrets;


• | prevent third parties from infringing upon the proprietary rights; and

11


• | operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties, both in the United States and internationally.

We are building intellectual property protection of OCR-002. We have exclusively licensed from UCL two patents and one patent application in the United States, and 20 patents and 2 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions (including granted patents in Europe, Japan, China and several other countries), related to OCR-002 composition-of-matter or use in the treatment of HE, all of which expire in 2025. We have also exclusively licensed from UCL one pending international PCT application related to the treatment of diseases associated with hepatic stellate cell activation, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In addition, we exclusively own 4 patents and 1 pending patent application in the United States, and 9 patents and 16 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions (including granted patents in China and Japan), related to specific OCR-002 forms or methods of making OCR-002, which expire in 2030-2031. We also co-own with UCL and have exclusively licensed from UCL one pending application in the United States, and 12 patents and 13 pending applications in foreign jurisdictions (including granted patents in Europe, Japan, China and several other countries), related to the use of OCR-002 for the treatment of portal hypertension or other indications, all of which expire in 2030. We also hold exclusive rights to 2 patents in the United States, and 5 patents and 10 pending applications in foreign jurisdictions, for the manufacture of OCR-002, which expire in 2031-2032. We own two pending international PCT applications related to treating and preventing muscle loss and treating and preventing neuron loss. Finally, we exclusively own two pending patent applications in the United States and two pending international PCT applications related to oral formulations of OCR‑002. However, there is a significant risk that the pending applications will not issue as patents, or that they may issue with substantially narrower claims than those that are currently sought.
We also protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
The United States patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications. A non-provisional patent application is examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability. A provisional patent application is not examined for patentability, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date. As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent. The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application. Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an earlier filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent's term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment or PTA, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent. In view of a recent court decision, the USPTO is under greater scrutiny regarding its calculations where the USPTO erred in calculating the patent term adjustment for the patents in question denying the patentee a portion of the patent term to which it was entitled. Alternatively, a patent's term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent.
The effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention. If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application. As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may supersede information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, or PTE, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a PTE of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the PTE is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when OCR-002 or any future product candidates we may develop receive FDA or other regulatory approval, we expect to apply for PTEs on patents covering those products. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of OCR-002 or any future product candidates we may develop, one or more of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term restoration.

Regulatory Matters
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, of a clinical hold on trials, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, withdrawal of an approval, warning or untitled letters, voluntary product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products.
The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of OCR-002 or any future product candidates or approval of new disease indications or label changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
Marketing Approval
The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | nonclinical laboratory and animal tests;


• | submission of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses;


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites; and


• | FDA approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, which must occur before a drug can be marketed or sold.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any new approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis if at all.
Our planned clinical trials for our product candidates may not begin or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:

• | obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;


• | reaching agreement with third-party clinical trial sites and their subsequent performance in conducting accurate and reliable studies on a timely basis; 


• | obtaining IRB approval to conduct a trial at a prospective site;


• | nonclinical laboratory and animal tests;


• | recruiting patients to participate in a trial; and


• | supply of the drug.

Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, an initial IND application must be submitted to the FDA. The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial. In such case, the IND application sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND application must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed consent must also be obtained from each trial subject. Regulatory authorities, an IRB or the sponsor, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
13

For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in phases that may overlap:

• | Phase 1 - the drug is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. These studies may also gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.


• | Phase 2 - studies are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.


• | Phase 3 - when Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the product appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 studies, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the FDA.


• | Phase 4 - post-marketing studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA also now has express statutory authority to require post-market clinical studies to address safety issues.

All of these trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice requirements in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.
Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates or new drugs for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approvals for any future product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
The NDA Approval Process
In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators.
The FDA will initially review the NDA for completeness before it accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Based on pivotal Phase 3 trial results submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant a priority review designation to a product, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months, rather than the standard ten months. Priority review is given where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products or offers a therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
14

After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the drug will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the NDA will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
The testing and approval process for a drug requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and this process may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-market studies to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency.
Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution, or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action.
FDA Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for record-keeping and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain quality processes, manufacturing controls and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that the product is safe, has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics that it purports to have. Certain states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, fail to approve any NDA or other application, request that we recall a drug from distribution, shut down manufacturing operations or withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug. Noncompliance with cGMP or other requirements can result in issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures and injunctive action.
Labeling, Marketing and Promotion
The FDA closely regulates the labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs. While doctors are free to prescribe any drug approved by the FDA for any use, a company can only make claims relating to safety and efficacy of a drug that are consistent with FDA approval, and the company is allowed to actively market a drug only for the particular use and treatment approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions and potential civil and criminal penalties. Government regulators recently have increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs.
15

Orphan Designation and Fast Track Status
OCR-002 received orphan designation for the treatment of hyperammonemia and resultant HE in patients with acute liver failure or acute-on-chronic liver disease. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the applicant, as well as the name of the therapeutic agent and its designated orphan use, are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Generally, if a drug that receives orphan designation is approved for the orphan indication, it receives orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active chemical entity for the same indication. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if the new drug is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or provides a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with the orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. More than one product may also be approved by the FDA for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. As a result, even though OCR-002 has received orphan designation, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active chemical entity for use in treating the same indication or disease covered by OCR-002, which could create a more competitive market for us.
Orphan designation for OCR-002 for HE was granted based on data demonstrating that this disease affects fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States.    
OCR-002 has also received Fast Track status from the FDA. Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. The purpose is to get important new drugs to the patient earlier.
Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws
In the United States, in addition to the FDA, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended, the False Claims Act, as amended, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
As noted above, in the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with physicians might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us. Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding 
16

information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781 and $21,563 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, a similar federal requirement has required manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the PPACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

• | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic products from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended-release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. PPACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefit. In addition, PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.


• | In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to United States government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. The PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.


• | PPACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic products to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap.


• | PPACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.

17


• | PPACA will require pharmaceutical manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers of products reimbursable by federal healthcare programs are required to report this information to CMS annually, and CMS posts this information on its website.


• | A new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to PPACA to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.


• | PPACA authorized the creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board with the authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs.


• | PPACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.

Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the PPACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the PPACA that are repealed. Thus, the full impact of the PPACA, or any law replacing elements of it, on our business remains unclear.    
Privacy
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as an entity that performs certain functions that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
In addition to HIPAA and HITECH, other federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Various foreign countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Research and Development
We devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing new product candidates. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we expended approximately $16.1 million, $16.0 million, and $14.9 million, respectively, on research and development activities.
