Item 1. Business
Transaction to Combine Xerox and Fuji Xerox
On January 31, 2018, Xerox entered into a Redemption Agreement with FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, a Japanese company (“Fujifilm”), and Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd, a Japanese company in which Xerox indirectly holds a 25 percent equity interest and Fujifilm holds the remaining 75 percent equity interest (“Fuji Xerox”) (the “Redemption Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Fuji Xerox shall redeem for cash most or all of Fujifilm’s 75 percent equity interest in Fuji Xerox and (ii) Fuji Xerox shall become an indirect majority or wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox (the “Redemption”). The combined company resulting from the Fujifilm Transactions (as defined below) shall hereinafter be referred to as “New Fuji Xerox”.
Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Redemption Agreement, Xerox entered into a Share Subscription Agreement with Fujifilm (the “Subscription Agreement” and together with the Redemption Agreement, the “Fujifilm Transaction Agreements”), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Fujifilm shall subscribe for and purchase from Xerox, and Xerox shall issue to Fujifilm, a number of shares of common capital stock of Xerox (and after Closing, of New Fuji Xerox, “Common Stock”) representing 50.1 percent of (i) the aggregate number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (excluding any performance shares issued under the Company’s existing employee incentive plans) plus (ii) such additional shares of Common Stock that would be issued and outstanding assuming the exercise of in-the-money options as of 5:00 p.m. New York time two business days prior to closing of the Fujifilm Transactions (as defined below) (the “Closing”) plus (iii) any shares of Common Stock reserved for issue relating to restricted stock units outstanding as of the Closing that are fully vested as of 5:00 p.m. New York time two business days prior to the Closing (collectively, the “Fully Diluted Capital Stock”) of Xerox in exchange for (A) cash and (B) all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Fuji Xerox not held by Xerox or its wholly owned subsidiaries and (ii) Xerox shall become a direct, majority owned subsidiary of Fujifilm (the “Issuance” and together with the Redemption, the “Fujifilm Transactions”). In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement, at Closing, an aggregate number of shares equal to the “True-Up Shares” (as defined in the Subscription Agreement) shall be held in escrow and released to Fujifilm as and if necessary for Fujifilm to maintain its ownership percentage. 
In connection with the Fujifilm Transactions, Xerox expects to pay a special pro rata cash dividend to its shareholders in an amount equal to $2.5 billion in the aggregate (the “Special Dividend”), which is expected to be financed through the issuance of debt that will be incurred by New Fuji Xerox. Fujifilm will not be a shareholder of Xerox as of the record date for the Special Dividend and therefore will not receive any payment in respect thereof.
As noted above, immediately following the Closing, Fujifilm is expected to own approximately 50.1 percent of the Fully Diluted Capital Stock of New Fuji Xerox and Xerox shareholders are expected to own approximately 49.9 percent. Further, pursuant to that certain Shareholders Agreement, to be entered into by Xerox and Fujifilm at Closing (the “Shareholders Agreement”), the Board of Directors of New Fuji Xerox will have twelve directors, which will initially be composed of seven individuals designated by Fujifilm and five individuals from among the members of the Board of Directors of the Company immediately prior to Closing designated by Xerox in consultation with and subject to reasonable approved by Fujifilm. Accordingly, the Fujifilm Transactions are expected to be accounted for as a reverse acquisition.
Xerox must pay to Fujifilm a $183 million termination fee in the event that the Subscription Agreement is terminated (i) by either party because the applicable shareholder approvals are not obtained if an alternative acquisition proposal is publicly announced prior to the Xerox shareholder meeting duly called for the purpose of obtaining the applicable shareholder approvals and Xerox enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or otherwise consummates, an alternative acquisition proposal within 12 months after the termination of the Subscription Agreement; (ii) by Fujifilm (A) in connection with a material and intentional breach by Xerox of its non-solicitation obligations resulting in a third party making an alternate acquisition proposal that is reasonably likely to materially interfere with the Fujifilm Transactions or (B) following a change in the recommendation by the Board of Directors of Xerox; or (iii) by Xerox in order to enter into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to a superior proposal, in each case as set forth in, and subject to the conditions of, the Fujifilm Transaction Agreements.
We expect the Fujifilm Transactions, which require Xerox shareholder approval, to close in the second half of 2018 subject to customary regulatory approvals, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, tax considerations, and securing any necessary financing. Until the combination is complete, each of Xerox, Fuji Xerox and Fujifilm will continue to be separate, independent organizations and will operate as usual.

Company Separation
On December 31, 2016, Xerox Corporation completed the Separation of its Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) business from its Document Technology and Document Outsourcing (DT/DO) business (the “Separation”). The Separation was accomplished through the transfer of the BPO business into a new legal entity, Conduent Incorporated (“Conduent”), and then distributing one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding common stock of Conduent to Xerox Corporation stockholders (the “Distribution”). 
As a result of the Separation and Distribution, the BPO business is presented as discontinued operations and, as such, has been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, continuing operations represents the ongoing DT/DO business. Refer to Note 5 - Divestitures for additional information regarding discontinued operations.
Our Business

We operate in a market estimated at approximately $85 billion(1). Our primary offerings span three main areas: Managed Document Services, Workplace Solutions and Graphic Communications. Our Managed Document Services offerings help customers, ranging from small businesses to global enterprises, optimize their printing and related document workflow and business processes. Xerox led the establishment of this expanding market and continues as the industry leader. Our Workplace Solutions and Graphic Communications products and solutions support the work processes of our customers by providing them with efficient and cost effective printing and workflow solutions.
 _____________
(1) Market estimates are derived from third-party forecasts produced by firms such as International Data Corporation (IDC).
Our Strategy and Business Model
Our strategy is to increase our participation in the growth areas of our industry while maintaining leadership in the more mature areas through innovation in digital print technology and services. Our Strategic Transformation program (see: Accelerate Productivity and Cost Initiatives through Strategic Transformation section below) is intended to enable us to make investments to improve our revenue trajectory while expanding our margins. Our post-sale business model enables us to deliver sustainable cash flows. We believe the combination of an improving revenue trajectory along with expanding operating margins and strong cash flow will enable us to deliver positive shareholder returns over time. To accomplish this, we focus on the following areas:
Maintain Leadership and Focus on Strategic Growth Areas
We are a leader in our industry and have a strong and valuable global brand. We systematically evaluate our competition and the needs of our customers and partners to maintain our leadership position and make the portfolio and distribution investments to further penetrate growth areas of the market. 
We expect to focus on the following: 

• | Expand leadership in Managed Document Services by leveraging our strength in large enterprises and broadening our SMB (small to mid-sized business) offerings.


• | Increase SMB coverage through resellers and partners (including multi-brand dealers) and continued distribution acquisitions.


• | Gain share in the A4 product segment of the market, where historically we have been underrepresented, by strengthening our product portfolio and increasing our distribution capacity.


• | Extend leadership in digital color production through continued innovation and growth in new markets.

Geographically, our footprint spans approximately 160 countries and allows us to deliver our technology and solutions to customers of all sizes, regardless of complexity or number of customer locations.
Innovate to Differentiate Our Offerings
We direct our research and development (R&D) investments to areas such as workflow automation, color printing and customized communication, as well as improving the quality and reducing the environmental impact of digital printing. We believe that a critical role of our research is to identify new competency areas for the future. Accordingly, we are investing in new and novel printing technology applications that could offer attractive opportunities in adjacent markets. We expect this will deliver incremental value for our customers and drive profitable revenue growth for our business.
Xerox 2017 Annual Report 2

Accelerate Productivity and Cost Initiatives through Strategic Transformation
We have a proven track record of maintaining strong margins through ongoing cost and productivity initiatives. As markets shift, we undertake restructuring to optimize our workforce and facilities to best align our resources with the growth areas of our business, and to maximize profitability and cash flow in businesses that are declining. In 2016, we initiated a three-year Strategic Transformation program to simplify and create a significantly more effective organization that delivers productivity and cost reduction beyond our historical range of $300 to $350 million of annual savings. The program targets areas such as delivery, remote connectivity, sales productivity, pricing optimization, design efficiency and supply chain optimization. We believe that the program will enable us to reinvest in our business to improve the revenue trajectory and margin expansion. During the first two years, the program delivered over $1.2 billion in gross productivity gains and cost savings and we expect it to provide approximately $475 million of additional cost reductions in 2018. Our goal is to achieve approximately $1.7 billion in savings over the three-year period, outperforming our initial $1.5 billion target. 
Engage, Develop and Support Our People
Our offerings are supported by a global workforce focused on delivering value to our customers. We continue to develop our employees by investing in the processes and systems that enable them to perform their jobs more effectively. We had approximately 35,300 employees worldwide at December 31, 2017.
Post-Sale Driven Business Model and Shareholder-Centered Capital Allocation 
Our business is based on a post-sale, or annuity, model that provides significant recurring revenue and cash generation. In 2017, over 75% of our total revenue was related to post-sale revenue streams including document services, equipment maintenance, consumable supplies and financing, among other elements. The remainder of our revenue was from equipment sales, either from lease agreements that qualify as sales for accounting purposes or outright cash sales.
Our post-sale model supports ongoing strong cash flows, and we have a balanced capital allocation approach with the following objectives:

• | Maintaining an investment grade credit profile,


• | Selectively pursue acquisitions in targeted growth areas, and


• | Return capital to shareholders, targeting to deliver over 50% of free cash flow back to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases over time.

Acquisitions and Divestitures
As part of our strategy, we are focused on increasing our Small and Mid-sized (SMB) coverage through resellers and partners (including multi-brand dealers) and continued distribution acquisitions.
Details about our acquisitions and divestitures in 2017 can be found in Note 4 - Acquisitions and Note 5 - Divestitures, in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Innovation and Research
Xerox has a rich heritage of innovation, which continues to be a core strength of the company as well as a competitive differentiator. Our aim is to create value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees by driving innovation in key areas. Our investments in innovation align with our growth opportunities in areas like workflow automation, color printing, customized communication and new and novel applications of printing technology. 
Our research efforts can be categorized under four themes:
Digital Printing - Improve the cost and capability of digital printing for documents and beyond
Advances in digital printing are enabling mass customization at a run cost approaching the cost of analog printing. We are continuously investing in research to reduce the cost of digital printing consumables while maintaining the high print quality that our customers expect. Our research is also focused on developing new printing technologies that enable us to print digitally on a broader range of media and substrates such as foils, cartons, and directly on end-use products, which will open up new growth markets such as digital packaging. Printing with functional inks will also allow us to add intelligence to packaging, such as sensors, memory, and interactive features, which will enable new analytic-based services, higher security and new consumer experiences. As a responsible corporate citizen, we are also investing in research to lower the environmental impact of our products and consumables.

Personalization at Scale - Enhance value by providing secure, real-time, context-aware personalized products, solutions and services
Whether business correspondence, personal communication, manufactured items or information services, personalization increases the value of communication. Our research leads to technologies that improve the efficiency, economics, relevance and security of our customers' products and services. We help customers improve the impact of their communications by leveraging vast information resources available from private databases or public sources including social media and delivering personalized messages, products and services. Examples of innovation focus areas include creating new capabilities in imaging, multi-media marketing campaign management, workflow automation and augmented reality to deliver personalization at scale.
Agile Enterprise - Create simple, automated and touch-less business workflows resulting in lower cost, higher quality and increased agility
Enterprises of all sizes require agility in order to quickly respond to market changes and new requirements. To enable greater business process agility, our research goals are to simplify, automate and enable business processes on the cloud via flexible platforms that run on robust and scalable infrastructures. We continue to invest in new capabilities to help people better leverage and integrate paper and digital workflows. And we go beyond that to develop innovations for the automation of business workflows. These capabilities leverage our research in image, video and natural language processing, as well as machine learning. Application of these methods to business workflows enables technology automate tasks, thus allowing workers to focus on higher value activities.
Usable Analytics - Transform big data into useful information resulting in better business decisions
Competitive advantage can be achieved by better utilizing available and real-time information. Today, information resides in an ever-increasing universe of servers, repositories and formats. The vast majority of information is unstructured, including text, images, voice and videos. One of our key research areas is making sense of unstructured information using natural language processing and semantic analysis. A second major research area focuses on developing proprietary methods for prescriptive analytics applied to business processes. Here, we seek to better manage very large data systems in order to extract business insights and use those insights to provide our clients with actionable recommendations. Tailoring these methods to various vertical applications leads to new customer value propositions.
Our innovation goals are supported by cross disciplinary research programs in our different research centers. PARC, the most prominent of these centers, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox located in Silicon Valley, California. It provides Xerox commercial and government clients with R&D and open innovation services. PARC scientists have deep technological expertise in areas that we consider fundamental to bring high-impact innovations to our customers and the world; such areas include big data analytics, intelligent sensing, computer vision, networking, printed electronics, energy, and digital design and manufacturing.
Investment in R&D is critical for competitiveness in our fast-paced markets. One of the ways that we maintain our market leadership is through coordination of our R&D with Fuji Xerox (an equity investment in which we maintain a 25% ownership interest).
Our total research, development and engineering expenses (RD&E), which include sustaining engineering expenses for hardware engineering and software development after we launch a product, totaled $446 million in 2017, $476 million in 2016 and $511 million in 2015. Fuji Xerox R&D expenses were $536 million in 2017, $628 million in 2016 and $569 million in 2015.
Segment Information
Following the separation of the BPO business, we realigned our operations to better manage the business and serve our customers and the markets in which we operate. In 2017, we transitioned to a geographic focus and are primarily organized from a sales perspective on the basis of “go-to-market” sales channels. These sales channels are structured to serve a range of customers for our products and services. As a result of this transition and change in structure, we concluded that we have one operating and reportable segment - the design, development and sale of printing technology and related solutions. 
Accordingly, the section below primarily discusses the business based on our primary offerings (Managed Document Services, Workplace Solutions and Graphic Communications) that are brought to the market through these geographic-based sales channels. 
Xerox 2017 Annual Report 4

Revenues
We have a broad and diverse base of customers by both geography and industry, ranging from SMBs to graphic communications companies, governmental entities, educational institutions and Fortune 1000 corporations. Our business does not depend upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business spans three primary offering areas: Managed Document Services (MDS), Workplace Solutions and Graphic Communications. In addition, a smaller portion of our revenues comes from non-core streams including paper sales in our developing market countries, wide-format systems, licensing revenue and Global Imaging Systems network integration solutions. 
Our Managed Document Services includes a continuum of solutions and services that helps our customers optimize their print and communications infrastructure, ensure the highest levels of security & productivity, and enable their digital business objectives. Our primary offerings within Managed Document Services are Managed Print Services (MPS), Multi-Channel Communication Services and a range of Digital Solutions including Workflow Automation Services, Content Management and Digitization Services. MDS excludes legacy printing sourcing contracts that transferred to us upon the spin-off of the BPO business. 
In our MPS business, we help companies assess and optimize their print infrastructure, secure and integrate their environment and automate and simplify their business processes. We provide the most comprehensive portfolio of MPS services in the industry and are recognized as an industry leader by major analyst firms including Gartner, IDC, Quocirca, InfoTrends and Forrester. Our MPS offering targets clients ranging from large, global enterprises to governmental entities and to small and medium-sized businesses, including those served via our channel partners. Our Next Generation Xerox Partner Print Services is a comprehensive suite of services that allows channel partners to support their SMB customers with some of our best-in-class tools, processes, and workflow solutions developed by Xerox for large enterprises.
In our Multi-Channel Communications Services business, we help large enterprise and global clients drive effective communications across a range of digital and physical touch points. We offer a range of platform-enabled digital services that deliver relevant and timely communications focused on customer acquisition, onboarding or retention. Our portfolio includes Collateral Management Services, Demand Generation Services, Product Information Management Services and Centralized Print Production Services.
Our Digital Solutions portfolio features our Workflow Automation solutions, Content Management solutions and Digitization Services. Our Xerox Workflow Automation Services help our customers assess, optimize and automate their workflow in a secure and integrated IT environment. By eliminating ineffective processes, we bring our clients operational excellence in routine workflows as well as industry-specific processes. These offerings are enhanced and complemented by our proprietary content management software solutions including DocuShare 7 and our cloud-based DocuShare Flex platform. In addition, we operate a network of centers that digitize and automate paper & digital workflows enabling our customers to operate cost-efficiently in a fully-digitized environment with speed, quality and 24x7 availability.
Our Workplace Solutions area is made up of two strategic product groups, Entry and Mid-Range, which share common technology, manufacturing and product platforms. Workplace Solutions revenues include the sale of products and supplies, as well as the associated technical service and financing of those products.

• | Entry comprises desktop monochrome and color printers and multifunction printers (MFPs) ranging from small personal devices to workgroup printers and MFPs that serve the needs of office workgroups. Entry products are sold to customers in all segments from SMB to enterprise, principally through a global network of reseller partners and service providers, as well as through our direct sales force.


• | Mid-Range are larger devices that have more features and can handle higher print volumes and larger paper sizes than Entry devices. These products are sold through dedicated partners, our direct sales force, multi-branded channel partners and resellers worldwide. We are a leader in this area of the market and offer a wide range of MFPs, copiers, digital printing presses and light production devices, and solutions that deliver flexibility and advanced features.

Our Graphic Communications Solutions are designed for customers in the graphic communications, in-plant and production print environments with high-volume printing requirements. These solutions enable full-color, on-demand printing of a wide range of applications, including variable data for personalized content and one-to-one marketing. Graphic Communications Solutions revenues include the sale of products, software and supplies, as well as the associated technical service and financing of those products. 

• | Our cut-sheet presses provide graphic communications and commercial printers with high speed, high-volume printing. They are ideal for publishing, transaction printing, print on demand and one-to-one marketing, offering

Xerox 2017 Annual Report 5

the best in high speed, productivity and resolution and color. We are the worldwide leader in the cut-sheet color and monochrome production industry.

• | Our inkjet presses offer a broad range of roll fed, continuous feed printing technologies, including waterless inkjet and aqueous inkjet for vivid color, and toner-based flash fusing for black and white. Our portfolio spans a variety of print speeds, image quality, feeding, finishing and media options. We continue to develop and integrate our production inkjet business to bring the high-end capabilities of toner-based presses such as speed and inline color correction to the more price sensitive market of inkjet. 


• | Our FreeFlow portfolio of software offerings brings intelligent automation and integration to the processing of print jobs, from file preparation to final production, for a touchless workflow. It helps customers of all sizes address a wide range of business opportunities including automation, personalization and even electronic publishing. In 2017, we sold our FreeFlow Print Server (FFPS) DFE business to Electronics for Imaging (EFI). Under the terms of the deal, we established a strategic partnership that will bring to market a next generation digital front end (DFE) solution with more efficiencies, performance and quality to meet the most demanding production requirements. Additionally, EFI will continue to supply and support the current range of FFPS. It should be noted that the sale agreement comprises only the small FFPS business and does not impact our FreeFlow portfolio of software solutions which remains a key plank for our customers’ workflow strategy. 

Geographic Information 
Overall, approximately 40% of our revenue is generated by customers outside the U.S. Additional details can be found in Note 3 - Segment and Geographic Area Reporting.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
In 2017, Xerox and its subsidiaries were awarded 544 U.S. utility patents. Including our research partner Fuji Xerox, we were awarded 1,116 U.S. utility patents during the period. Our patent portfolio evolves as new patents are awarded to us and as older patents expire. As of December 31, 2017, Xerox held approximately 11,470 U.S. design and utility patents. These patents expire at various dates up to 20 years or more from their original filing dates. While we believe that our portfolio of patents and applications has value, in general no single patent is essential to our business. In addition, any of our proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide significant competitive advantages.
In 2017, we were party to numerous patent-licensing agreements and, in a majority of them, we licensed or assigned our patents to others in return for revenue and/or access to their patents or to further our business goals. Most patent licenses expire concurrently with the expiration of the last patent identified in the license. We were also party to a number of cross-licensing agreements with companies that also hold substantial patent portfolios. These agreements vary in subject matter, scope, compensation, significance and duration.
In the U.S., we own about 210 U.S. trademarks, either registered or applied for. These trademarks have a perpetual life, subject to renewal every 10 years. We vigorously enforce and protect our trademarks.
Marketing and Distribution
We go to market with a services-led approach and sell our products and services directly to customers through our worldwide sales force and through independent agents, dealers, value-added resellers, systems integrators and the Web. In addition, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Global Imaging Systems (GIS), an office technology dealer comprised of regional core companies in the U.S., sells document management and network integration systems and services. We continued to broaden our distribution to small and mid-sized businesses in 2017 through expanding our network of resellers and partners (including multi-brand dealers) as well as GIS's acquisition of three equipment and document services dealer companies.
In Europe, Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia, we distribute our products through Xerox Limited, a company established under the laws of England, as well as through related non-U.S. companies. Xerox Limited enters into distribution agreements with unaffiliated third parties to distribute our products in many of the countries located in these regions, and previously entered into agreements with unaffiliated third parties who distribute our products in Sudan. Sudan, among others, has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. Department of State and is subject to U.S. economic sanctions. We maintain an export and sanctions compliance program, and believe that we have been, and are in compliance with, U.S. laws and government regulations for Sudan. We have no assets, liabilities or operations in Sudan other than liabilities under the distribution agreements. After observing required prior notice periods, Xerox Limited terminated its distribution agreements with distributors servicing Sudan in August 2006. Now, Xerox has only legacy obligations to third parties, such as providing spare parts and supplies to these third parties. In 2017, total Xerox revenues of $10.3 billion included approximately $11 thousand attributable to Sudan. 
Xerox 2017 Annual Report 6

Competition
Although we encounter competition in all areas of our business, we are the leader - or among the leaders - in each of our primary offering areas. We compete on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support.
Our larger competitors include Canon, Hewlett-Packard Inc., Konica Minolta and Ricoh. Our brand recognition, reputation for document management expertise, innovative technology and service delivery excellence are our competitive advantages. These advantages, combined with our breadth of product offerings, global distribution channels and customer relationships, position us as a strong competitor going forward.
Customer Financing
We finance a large portion of our direct channel customer purchases of Xerox equipment through bundled lease agreements. We also provide lease financing to end-user customers who purchased Xerox equipment through our indirect channels. We compete with other third-party leasing companies with respect to the lease financing provide to these end-user customers. In both instances, financing facilitates customer acquisition of Xerox technology and enhances our value proposition, while providing Xerox a reasonable return on our investment in this business. Additionally, because we primarily finance our own products and have a long history of providing financing to our customers, we are able to minimize much of the risk normally associated with a finance business.
Because our lease contracts allow customers to pay for equipment over time rather than upfront upon installation, we maintain a certain level of debt to support our investment in these lease contracts. We fund our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand and proceeds from capital market offerings. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $3.7 billion of finance receivables and $0.5 billion of equipment on operating leases, or Total Finance assets of $4.2 billion. We maintain an assumed 7:1 leverage ratio of debt to equity as compared to our Finance assets, which results in approximately $3.7 billion of our $5.5 billion of debt being allocated to our financing business.
Refer to "Debt and Customer Financing Activities" in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of Management's Discussion and Analysis, included in Item 7 of this 2017 Form 10-K, for additional information.
Manufacturing and Supply
Our manufacturing and distribution facilities are located around the world. Our largest manufacturing site is in Webster, N.Y., where we produce the Xerox iGen, Nuvera, Brenva and Direct to Object Inkjet Printer systems, components, EA Toner, consumables, fusers and other products. Our other primary manufacturing operations are located in Dundalk, Ireland, for our High-End production products and consumables; Wilsonville, OR, for solid ink consumable supplies and components; and Aubagne, France, for Impika aqueous ink-jet production systems. We also have a facility in Venray, Netherlands, that manufactures supplies and provides supply chain management for our international operations.
We have arrangements with Fuji Xerox under which we purchase and sell products, some of which are the result of mutual research and development agreements. Refer to Note 10 - Investments in Affiliates, at Equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our relationship with Fuji Xerox.
We maintain a long-standing relationship of over 15 years with FLEX LTD (Flex) (formerly Flextronics), a global electronics manufacturing services company, for our mid-range and entry businesses. Our master supply agreement with Flex renews on an annual basis. 
We also acquire products from various third parties in order to increase the breadth of our product portfolio and meet channel requirements.
Fuji Xerox 
Fuji Xerox is an unconsolidated entity in which we own a 25% interest and FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (Fujifilm) owns a 75% interest. Fuji Xerox develops, manufactures and distributes document processing products in Japan, China, Hong Kong, other areas of the Pacific Rim, Australia and New Zealand. We retain significant rights as a minority shareholder. Our technology licensing agreements with Fuji Xerox ensure that the two companies retain uninterrupted access to each other's portfolio of patents, technology and products. Refer to Note 10 - Investment in Affiliates, at Equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our investment in Fuji Xerox.

International Operations
The financial measures by geographical area for 2017, 2016 and 2015 that are included in Note 3 - Segment and Geographic Area Reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See also the risk factor entitled “Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economic and political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies and shifting regulatory schemes” in Part I, Item 1A included herein.
Backlog
Backlog, or the value of unfilled equipment orders, is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects because a significant proportion of our revenue is fulfilled from existing inventories or within a short period of order signing.
Seasonality
Our revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products, the length of sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases and printing volumes. These factors have historically resulted in lower revenues, operating profits and operating cash flows in the first and third quarter.
