Background
 Auxilio, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on August 29, 1995. 

On April 1, 2004, we acquired Alan Mayo and Associates, Inc. dba The Mayo Group (“TMG”), a managed print company. 
 TMG provided outsourced print management services to healthcare facilities throughout California, which services we provide as the successor-in-interest to TMG. 
 After we acquired TMG, we changed our name to “Auxilio, Inc.” and changed the name of TMG’s former subsidiary to “Auxilio Solutions, Inc.” Effective July 1, 2014, we acquired Delphiis, Inc., a California corporation, which provides IT security consulting services. On April 7, 2015, we acquired certain assets of Redspin, Inc. which provides IT security consulting services. On January 13, 2017, we acquired CynergisTek, Inc., a Texas corporation, which provides IT security consulting services and solutions. Our Common Stock currently trades on the NYSE MKT under the symbol 

“AUXO

.”
 Principal Products and Services
 We are engaged in the business of providing fully-outsourced managed document services, workflow solutions and IT security consulting services primarily to the healthcare industry, and provide services to financial institutions, gaming and other industries when the request arises. Our business is operated throughout the United States. 
 Our document solutions group provides workflow solutions, and is a risk-free program with guaranteed savings. We assume all costs related to print environments through customized streamlined and seamless integration of services at predictable fixed rates. Our on-site staff creates manageable, dependable print management programs by managing the back-office processes of our hospital clients. The process is initiated through a detailed proprietary assessment. The assessment is a strategic, operational and financial analysis that is performed at the customer’s premises using a combination of proprietary processes and innovative technology for data collection and report generation. After the assessment and upon engagement, we charge the customer on a per print basis. This charge covers the entire print management process and includes placement of a highly trained on-site resident team.
 Our IT security consulting group serves the most common security needs: technical risk and penetration testing, process and procedure development and risk management utilizing our proprietary Delphiis™ IT Risk Manager SaaS Solution. Through our proven and prescriptive methodology we help build the foundation needed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and security of patient health information (PHI). And our software application suite streamlines how covered entities perform annual and on-going risk assessments on their business associates, clinics, projects and hospitals.
 Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive market. The majority of the competition in the healthcare industry market for document solution services comes from the large photocopy/multi-functional digital device manufacturers such as Xerox, Canon, Konica Minolta, Ricoh and Sharp. The competitive landscape also contains a number of regional and local equipment dealers and distributors that exist in the communities in which the hospitals serve. In addition, we compete with in-house departments performing the functions that we are seeking them to outsource to us.
 Most of the competition in the healthcare industry market for IT security services comes from large or niche consulting and technology firms such as Accenture, KPMG, Dell Secureworks, and Coal Fire.
 Nevertheless, our analysis of the competitive landscape shows a very strong opportunity for fully-outsourced document solution services and data security services to the healthcare industry, and we believe that we have a strong competitive position in the marketplace due to several important factors:
 

We are primarily focused on the healthcare industry. We are not aware of any other vendor/service provider which has a majority of its business dedicated to solving issues of HIPAA compliance, including printed and stored documents and improving efficiency for the healthcare industry. Our expertise and knowledge base is unmatched in the market. 
 2
 



By focusing solely on the hospital campus, we enjoy much lower turn-around times for service, greater up-sell opportunities and a much deeper service relationship with the customer. 
 

We have technology that is revolutionizing the way in which healthcare providers perform their annual HIPAA analysis, regulatory and on-going risk assessments, by making it fast, effective and affordable for both the assessor and responder. 
 

We believe that we are the only provider offering a unique approach to managed security services. We can deploy a knowledgeable resource allocated 100% to perform a predefined security role on-site or virtually for a defined amount of time, which results in hospital gaining the staff with expertise they need. 
 

We have a unique approach to providing fully-outsourced managed document services program. Our program is completely outsourced and hospitals need only pay a single invoice. We operate the document management process as a department in the hospital with full-time staff on-site. In contrast, other print vendors and dealers in the majority of instances do not provide full-time staff on-site, which results in delays in providing service and supplies to the hospitals. 
 

We are not restricted to any single equipment vendor, which allows us to bring the best printer and copier hardware and software solutions to our customers. Our approach is to use the most appropriate technology to provide a superior solution without any prejudice as to equipment. 
 

We maintain a daily connection with the hospital, which allows us to provide a detailed strategy and plan on printer and copier equipment acquisitions saving the organization a great deal of time, effort and money in this process. 
 Customers
 The majority of our customers are hospitals and their related off-site facilities. 
 The loss of any key customer could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, business, prospects and results of operation. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, our two largest customers represented approximately 49% of our revenues.
 Intellectual Property
 We maintain a database that contains our managed print services customers’ image and document outputs for certain periods of time, for each piece of machinery maintained at the customer’s location and trends for each of the foregoing. 
 Our database allows us to anticipate our customers’ future needs and to meet those needs. In addition, we maintain a database that contains information related to our current security customers and their assigned responders who use our Delphiis™ IT Risk Manager application suite.
 We have not applied for or been granted a patent with respect to any managed print service technology, or processes, as related to document and image management. 
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 282 full-time employees and one part-time employee, including 246 employees engaged in providing services, 
13 employees engaged in sales and marketing, and 
22 employees engaged in general and administrative activities. 
 Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. 
 We believe our employee relations are good.

Stock Purchase Agreement – CynergisTek, Inc.
 
On January 13, 2017, Auxilio, Inc. entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with CynergisTek, Inc., a Texas corporation (“CynergisTek”), Dr. Michael G. Mathews (“Mathews”) and Michael H. McMillan (“McMillan,” and together with Mathews, the “Stockholders”), pursuant to which Auxilio acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Shares”) of CynergisTek from the Stockholders (the “CynergisTek Transaction”). We reported additional details of the CynergisTek Transaction in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 17, 2017 (the “January Current Report”).
 
Pursuant to the SPA, the purchase price paid for the Shares consisted of four components: the Cash Consideration, the Securities Consideration, the Debt Consideration, and the Earn-out Consideration.
 
•

Cash Consideration. We paid the Stockholders a cash payment of $15,000,000, less Closing Net Working Capital Deficit, Funded Indebtedness and Designated Transaction Expenses (defined as certain expenses of the Stockholders and certain expenses of CynergisTek). The net cash amount paid to the Stockholders was $14,202,644.76. 
 
•

Securities Consideration. We issued a total of 1,166,666 shares of Auxilio common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Auxilio Stock”) to the Stockholders, with each of the Stockholders receiving 583,333 shares. 
 
•

Debt Consideration. We issued promissory notes totaling $9,000,000 to the Stockholders (the “Seller Notes”), with each of the Seller Notes having an initial principal amount of $4,500,000. The Seller Notes bear interest at 8% per annum, are quarterly interest-only payments due during the first 12 months, quarterly payments of principal and interest due during the last 24 months, using a 36-month amortization period commencing from that point, with a balloon payment due on the maturity date. Additional details relating to the Debt Consideration is included in the January Current Report. 
 
•

Earn-out Consideration. The Stockholders may be entitled to an additional $7,500,000 based upon the financial performance of CynergisTek after closing of the CynergisTek Transaction, to be calculated based upon EBITDA generated by the CynergisTek business during the earn-out period, which began as of January 1, 2017, and ends on December 31, 2021 (the “Earn-out Payments”). 
 
Pursuant to the SPA, CynergisTek and the Stockholders agreed to deliver to Auxilio certificates representing the Shares; the corporate record books of CynergisTek; and the employment agreements (described below). Auxilio agreed to deliver the Cash Consideration, the Securities Consideration, the Debt Consideration and the signed employment agreements.
 
CynergisTek is a top-ranked cybersecurity and privacy consulting firm focused on healthcare, and offers an array of solutions that help organizations measure privacy and security programs against regulatory requirements and assists in developing a best practice approach to risk management. Since 2004, CynergisTek has served as a partner to hundreds of healthcare providers, payers and vendors with a consulting team comprised of subject matter experts that have a passion for helping clients achieve success. CynergisTek is also dedicated to supporting and educating the industry by contributing to relevant associations such as HIMSS, AHIMA, HFMA, HCCA, AHIA, AHLA, IAPP and CHIME. As disclosed in the January Current Report, Auxilio management believes that the acquisition of CynergisTek will allow Auxilio to improve its ability to help clients and other healthcare industry participants to meet their IT security requirements.  Auxilio management believes that CynergisTek is a strong provider of high quality security and compliance services to the healthcare industry.
 
In connection with the SPA, the Company and the Stockholders also entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) and employment agreements, each of which is discussed in more detail in the January Current Report.

 Reverse Stock Split

On January 12, 2017, the Company announced that it had received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) of the Company's Company Related Action Notification Form (the “Notification Form”) relating to the implementation of a reverse split of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Reverse Stock Split”) at a ratio of one-for-three, that is, one new share for each three old shares of the Company’s common stock.
 On December 22, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment (the “Amendment”) to its Articles of Incorporation relating to the Reverse Stock Split. The Amendment provides that no fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to the holders of record of Common Stock prior to the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, all fractional shares will be rounded up to the next whole number of shares.
 The Reverse Stock Split was approved at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Company’s shareholders. At that meeting, the Company’s shareholders voted to approve a reverse split at a ratio between 1-for-1.5 shares and 1-for-3 shares, to be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Board determined to implement the Reverse Stock Split at the ratio of 1-for-3 shares.
 The Reverse Stock Split became effective with FINRA and in the marketplace at the open of business on Friday, January 13, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), whereupon the shares of common stock began trading on a reverse-split-adjusted basis. 
 All information related to common stock, stock options, warrants and share price for prior periods has been retroactively adjusted in this Annual Report to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split.
 Listing on NYSE MKT
 Since February 14, 2017, our Common Stock has been listed on the NYSE MKT under the symbol “AUXO.” Our common stock had previously traded on the OTCQB market.
