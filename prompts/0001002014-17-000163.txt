ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
 
EcoloCap Solutions Inc. is an integrated and complementary network of environmentally focused technology companies that utilize advanced nanotechnology to design, develop, manufacture and sell cleaner alternative energy products. We bring together the technology, engineering, and operational management for the successful development of environmentally significant products and projects.
 
We plan to develop economically feasible renewable energy.
 
History of the Business
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 18, 2004, as Cygni Systems Corporation. We were originally formed with the intent of raising funds and entering into business as a software design company. From the date of our incorporation until June 17, 2005, we were in the development stage of online and network security management software and online and network security consulting services.
 
A change of control occurred on June 17, 2005. On August 19, 2005, we entered into and closed a Share Exchange Agreement (the "XL Share Exchange Agreement") with XL Generation AG. Pursuant to the terms of the XL Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of XL Generation AG. On August 23, 2005, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Nevada, changing our name to "XL Generation International Inc."
 
XL Generation was the holding company of a Swiss entity, XL Generation AG, which was the marketer of an artificial sport surface called "XL Turf." We aspired to become a leading global force in the artificial turf and flooring markets by building both the strength of the XL brand and strategic partnerships with key regional turf and flooring providers. Due to market and other conditions, our board of directors decided that it was in our best interest to initiate a complete and total withdrawal from the artificial flooring sector, artificial turf and all related business.
 
Following our withdrawal from the artificial flooring sector, artificial turf and all related business and after identifying new business opportunities, we changed our name from "XL Generation International Inc." to "Ecolocap Solutions Inc."
 
On November 13, 2007, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Nevada, changing our name to "EcoloCap Solutions Inc." Our shares of common stock are traded on the Bulletin Board operated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority under the symbol ECOS.
 
On September 10, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of 55% of Micro Bubble Technologies (MBT), a provider of Nano technology, for a purchase price of $7,172,000 in common shares of the Company. This acquisition was funded from common stock.  
 
Micro Bubble developed and manufactures M-Fuel, an innovative suspension fuel that far exceeds all conventional fuels' costs and efficiencies and the NPW machine that converts waste organic oils into biodiesel and pure glycerine.
 
Our Business
 
Ecolocap Solutions Inc. is an integrated and complementary network of environmentally focused technology companies that utilize advanced nanotechnology to design, develop, manufacture and sell cleaner alternative energy products. We bring together the technology, engineering, and operational management for the successful development of environmentally significant products and projects. Our business approach combines science, innovation, and market-ready solutions to achieve environmentally sustainable and economically advantageous, power and energy management practices in the following areas:

M-Fuel
 
EcoloCap Solutions Inc. developed and manufactures M-Fuel, an innovative emulsion fuel that far exceeds all conventional fuels' costs and efficiencies. This environmentally-friendly and economical product is designed to offer fully scalable and customizable fuel solutions that will increase efficiency, lower operating costs, and reduce emissions. M -Fuel is a emulsion of 60% heavy oil, 38%, and a 2% stabilizing additive for external combustion engines and 70% heavy oil, 28% water and 2% stabilizing additive. The production of M-Fuel takes place in our Nano Processing Units (NPU), a self contained device that is sized for output. The NPU's can be configured to operate in conjunction with an engine or burner to sully M-Fuel on demand, or pre-manufactured for delivery.
 

NPW Machine
 
NPW Series biodiesel processing machines will allow customers to utilize cheaper waste feedstock (high free fatty acid organic oils such as trap grease, beef tallow, chicken fat, algae), reduce production cost /gallon, and produce biodiesel exceeding all ASTM specs. Most equipment providers must first approve feedstock to ensure biodiesel quality. We do not need to approve the biodiesel feedstock and there is no limit on the degree of waste oil that can be processed (up to 99.2% FFA Feedstock).
 
ECOS/Bio/ART
 
We are among the first public companies in North America to offer an effective and economical, fully integrated aerobic digestion technology called ECOS/Bio-ART which remediates all organic waste. ECOS/Bio-ART is a superior and less expensive process than the present anaerobic or aerobic digestion methods.
 
Our Current Operations
 
On February 17, 2015, a 1 for 2,000 reverse-stock split was announced on FINRA's daily list and this corporate action took effect at the opening of business on February 18, 2015.
 
On December 19, 2016, we entered into a Supply Agreement (the "Supply Agreement") with Lakeshore Recycling Systems LLC wherein we agreed to manufacture and supply equipment and products to Lakeshore Recycling Systems LLC for resale or lease to their customers.
Our Vision
 
EcoloCap brings together the innovation, engineering, and industry knowledge to create products that have a significant—constructive and quantifiable—impact on the environment, while cost-effectively enhancing intrinsic performance characteristics. With these ground-breaking alternative energy products, EcoloCap is uniquely positioned to unleash the power of nanotechnology and revolutionize the world largest markets. That include: Emulsified HFO (M-Fuel). Bio_Diesel from high fatty acid sources. Old tires to syn-gas, diesel and Charcoal Conversion of low grade coal to syn-gas, methane and charcoal. Low emission conversion of Municipal Waste to steam.

ECOS/Bio-ART is a cost-effective fermenter designed to continuously manage manure problems, farm animal mortality in an environmentally sound way.  ECOS/Bio/ART is cost effective.  We have programs for both small and large scale animal production areas and if offers the following benefits:
 
  
· | Reduces Odor and disease-causing organisms
--+-------------------------------------------


· | Eliminate Lagoons
--+------------------


· | Eliminates ground and water contamination
--+------------------------------------------


· | Hides animal decomposition from public view
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Produces a fertilizer that can be used as a soil enhancement

Competition
 
The M-Fuel technology is unique and is superior to any type of emulsion fuel at reduced selling process than the pre-processed fuel. In our process we recover the free SOx and NOx present in fuel before processing. No other emulsion process eliminates heavy metals, S and N from the fuel prior to processing of the fuel. This process will also be marketed as a standalone process for the elimination of Sulphur from fuel oil.
 
The bio-diesel processing system makes diesel biodiesel from wasted fats. The MBT process is superior to competing process and at 25% of the cost. The MBT process is the only process that produces 99% pure glycerine by product.
 
The markets in which we do business are highly competitive. In the market in which we operate, there are many competitors, some of which are significantly larger, have access to much more important resources or capital than us, or have established reputations among potential customers.
