ITEM 1. Business
Overview
Actua Corporation (f/k/a ICG Group, Inc.) (referred to in this Report as "Actua," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") was formed on March 4, 1996 and is headquartered in Radnor, Pennsylvania.  We are a multi-vertical cloud technology company with offerings that we believe create unique and compelling value for our customers and provide transformative efficiency to vertical markets.  We hold controlling majority equity stakes in three vertical, cloud-based businesses that we believe will generate sustained, meaningful returns for our stockholders through revenue growth and earnings leverage.
Despite the omnipresence of the Internet in the global economy, there remains a surprisingly large number of vertical markets with outdated, offline business processes that could be vastly improved through cloud-based software and services.  Our cloud-based solutions allow us not only to transform old business processes into new automated, streamlined ones but also to create entirely new business processes that would not be possible without the cloud.  In addition, our solutions frequently allow businesses to integrate across their partners, suppliers and customers in ways that were previously impossible, thereby expanding their markets and overall opportunity.

Aside from the transformative efficiency inherent in our solutions, the cloud delivery model that we employ provides significant benefits to our customers.  The model provides customers with richer functionality and allows them to avoid large capital investment and enjoy faster set-up times and continuous upgrades at lower costs.
We feel that the expertise we have developed in connection with our twenty-year active involvement in transforming markets through the adoption of cloud-based software and services allows us not only to identify cloud-based businesses that are positioned to succeed in their respective verticals, but also to accelerate the growth of those businesses through strategic guidance, operational support and financial capital.  To that end, we manage our consolidated vertical cloud-based businesses, BOLT Solutions, Inc. ("Bolt"), FolioDynamics Holdings, Inc. ("FolioDynamix") and VelocityEHS Holdings, Inc. ("VelocityEHS"), which operate in the commercial and personal property and casualty insurance, wealth management and environmental, health and safety ("EH&S") markets, respectively, with a uniform set of industry-standard recurring revenue metrics and specifically look to drive growth at those businesses by:

• | continuously creating compelling, differentiated cloud-based offerings and services through investment in research and development;


• | driving efficient long-term growth in recurring revenue through investment in lead generation, marketing and sales;


• | identifying, structuring and executing accretive acquisitions that accelerate strategic plans, increase revenue growth and, over time, improve margins;


• | investing in and cultivating deep, domain-expert management teams; and


• | implementing strategies to obtain operational leverage and increased profitability while maintaining revenue growth, particularly as a company scales.

We believe that, through those and other measures, we are developing a set of leading businesses that possess unique assets which are hard to replicate and which provide competitive differentiation in the sizable vertical markets in which they operate.  We believe further that our vertical cloud business model focus, which drives the compelling value proposition of our businesses, positions us well to generate sustained, meaningful long-term returns for our stockholders through, among other things:

• | revenue visibility and predictability (and lower revenue volatility than traditional software companies);


• | strong gross margins;


• | disciplined customer acquisition and attractive lifetime customer values, which allow for efficient growth through investment in sales and marketing;


• | economies of scale inherent in multi-tenancy software architecture, which allow a focus on innovation; and


• | ultimately, long-term profitability and positive operating cash flow.

The results of operations of our businesses are reported in two segments:  the "vertical cloud" reporting segment and the "vertical cloud (venture)" reporting segment.  Our vertical cloud reporting segment reflects the aggregate financial results of our businesses:

• | that generally share the economic and other characteristics described above;


• | in which our management takes a very active role in providing strategic direction and operational support; and


• | towards which we devote relatively large proportions of our personnel, financial capital and other resources.

As of the date of this Report, we own substantial majority controlling equity positions in (and therefore consolidate the financial results of) each of the three businesses in our vertical cloud segment: Bolt (of which we own 70%), FolioDynamix (of which we own 98%) and VelocityEHS (of which we own 99%). As described elsewhere in this Report, GovDelivery Holdings Inc. ("GovDelivery"), which was previously in our vertical cloud segment, was sold to an affiliate of Vista Equity Partners ("Vista") on October 18, 2016.
Whenever we complete an acquisition or disposition, we evaluate the impact of the transaction on our reportable segments.  For information regarding the results of operations of our reporting segments, as well as their respective contributions to our consolidated results of operations, see "Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," including Note 17, "Segment Information," to our Consolidated Financial Statements; that information is incorporated herein by reference.
Our Vertical Cloud Businesses
As of the date of this Report, we consolidated the following vertical cloud businesses:
Bolt
Bolt offers a cloud-based platform that, through its unique product and technology connectivity, is changing the way insurance is sold.  The platform provides: 

• | large commercial and personal property and casualty insurance carrier-agencies with a means to enable all of their captive agents to meet the needs of their customers by giving them instant access to a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products from a variety of other prominent carriers;


• | independent commercial and personal property and casualty insurance agents with a means to meet the needs of their customers by giving them instant access to a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products from a variety of prominent carriers;


• | non-traditional sellers of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products with a means to meet the needs of their customers by giving them instant access to a cloud-based distribution network and a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products from a variety of prominent carriers; and


• | commercial and personal property and casualty insurance carriers with a variety of additional distribution channels that foster a richer flow of business across their commercial and personal property and casualty insurance product lines.

Bolt is able to provide its platform-subscriber customers and partners, which include large insurance carrier-agencies, independent insurance agents and other insurance-based organizations, with access to a wide array of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products through its agency appointments from various prominent insurance carriers. Any loss by Bolt of one or more of these agency appointments or one or more of its large platform customers would have a negative impact on Bolt’s business, financial results and condition. Bolt’s platform customers pay both subscription and transaction-based fees (commissions) for use of its platform; the insurance carriers whose products are sold on the platform pay Bolt on a commissions basis for products sold. Bolt sells the periodic (usually multi-year) platform subscriptions to its customers and establishes and manages its carrier agency relationships directly through its internal sales team. In addition to the revenue Bolt derives from providing access to its platform, Bolt also operates as an independent insurance agency and sells commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products directly to consumers online through its platform; those sales represent a relatively small percentage of Bolt’s business.

The insurance intermediary business is highly competitive, and numerous firms, some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources, name recognition and market presence than Bolt, actively compete with Bolt for customers and insurance markets. Competition in the insurance business is largely based on innovation, quality of service and price. A number of insurance companies directly sell insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to third-party agents and brokers. In addition, the cloud has increasingly become a source for the direct placement of personal business lines.  We believe that Bolt’s unique platform and the product and technology connectivity that it offers allows Bolt to compete in the insurance market. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, Bolt spent approximately $3.4 million, $4.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively, on research and development activities.  
As of December 31, 2016, Bolt had 186 employees, all of which are full-time employees.  
FolioDynamix
FolioDynamix offers wealth management service providers and financial advisors a comprehensive, secure, cloud-based wealth management technology platform and advisory solutions for managing the full wealth management lifecycle across all types of investment programs. FolioDynamix provides its customers with leading-edge technology to attract and retain the best advisors, enable more effective business process management, accelerate client acquisition and gain visibility across all assets under management ("AUM").    
FolioDynamix’s customers include a variety of financial services organizations, such as brokerage firms, banks (trust and retail), large registered investment advisors ("RIAs"), and RIA networks and other fee-based managed account providers. FolioDynamix's customers access specified bundles of platform applications through the cloud on a periodic (usually multi-year) subscription basis. FolioDynamix sells the periodic subscriptions directly to its customers through its internal sales team.  FolioDynamix’s comprehensive, integrated platform enables highly sophisticated management of all aspects of a financial services organization’s wealth management process, including:

• | proposal generation and investment policy statement management;


• | client acquisition and onboarding;


• | investment model management;


• | portfolio rebalancing;


• | trading and trade order management;


• | performance management and reporting; and


• | portfolio accounting.

FolioDynamix complements its innovative wealth management platform and applications with institutional-quality research, content and consulting expertise through its subsidiary, FDx Advisors, Inc. ("FDx Advisors").  FDx Advisors is an RIA firm that is independently available to help wealth management firms with due diligence and discretionary investment solutions that can be fully integrated with the FolioDynamix technology platform. The company charges its customers, based on a specified percentage of AUM for these advisory services.
FolioDynamix’s five largest customers in terms of revenue generation represented approximately 54% of its revenue in 2016. Although a loss of one or more of these customers (most of which have been signed to contracts through at least 2017) would have a negative impact on FolioDynamix’s financial results and condition, FolioDynamix does not have any customer the loss of which would have a materially adverse financial impact on our vertical cloud businesses as a whole.
The market for wealth management software and advisory services is fragmented, competitive and rapidly changing. When selling its software to large financial services organizations, FolioDynamix faces competition from software companies who provide end-to-end, cloud-based solutions and an even larger number of software companies that offer individual point solutions; some of these companies may have better name recognition and financial and other resources than FolioDynamix. To a lesser degree, the company competes with in-house solutions that its current and prospective clients may develop. We believe that FolioDynamix’s sophisticated, highly-scalable, comprehensive cloud-based technology platform, along with its deep wealth management domain knowledge and processes, particularly in the areas of research and regulatory compliance, provide it with a strong position in the wealth management software and advisory services market. In October 2016, the company further bolstered its turnkey asset management program ("TAMP") offering through its acquisition of certain assets of SAS Capital Management, LLC ("SAS"). See Note 4 "Consolidated Businesses," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In 2016, 2015 and 2014 FolioDynamix spent approximately $10.5 million, $8.8 million and $0.6 million (which represents the amount of expense recognized in 2014 relating to the period from acquisition date to the end of the year), respectively, on research and development activities.

As of December 31, 2016, FolioDynamix had 156 employees, of which 3 are part-time employees.  
VelocityEHS
VelocityEHS is a platform that features a robust set of cloud-based EH&S tools. These tools allow customers to gain visibility into, and control risk at, their companies in the areas of incident management, audit and inspection training, compliance management, risk analysis, ergonomics, greenhouse gas reporting and sustainability metrics and reporting. 
VelocityEHS’s platform helps businesses create safer work environments by identifying, managing and reducing potential workplace and environmental hazards that save time, lower costs and reduce the risk and liability associated with meeting compliance (particularly U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA")) requirements.  
VelocityEHS’s customers, which include large and mid-market North American businesses in a wide variety of industries (including healthcare, manufacturing, education, construction, hospitality and technology, among many others), access the company’s applications through the cloud on a subscription basis (usually multi-year); VelocityEHS sells the subscriptions directly to its customers through its internal sales team.  
VelocityEHS’s principal offerings are currently chemical management applications. These cloud-based applications provide customers with the ability to track, manage and report on the hazardous chemicals contained in their workplaces, with the HQ RegXR application containing additional regulatory reporting functionality.  Specifically, the applications provide businesses with:

• | 24/7 access to the industry’s leading database of chemical safety data sheets, which ensures that their safety data sheet libraries are complete, up-to-date and OSHA-compliant;


• | user-friendly tools that enable compliance with a variety of hazard communication requirements, such as chemical labeling, safe chemical handling and more (with the HQ RegXR Account application featuring a sophisticated regulatory cross-referencing engine);


• | robust chemical management tools, including chemical mapping features, which significantly increase control over the location, status and risks associated with the chemicals at their facilities;


• | mobile-enabled functionality and chemical inventory scanning technology, which allow on-the-spot access to chemical inventory information via mobile devices; and


• | quick return on investment and low cost of ownership, as they eliminate time-consuming, manual administrative tasks.

VelocityEHS offers a number of customer services to support its HQ Account and HQ RegXR Account applications, such as customer training, safety data sheet authoring and compiling/indexing of customers’ online safety data sheet libraries; those services are sold to customers on a project fee basis.
VelocityEHS has around 12,600 customers, none of which individually account for a material portion of the company’s annual revenues. The market for EH&S software is fragmented and competitive. When selling its applications and services to large organizations, VelocityEHS faces competition from both large horizontal/multi-industry software companies that offer EH&S modules and smaller software companies focused solely on EH&S markets; some of these software companies provide cloud-based software solutions, while others offer only traditional, on-premise software solutions. In the large enterprise EH&S market, VelocityEHS often competes with incumbent vendors, many of which have more name recognition and financial and other resources than VelocityEHS. In the mid-market, VelocityEHS competes sometimes with smaller software companies but more often with home-grown (often manual/off-line) solutions that current and prospective customers may develop. We believe that VelocityEHS’s unparalleled proprietary database, which contains over 11 million safety data sheets, along with its cloud-based, EH&S-focused technology, its sales and marketing expertise and its deep EH&S and regulatory domain knowledge, provides VelocityEHS with a strong competitive position relative to both large and small companies offering competing EH&S software solutions. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, VelocityEHS spent approximately $7.8 million, $5.8 million and $3.6 million, respectively, on research and development initiatives. 
As of December 31, 2016, VelocityEHS had 375 employees, of which six are part-time employees.
