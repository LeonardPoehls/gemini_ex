The Company’s color business excels in a variety of markets including food packaging, industrial packaging and consumer products, and is a trusted source for many of the world’s largest consumer products companies, providing aesthetic solutions for a wide range of bottles, containers, caps and closures including a consistent brand identity.
Masterbatch Solutions
Additionally, the CCS product family provides masterbatches, or concentrates, which are often the key ingredient in a successful application product formula. Masterbatches are combined with polymer resins by the Company’s customers at the point-of-process to provide a unique property portfolio that meets needed performance criteria for a given product application.
For over 50 years, the Company has built a strong global masterbatch business. In recent years, acquisitions have broadened the Company’s product offerings in the high-quality masterbatch markets, provided capacity, flexibility and efficiency to advance the Company’s growth in targeted markets, and reduced dependence on large volume, commodity automotive applications.
The Company's masterbatch product offerings include:

• | Concentrates designed to improve the performance, appearance, and processing of plastics for intended applications;


• | Additive solutions to enhance performance such as antimicrobial, gas barrier, nucleating agents, antifogs, antistatics, release agents, cavitating agents, ultra-violet (“UV”) stabilizers, antioxidants, UV blocking, infrared absorbers, light diffusers, mineral fillers (calcium carbonates, talcs), and flame retardants; and processing (slip agents, antiblocking, process aids, foaming agents, purge compounds); and aesthetic solutions (white, black, synthetic paper, matte, clarifying agents); and


• | Application solutions that have a reduced impact on the environment such as those that minimize the use of plastics or incorporate the use of either recycled plastics or renewable-based polymers.

Film for agricultural, packaging and personal care & hygiene applications continues to be a primary focus for masterbatch products. The Company’s film additives for food packaging are valued for their performance and cost benefits, and are commonly used in biaxially oriented polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate films which are critical for protective packaging of shelf ready foods, snack foods, candy, as well as various consumer products and industrial applications. The Company also provides solutions for agriculture films, offering additives that provide UV control, barrier, and anti-fog solutions among others which increases yields and reduces waste.

Specialty Powders
In its specialty powders product group, the Company has core competencies in size reduction services and powdered material sales whereby polymeric powders are produced for a wide range of technical uses such as rotational molding, oil and gas additives, sports and leisure products, and other demanding processes and markets. Size reduction, or grinding, is a specialized process whereby polymer resins produced by chemical manufacturers, usually but not exclusively in pellet form, are reduced to a specified powder size and form, depending on the customer’s specifications. The majority of the Company’s size reduction services involve ambient grinding, a mechanical attrition milling process suitable for products which do not require ultrafine particle size and are not highly heat sensitive. The Company also provides jet milling services used for friable materials requiring very fine particle size (usually finer than 75 microns) such as additives for plastics, paints and printing ink, adhesives, waxes and cosmetics. For particularly heat-sensitive materials which can be softer and difficult to manage, the Company provides cryogenic milling services, which use liquid nitrogen to chill materials to extremely low temperatures to enable grinding. The Company's cryogenic and jet milling capabilities are very unique in the grinding industry, allowing for a wide range of materials to be processed, and giving the Company a competitive advantage that customers value.
The specialty powders group also produces its own compounded polyolefins designed for the rotational molding markets which include applications such as chemical storage tanks, high-end recreation and sport coolers, performance kayaks, playground slides, and other niche applications requiring large hollow parts.
The product portfolio of specialty powders includes:

• | Compounded colors offered in customized colors and specialty effects;


• | Cross-linkable resins and other performance grades developed specifically for the rotational molding process; and


• | Specialty powders for the oil and gas and other niche industries.

Performance Materials
Performance Materials ("PM") consists of two product groups. During fiscal 2017, the PM product family provided 45% of the Company's consolidated net sales.
Engineered Plastics
The engineered plastics product group provides unique performance characteristics by combining high-performance polymer resins with various modifiers, reinforcements, additives and pigments, which result in a compound tailored to meet stringent customer specifications for durable applications. The Company’s products are often developed to replace metal or other traditional materials. These products typically comprise 100% of the plastics material used by its customers in their end products. The Company began formulating a variety of compounds in the early 1950s, meeting the needs of a newly forming plastics industry and has evolved into a current market leader position.
The Company offers an extensive portfolio based on a variety of polymers allowing customers to tailor solutions that meet their exact performance needs. The Company focuses on the ability to develop enhanced polymer solutions that provide:
•Structural integrity such as strength, stiffness, low distortion, among others;
•Multi-component blends that include polyolefins, nylons, polyesters and elastomers, among others; and

• | Formulating know-how with fiber reinforcements such as glass and carbon, nano-reinforcements, flame retardants, impact modifiers, and UV stabilization.

These products serve numerous markets and applications. Durable consumer products and industrial applications are core markets where continued growth is planned, including such applications as building and construction materials, household appliances, electrical connectors, power tools, recreational items, and lawn and garden equipment. The Company also supplies materials for major, high-end, or specified automotive applications, working closely with major global manufacturers.

Distribution Services
The Company also has a distribution services product group that works with leading global polymer producers to assist in servicing market segments that are not easily accessible to these producers, or does not fit into these producers' core customer segment or supply chain. As a merchant, the Company buys, repackages into A. Schulman labeled packaging, and resells producer grade polymers to our customers, providing sales, marketing and technical services where required. The Company leverages its global supply relationships to fill customer needs within USCAN and EMEA for a variety of olefins and non-olefin resins, as well as selected styrenics and engineering plastics. This consumption of large quantities of base resins also helps support the customers of our other product families by providing purchasing leverage to help keep costs down and providing reliable, convenient access to bulk resin supplies to customers.
The Company’s distribution offerings include specialty polymers for all processing types, including injection molding, blow molding, thermoforming and film and sheet extruding. Providing various compliant grades, the Company has products that meet the most stringent of needs while allowing customers to optimize their cost-to-performance ratio. Most grades can be supplied in carton, bulk truck and rail car quantities, thus helping customers manage inventory levels and their working capital. The Company’s products are supplied into every major plastics market segment such as packaging, mobility, building and construction, electronics and electrical, and agriculture, among others.

Dependence on Customers
During the year ended August 31, 2017, the Company’s five largest customers accounted in the aggregate for less than 10% of net sales.
Availability of Raw Materials
The raw materials required by the Company are available from a number of major plastic resin producers or other suppliers. The Company does not distinguish between raw materials and finished goods because numerous products that can be sold as finished goods are also used as raw materials in the production of other inventory items. The principal materials used in the manufacture of the Company’s proprietary plastic compounds are polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, nylon and titanium dioxide. For additional information on the availability of raw materials, see ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS, Shortages or changes in the price of raw materials and energy costs could adversely affect operating results and financial condition, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Working Capital Practices
The nature of the Company’s business does not require significant amounts of inventories to be held to meet rapid delivery requirements of its products or services or ensure the Company of a continuous allotment of materials from suppliers. The Company’s manufacturing processes are generally performed with a short response time. The Company generally offers payment terms to its customers that factor in credit risk and industry practices. For additional information relating to the Company’s working capital items, see ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition
The Company’s business is highly competitive. The Company competes with producers of basic plastic resins, many of which also operate compounding plants, as well as other independent plastic compounders and molders. The producers of basic plastic resins generally are large producers of petroleum and chemicals, which are much larger than the Company. Some of these producers compete with the Company principally in such competitors’ own respective local market areas, while other producers compete with the Company on a global basis.
Management believes the Company also competes with other merchants and distributors of plastic resins and other products. Limited information is available to the Company as to the extent of its competitors’ sales and earnings in respect of these activities, but management believes that the Company has a fraction of the highly-fragmented distribution market. In addition, the Engineered Composites business mainly competes with other merchants participating in the compounding step of the composites value chain.
Management believes the principal methods of competition in plastics manufacturing are innovation and development of proprietary formulations, application and processing know-how, price, availability of inventory, quality, quick delivery and service. The principal methods of competition for merchant and distribution activities are price, availability of inventory and service. Management believes it has strong financial capabilities, excellent supplier relationships and the ability to provide quality plastic compounds at competitive prices. In addition, A. Schulman has a balanced global footprint which allows the Company to effectively serve multi-national customers globally while maintaining a solid local presence to quickly address changing markets, shorten delivery cycles and meet local customer demands.
