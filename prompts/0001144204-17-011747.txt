In addition, we had Adjusted EBITDA of $201.7 million and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016. (Item 7 of this Annual Report and Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements include a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure).
 ﻿
 We believe that our engineering, manufacturing, and program management capabilities, our competitive cost and quality, our financial discipline, and our colleague engagement position us for long-term success.
 ﻿
 Our History and Corporate Structure 
 Our Corporate History
 On October 15, 2010, our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange following our initial public offering (“IPO”). On July 31, 2013, Tower International Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of Cerberus, completed the sale of 7,888,122 shares of our common stock in a secondary public offering.  Upon completion of the sale, Cerberus no longer controlled a majority of our outstanding common stock and therefore, we ceased being a “controlled company” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards. On November 6, 2013, Tower International Holdings, LLC, completed the sale of 3,000,000 shares of our common stock in another secondary public offering. In addition, Tower International Holdings, LLC completed multiple transactions during the fourth quarter of 2013 whereby it sold additional shares of our common stock in the open market. As a result of these sales, Tower International Holdings, LLC and Cerberus held no shares of our common stock at December 31, 2014.
 ﻿
 Sale of China Joint Ventures
 On December 6, 2015, the Company completed the sale of our equity interest in our Xiangtan DIT Automotive Products Co. Ltd. (“Xiangtan”) joint venture. The sale agreement provided for the repayment of $9.9 million of the Company’s shareholder loans to the joint venture, and the purchase of the Company’s equity in the joint venture for $3.5 million, net of tax.
 ﻿
 On December 31, 2015, the Company completed the sale of our equity interest in our Changchun Tower Golden Ring Automotive Products Co., Ltd. (“TGR”) joint venture. The sale agreement provided for the purchase of the Company’s equity in the joint venture for $29.4 million, and the payment of a dividend of $14.8 million, net of tax.
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2015, all proceeds from both transactions were received.    ﻿
 In October of 2016, the Company entered into agreements in principle to sell its two remaining joint ventures in China:  Tower Automotive Company, Ltd. (“Wuhu”) and Tower DIT Automotive Products Co., Ltd. (“Ningbo”). The sale agreements provided for purchase of the Company’s equity in the joint ventures for approximately $25 million, net of tax. Both agreements are subject to Chinese government approval.  During 2016 the Company received proceeds of $4.5 million from these sales, the remainder is expected to be received during 2017.  No material gain or loss on sale is expected to be recorded except for the impairment loss of $3.1 million recorded in the period ended June 30, 2016 related to Ningbo.
 ﻿
 All of our China joint ventures have been presented as discontinued operations, and are considered held for sale in accordance with FASB ASC No. 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with FASB ASC No. 205, Discontinued Operations.

 Sale of Brazil Facility
 On December 21, 2015, the Company sold one of its two operations in Brazil. Net cash proceeds from this sale were $9.5 million.   During the second quarter of 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to sell the Company’s remaining business operations in Brazil. At December 31, 2016, the remaining Brazilian business operations are considered held for sale in accordance with FASB ASC No. 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with FASB ASC No. 205, Discontinued Operations.
 ﻿
 Our Industry
 We believe OEMs produce a majority of their structural metal components and assemblies internally. While OEM policies differ and may be especially impacted by their own capacity utilization, the capital expenditures associated with internal production can be substantial. Because of this capital and fixed cost-intensity, we believe that longer term, OEMs will outsource a greater proportion of their stamping requirements and we may benefit from this shift in our customer’s preferences. In addition, we believe OEMs will increasingly favor larger, more capable, financially strong regional suppliers. Given our manufacturing, engineering, and operational program management capabilities, we believe we are particularly well-positioned in North America and Europe to take advantage of these potential opportunities.
 ﻿
 Our Strategy
 We seek to:
 ﻿

· | Execute a business model that generates sustainable ongoing free cash flow, providing flexibility for capital allocation and resilience during cyclical downturns;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Achieve organic growth above industry levels through strong competitive capabilities in engineering, manufacturing, and program management that contribute to leading positions in cost and quality;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Opportunistically pursue accretive acquisitions;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Achieve and maintain appropriate net debt leverage of about 1 times Adjusted EBITDA, which we consider to be integral to a financially strong and capable automotive parts supplier;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Return capital to shareholders through regular dividends, stock repurchases and, when appropriate, other actions; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Manage risk through financial discipline.
--+------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Execute Business Model Focused on Free Cash Flow
 Free cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash disbursed for purchases of property, plant and equipment) is one of our most important financial metrics. Our focus on sustainable ongoing free cash flow keeps us disciplined regarding product pricing and margins, as well as determining and prioritizing affordable capital expenditures. To further our alignment with our business model, free cash flow is a major component of our annual bonus program for salaried and hourly colleagues. (Item 7 of this Annual Report includes a discussion of free cash flow as a non-GAAP measure).
 ﻿
 Achieve Organic Growth Above Industry and Opportunistically Pursue Accretive Acquisitions
 We have demonstrated the ability to win significant net new business from our customers from a combination of share gains from competitors via conquest wins and OEM outsourcing. In addition, the increased use of aluminum, higher strength steels and hot forming (i.e., “light weighting”) with complex joining technologies is providing us with higher value-add opportunities. We believe our ability to win new business at a return in excess of our cost of capital is a direct reflection of our core engineering strength, competitive cost and quality, and proven ability to manage complex new-model launches for OEM customers.  We use processes such as Lean Six Sigma, labor best practices standardization, and advanced product quality planning (APQP) to drive productivity and quality while managing new programs on time and on budget.    ﻿
 We believe Tower is positioned for organic growth well above industry from 2017 through at least 2019 as a result of major new business awards primarily in North America that are anticipated to provide about $290 million of annual ongoing revenue.  We also believe there can be future upside growth opportunities from accretive acquisitions. Our projections regarding future performance constitute forward-looking statements. For information regarding the risks associated with forward looking statements, see “—Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” 
 ﻿
 Achieve and Maintain Appropriate Leverage
 Achieving and maintaining net debt leverage (defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by annual Adjusted EBITDA) at our target of 1 times Adjusted EBITDA is an important business priority for optimizing cost of capital and maintaining appropriate financial strength. As of December 31, 2016, our net debt was $327.5 million, representing net debt leverage of 1.6 times.  (Item 7 of this Annual Report includes a discussion of net debt as a non-GAAP measure).

 Return Capital to Shareholders
 With our long-term leverage target in sight, we have begun returning capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Tower raised its regular quarterly dividend per common share by 10%.  In addition, on June 17, 2016, the Company announced its Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase up to $100 million of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock from time to time in the open market, or in privately negotiated transactions (the “Repurchase Program”). As of December 31, 2016, 829,648 shares have been purchased for $18.9 million under the Repurchase Program.
 ﻿
 Manage Risk
 We consider risk management to be an important part of our ability to operate predictably and successfully in the cyclical automotive parts industry. Foremost in managing risk is financial discipline, beginning during the evaluation and approval of new programs to ensure sound assumptions and projected returns in excess of our cost of capital. During each year, we carefully monitor and manage all elements of cost, with an objective of achieving productivity and other savings that offset customer price reductions and labor and overhead inflation. Through our commercial agreements, we are largely shielded from changes in steel prices.
 ﻿
 Customer and Vehicle Portfolio
 We believe we have a well diversified customer mix, as seven different OEMs individually accounted for 5% or more of our revenues in 2016. The following table summarizes our customer mix as a percent of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.    ﻿

 Our Products
 We produce a broad range of structural components and assemblies, many of which are critical to the structural integrity of a vehicle. Images of some of the products we offer are presented below.
Offerings 
----------------------
﻿ Product Offerings – 

  Body structures and assemblies 
 Body structures and assemblies form the basic upper body structure of the vehicle and include structural metal components such as body pillars, roof rails, and side sills. This category also includes Class A surfaces and assemblies, which are components of the “exterior skin” of the vehicle—body sides, hoods, doors, fenders, and pickup truck boxes. These components form the appearance of the vehicle, requiring flawless surface finishes. 
 ﻿

 ﻿
 Chassis and lower vehicle structures 
 Lower vehicle frames and structures include chassis structures that make up the “skeleton” of a vehicle and which are critical to overall performance, particularly in the areas of noise, vibration and harshness, handling, and crash management. These products include pickup truck and SUV full frames, automotive engine and rear suspension cradles, floor pan components, and cross members that form the basic lower body structure of the vehicle. These heavy gauge metal stampings carry the load of the vehicle, provide crash integrity, and are critical to the strength and safety of vehicles.
 ﻿
 Complex body-in-white assemblies 
 Complex body-in-white assemblies are comprised of multiple components and sub-assemblies welded to form major portions of the vehicle’s body structure. We refer to body-in-white as the manufacturing stage in which the vehicle body sheet metal has been assembled but before the components and trim have been added. Examples of complex assemblies include front and rear floor pan assemblies and door/ pillar assemblies.

 International Operations 
 We have significant manufacturing operations outside the United States. In 2016, 35% of our revenues originated outside the United States. For information regarding potential risks associated with our international operations, see Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry and Our Business — “Our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries”. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our international operations.

Manufacturing and Operations 
 Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of stamping and welding operations, system and modular assembly operations, cold and hot forming, coating, and other ancillary operations. Stamping involves passing metal through dies in a stamping press to form the metal into three-dimensional parts. We produce stamped parts using precision single-stage, progressive, and transfer presses, ranging in size from 100 to 4,500 tons, which perform multiple functions to convert raw material into finished products. We invest in our press technology to increase flexibility, improve safety, and minimize die changeover time.
 ﻿
 We feed stampings into assembly operations that produce complex assemblies through the combination of multiple parts that are welded or fastened together. Our assembly operations are performed on either dedicated, high-volume welding/fastening machines or on flexible, cell-oriented robotic lines. The assembly machines attach additional parts, fixtures, or stampings to the original metal stampings. In addition to standard production capabilities, our assembly machines are also able to perform various statistical control functions and identify improper welds and attachments. 
 ﻿
 Our products use various grades and thicknesses of steel and aluminum, including high–strength, hot- and cold-rolled, galvanized, organically coated, stainless, and aluminized steel. Although changing steel prices affect our results, we seek to be neutral with respect to steel pricing over time, with the intention of neither making nor losing money as steel prices fluctuate. The pricing of our products includes a component for steel which can increase as steel prices increase and decrease as steel prices decrease. For our North American customers and several of our other customers, we purchase steel through our customers’ resale programs, where our customers actually negotiate the cost of steel for us. In other cases, we procure steel directly from the mills, negotiating our own price and seeking to pass through steel price increases and decreases to our customers.
 ﻿
 We focus on achieving superior product quality at the lowest operating costs possible and concentrate on improving our manufacturing processes to drive out inefficiencies. We seek to continually improve our processes through efforts to improve our cost competitiveness and achieve higher quality.
 ﻿
 We are committed to sustaining Lean Six Sigma principles throughout our manufacturing processes and as of December 31, 2016, we employed 106 certified black belts. We utilize Lean Six Sigma principles to increase the efficiency of our operations and to reduce operating costs, thereby improving our cost competitiveness. We have accomplished efficiency improvements, while at the same time improving our quality.
 ﻿
 Supply Base—Manufactured Components and Raw Materials 
 We purchase various manufactured components and raw materials for use in our manufacturing processes. All of these components and raw materials are available from numerous sources. We employ just-in-time manufacturing and sourcing systems, enabling us to meet customer requirements for faster deliveries, while minimizing our need to carry significant inventory levels. The primary raw material used to produce the majority of our products is steel. A portion of our steel is purchased from certain of our customers through various OEM resale programs. The remainder of our steel purchasing requirements is met through contracts with steel producers and market purchases. In addition, we procure small- and medium-sized stampings, fasteners, tubing, and rubber products. 
 ﻿
 Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 
 Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to create awareness of our engineering, program management, manufacturing and assembly expertise, and to translate our leadership position into contract wins. We have developed a sales team that consists of an integrated group of professionals, including skilled engineers and program managers, whom we believe provide the appropriate mix of operational and technical expertise needed to interface successfully with OEMs. We sell directly to OEMs through our sales and engineering teams at our technical centers, which are strategically located around the world. Bidding on automotive OEM platforms typically encompasses many months of engineering and business development activity. We integrate our sales force directly into our operating team and work closely with our customers throughout the process of developing and manufacturing a product. Our proximity to our customer base enables us to enjoy close relationships with our customers and positions us well to seek future business awards. 
 ﻿
 Customers 
 We have developed long-standing business relationships with our automotive customers around the world. We work together with our customers in various stages of production, including development, component sourcing, quality assurance, manufacturing, and delivery. With a diverse mix of products and facilities in major markets worldwide, we believe we are well-positioned to meet customer needs. We believe we have a strong, established reputation with customers for providing high-quality products at competitive prices, as well as for timely delivery and customer service. Given that the automotive OEM business involves long-term production contracts awarded on a platform-by-platform basis, we believe that we can leverage our strong customer relationships to obtain new platform awards.  Contracts are typically sole-sourced to one supplier for individual platforms.

 ﻿
 Customer Support 
 We have six engineering and sales locations throughout the world, including a 24-hour engineering support center in India. We believe that we provide effective customer solutions, products, and service to our customers. Our customer service group is organized into customer-dedicated teams within regions to provide more focused service to our clients. 
 ﻿
 Seasonality   
 Our customers in North America and Europe typically shut down vehicle production during portions of July - August and for one week in late December. Our quarterly results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity may be impacted by these seasonal practices. For example, working capital is typically a use of cash during the first quarter of the year and a source of cash generation in the fourth quarter. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on working capital.
 ﻿
 Competition 
 We principally compete for new business at the beginning of the development of new models and on the redesign of existing models. New-model development generally begins two to three years before the marketing of such models to the public. Once a supplier has been designated to supply parts for a new program, an OEM will usually continue to purchase those parts from the designated producer for the life of the program, although not necessarily for a major redesign. OEMs typically evaluate suppliers based on many criteria such as quality, price/cost competitiveness, system and product performance, reliability and timeliness of delivery, new product and technology development capability, excellence and flexibility in operations, location relative to the customer’s assembly plant, effectiveness of customer service, and overall management capability. 
 ﻿
 We believe that we compete effectively with other leading suppliers in our sector. Our main tier one competitors include: Magna International, Inc. (Cosma division), Gestamp Automocion, Martinrea International, Metalsa, S.A. de C.V., Gruppo Magnetto, and Benteler Automotive. We compete with other competitors with respect to certain of our products and in particular geographic markets. The number of our competitors has decreased in recent years and we believe that number will continue to decline due to supplier consolidation. In addition, most of our OEM customers manufacture similar products that compete with our products. We believe the recent trend has been for OEMs, on average, to increase outsourcing, and we expect that trend to continue, which may provide above-industry growth opportunities for key suppliers like Tower.
 ﻿
 Joint Ventures 
 In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into agreements in principle to sell its two remaining joint ventures in China: Wuhu and Ningbo.
 ﻿
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 7,900 employees worldwide, of whom approximately 5,200 were covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire at various times.  We are not aware of any significant work stoppages since the formation of Tower Automotive Inc., our predecessor (the “Predecessor Company”), in 1993. A prolonged strike or slow-down by one of our unions could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. 
 ﻿
 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to various domestic and foreign Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and health and safety, including those regulating the following: soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal, and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of materials, including greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. We have taken steps to comply with the numerous and sometimes complex laws, regulations, and permits. We have also achieved ISO 14001 registration for substantially all of our facilities, which means we have implemented environmental management systems to improve our environmental performance. Compliance with environmental requirements has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position and we have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures pursuant to such requirements. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to fines, penalties, enforcement actions, or lawsuits.

 ﻿
 Environmental laws, regulations, and permits, and the enforcement thereof, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. In particular, more rigorous GHG emission requirements are in various stages of development. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“U.S. EPA”) has promulgated the GHG Reporting Rule, which requires reporting of GHG data and other relevant information from large sources and suppliers in the United States and the GHG Tailoring Rule, which requires certain facilities with significant GHG emissions to obtain emissions permits under the authority of the Clean Air Act (typically limited to only the largest stationary sources of GHGs.) The United States Congress has also considered imposing additional restrictions on GHG emissions. Any additional regulation of GHG emissions by either the United States Congress and/ or the U.S. EPA could include a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement, or other program, and could subject us to significant costs, including those relating to emission credits, pollution control equipment, monitoring, and reporting, as well as increased energy and raw material prices. In addition, our OEM customers may seek price reductions from us to account for their increased costs resulting from GHG regulations. Further, growing pressure to reduce GHG emissions from mobile sources could reduce automobile sales, thereby reducing demand for our products, and ultimately our revenues. At this time, none of our facilities are required to report GHG emissions or participate in any cap-and-trade system programs under the existing regulatory scheme. However, there is still significant uncertainty surrounding the scope, timing, and effect of future GHG regulation, and any changes to the current laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, product demand, and liquidity.    ﻿
 We are also responsible for certain costs relating to contamination at our, or the Predecessor Company’s, current or formerly owned or operated properties or third party waste disposal sites, even if we are not at fault. Certain locations have been impacted by environmental releases and soil or groundwater contamination is being addressed at certain of these sites. In addition to potentially significant investigation and remediation costs, contamination can give rise to third party claims, including fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury, or property damage. Our costs and liabilities associated with environmental contamination could be substantial and may be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Refer to Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our environmental liabilities.
