Company History and Recent Developments
 
Image Chain Group Limited, Inc.
 
Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. (formerly Have Gun Will Travel Entertainment, Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013, and initially sought to create reality television programming. References in this Report to “ICGL”, “Image Chain”, the “Company”, the “Registrant”, “we”, “our” or “us” are to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc.
 
On May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the “FDHG Exchange Agreement”) with Fortune Delight Holdings Group Ltd (“FDHG”) and Wu Jun Rui, on behalf of himself and certain other individuals who were to receive shares of ICGL pursuant to the FDHG Exchange Agreement (the “FDGH Shareholders”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the FDHG Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000 shares of FDHG common stock, consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG, to ICGL in exchange for the issuance to the stockholders of FDHG of 59,620,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $.001 per share (“Common Stock”) and 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s preferred stock, par value $.001 per share (“Preferred Stock”).
 
As a result of the closing of the FDHG Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. FDHG, through its subsidiaries, manufactured and sold “Image Tea”-branded tea products from its tea garden in Yunnan Province.
 
On June 11, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation in order to change its name to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. and to increase the authorized shares of Common Stock from 70,000,000 to 400,000,000. The name change was undertaken in order to more closely align with the operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, The increase in authorized Common Stock was undertaken to allow the Company to utilize the newly available shares to raise capital.
 
On or about November 15, 2016, FDHG disposed of its ownership of all operating assets, and as a result ICGL became a shell company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (the “Disposition Event”). The Disposition Event is evidenced by a bought and sold note stamped by the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, which we believe is a legally binding document.
 
On February 13, 2017, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada a Certificate of Correction (the “Certificate of Correction”) to correct a mistake made in the Company’s original Articles of Incorporation with regard to the Preferred Stock issued in connection with the FDHG Exchange Agreement. As a result, ICGL had 395,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. The Company subsequently entered into an agreement pursuant to which the holder of the Preferred Stock agreed to retire the Preferred Stock in exchange for receiving an equal number of shares of Common Stock of the Company. As of the date of this Report, that exchange of Preferred Stock for Common Stock has not yet occurred.
 
On May 1, 2017, upon recommendation of the Board of Directors, a majority of Image Chain’s common stockholders consented in writing to amendment of Image Chain’s Articles of Incorporation to (i) effect a reverse stock split on a 1 for 100 stock split basis from 400,000,000 authorized shares with a par value of $0.001 per share to 4,000,000 authorized shares with a par value of $0.001, and (ii) after the reverse stock split, to increase the authorized shares of Common Stock from 3,950,000 to 2,000,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.001 per share, and to decrease the authorized shares of Preferred Stock from 50,000 to zero (0). As of the date of this Report, the reverse stock split and increase in authorized shares have been completed, and the decrease in shares of Preferred Stock is still in process, as a result 50,000 shares of Preferred Stock are authorized and outstanding.

The Share Exchange
 
On November 14, 2017, Image Chain entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Image P2P and the shareholders of Image P2P (the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Sellers transferred all 50,000 shares of Image P2P outstanding common stock to the Company in exchange for 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Image P2P became the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary. Image P2P, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in producing, marketing and selling tea polyphenol products, and is developing for production tea polyphenol-based products. Image P2P is located in the PRC.
 
The Share Exchange has been accounted for as a reverse- merger and recapitalization of Image Chain where Image Chain (the legal acquirer) is considered the accounting acquiree and Image P2P (the acquiree) is considered the accounting acquirer. As a result of this transaction, the Company is deemed to be a continuation of the business of Image P2P.

Company Overview
 
We extract tea polyphenol from tea leaves for use in a wide variety of health and beauty products, beverages, filters and purifiers, and other products. We produce tea polyphenol to the specific requirements of end-users, utilizing different types of tea leaves harvested at different points in the growth cycle. We are also developing proprietary tea polyphenol-based products for sale. Our newly-installed tea polyphenol extraction assembly completed ramp up in 2017. Given sufficient access to raw materials and working capital, we expect the annual manufacturing capacity of our currently installed extraction assembly to reach 600 metric tons of tea polyphenol. We operate our business from our newly constructed facilities in Wan’An City, Jiangxi Province, PRC. Our facilities consist of our first extraction assembly, polyphenol drying and processing clean room, warehouse, showroom, research facility and offices.
 
Since its founding in 2013, Fuzhiyuan Biotechnology focused on acquiring the technical processes, land, equipment and capital for the construction of the largest tea polyphenol extraction and processing facility in the PRC. In 2013 and 2014 we developed working relationships with experts in the field of tea polyphenols and extraction processes, located a suitable site for our facility, negotiated with and applied to relevant government authorities for approval of our project, applied to lenders for financing the acquisition of our land use rights and equipment, applied for construction loans, and negotiated with equipment suppliers and construction firms. Construction of our facility began in 2015 and was substantially completed by the third quarter of 2016, with initial commercial production and sales achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016. The ramp-up of our facility concluded in 2017.

Product and Market Overview
 
Tea polyphenol-based products have become popular in health-conscious communities throughout the world. Polyphenols are antioxidants found at varying levels in most fruits and vegetables. Tea leaves contain relatively high levels of polyphenols. Research has found intake of tea polyphenols through drinking tea to correlate to lower levels of certain types of cancer, stroke, heart disease and Alzheimer’s disease. There is also clinical interest in the correlation, if any, to intake of tea polyphenols and weight loss, and the control of the symptoms of type II diabetes. Although we supply tea polyphenols for use in tea polyphenol-based products, we do not make any claims, either through our own sales and marketing, through our third- party distributors, or otherwise, as to the medical benefits of our tea polyphenol products. We do not believe that we are engaged in the production of pharmaceutical products, or that the markets in which our tea polyphenol are used regulate tea polyphenol-based products as pharmaceuticals.
 
Interest in the health benefits of tea polyphenols have led to their incorporation in a range of products – shampoos, soaps, facial wipes, creams and cosmetics; concentrated beverages, health beverages, sports beverages and caffeinated beverages; candies, cooking oils, and syrups; air purifiers, air conditioner air filters, face masks and cleaning wipes. For example, in Japan, tea polyphenol -based air conditioner air filters, shampoos, soaps and facial wipes are seen as providing superior anti-viral and anti-biotic cleaning properties. In Germany, tea polyphenol-based beverages have gained acceptance for purported digestive and restorative properties.
 
It is difficult to estimate the global market for tea polyphenol-based products or tea polyphenols. According to our understanding of the market and consultation with PRC research institutes, PRC production of tea polyphenols reached 5,000 metric tons in 2015, and are estimated to be growing at over 30% per annum. The main markets for tea polyphenols are East Asia and Europe. Based on our understanding of tea leaf and tea polyphenol domestic and foreign markets, participation in trade fairs, sales and marketing efforts, research into tea polyphenol-based products and consultation with relevant academic institutions in the PRC, we believe that in the near-term the market for tea polyphenol will be characterized by increased demand at steady price levels.
 
Our Strengths
 
We believe our competitive advantages currently include:
 

● | our understanding of tea leaf and tea polyphenol properties attained through cooperation with leading academics and our own internal team of tea polyphenol production experts; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | technical expertise in producing tea polyphenols to precise chemical specifications, which we believe will distinguish us from competitors as tea polyphenols are incorporated in a wider range of tea polyphenol-based products; 
● | low input costs as we continue to improve our extraction process know-how, thus improving production efficiency; 
● | location in a key tea leaf growing region in China, with access to tea leaf supply from throughout the PRC; and 
● | scalability of our business – our current facility can host further extraction assemblies in addition to the extraction assembly currently in operation. 

Our Strategy
 
We expect to grow and increase the profitability of our business through:
 

● | further lowering our input costs with process improvements in tea polyphenol extraction, drying and processing; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | growing our revenues with increased sales and marketing activities; 
● | expanding our sales channels by obtaining export licenses for tea polyphenol and tea polyphenol-based products; 
● | launching our proprietary tea polyphenol-based products in 2018; and 
● | increasing our production capacity through installation of further tea polyphenol extraction assemblies.

As of the date of this Report, we have not entered into any agreements for the financing, development or construction of further tea polyphenol extraction assemblies.
 
Extraction and Powder Process
 
The extraction of tea polyphenol from tea leaves begins with the purchase of tea leaves. Tea leaves at different stages of the growth cycle have different chemical properties, and so we maintain supplies of tea leaves harvested at different times in the grow season. We prepare tea leaves for polyphenol extraction based on the chemical specifications of an order. Tea leaves are stored dry and no chemical additives are introduced prior to the extraction process.
 
An advanced emulsion and distillation process is used to extract tea polyphenols. After being steeped in water at a controlled temperature, gravity, water pressure, heat and centrifuge separation are used to prepare an intermediate liquid for distillation. Chemical catalysts are introduced to bring the tea polyphenols into the intermediate liquid and to stabilize the liquid for distillation. The intermediate liquid is distilled through four different phases, with measuring of chemical composition of the liquid at each phase. The distilled liquid is moved through a closed system to our powder process clean room. There, pressure and heat remove water, leaving powdered tea polyphenol product. We package our tea polyphenol in our clean room, and store the packaged product in temperature- and humidity-controlled storerooms onsite.
 
Suppliers
 
We purchase tea leaves from a number of suppliers in the PRC. We typically pay deposits for the delivery of orders to an intermediate warehouse managed by the supplier or an agricultural cooperative associated with the supplier. Tea leaves are delivered to our facility by the distributor at our request and upon payment in full of the purchase price.
 
Due to recent changes in the European Union quality standards for the import of tea leaves, a greater portion PRC domestic tea leaf production is being exported, resulting in higher domestic market prices for tea leaves. We believe this development has been fully reflected in the PRC tea leaf market in 2016, and do not expect this development to have any further effect on our ability to obtain tea leaf supply, or the price we pay for tea leaves.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Third-party distributors sell our tea polyphenol to end-users, primarily in markets outside the PRC. We have applied for an export license for tea polyphenol and tea polyphenol-based products, and plan to export our products directly to end-users once the relevant licenses are obtained.
 
As a growth business, most of our office and research staff participate to some extent in our marketing efforts. We do not operate a separate sales and marketing department. We engage in marketing of our tea polyphenol and tea polyphenol - based products with both PRC and foreign distributors of tea polyphenol. Our staff promotes our tea polyphenol products at our showroom in Jiangxi Province and at trade fairs. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on business development through client functions, participation in trade fairs, distribution of marketing materials to potential customers and the media and active participation in academic and trade groups. We plan to grow our sales and marketing function through the establishment of a separate sales and marketing department, increased participation in domestic trade fairs and other sales events, participation in foreign marketing events and online and other media promotion of tea polyphenol and tea polyphenol-based products.
 
Competition
 
We compete primarily with other tea polyphenol manufacturers in the PRC and India. The barriers to entry for our industry are significant, given the cost of the equipment and clean room, space required to house the manufacturing facilities, large tea leaf supply requirements and manufacturing know-how required to produce tea polyphenols to specification. We believe the primary PRC competitors in our industry have production capacity from 100 to 1100 metric tons and compete with us on price, which is determined by our third-party distributors based on market demand. We believe that only a handful of market participants can compete with us on technical specifications, and that this will be an increasingly important area of differentiation as the markets for tea polyphenol-based products expands.

Intellectual Property
 
We have been awarded patents by the PRC government in relation to elements of our production process, and have been recognized as possessing proprietary manufacturing know how for other elements of our production process. We believe these patents and proprietary know-how evidence our manufacturing skill. However, we do not expect to differentiate ourselves in the market with these awards, or believe that receipt of these awards will act as a barrier to entry for our competitors.
Research and Development
 
In addition to ongoing research and development regarding our tea polyphenol extraction and powder process, we are developing our own tea polyphenol-based products. There can be no certainty these efforts will result in the development of a viable product for market. The costs associated with improving our manufacturing process technologies are expensed as incurred in our cost of revenues. Our costs associated with tea polyphenol-based product research and development were $1,255,223 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $31,366 for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Government Regulation
 
Foreign Government Regulation
 
We are subject to numerous PRC national, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and end-of-life handling or disposition of products, and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Although the costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including requirements relating to the restriction of use of hazardous substances in products, have not been material, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits.
Employees
 
As of April 14, 2018 we had 75 full-time employees. Within our workforce as of such date, 12 employees were primarily engaged in marketing, sales and business development, 8 employees were primarily engaged in research and development, 36 employees were engaged in manufacturing, and 19 employees were engaged in general management and administration. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer serve the Company on a part-time basis.
 
Facilities
 
Our business headquarters and production facilities are located in the Industrial Park, Wan’An, Jiangxi Province, PRC, where we have 50 year land use rights, until the year 2063, to a 35,320 square meter tract of land. We have built 5,630 square meters of buildings on this site, housing our first extraction assembly, polyphenol drying and processing clean room, warehouse, showroom, research facility and offices. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs. We further believe that upon completion of ramp up of our facility, we will be the third largest producer of tea polyphenol in the PRC.
