     Primary Operating Divisions and Facilities and Industry Segments
     Chase Corporation, a global specialty chemicals company founded in 1946, is a leading manufacturer of protective materials for high-reliability applications.  Our strategy is to maximize the performance of our core businesses and brands while seeking future opportunities through strategic acquisitions.  We are organized into two reportable operating segments, an Industrial Materials segment and a Construction Materials segment.  The segments are distinguished by the nature of the products we manufacture and how they are delivered to their respective markets. The Industrial Materials segment includes specified products that are used in, or integrated into, another company’s product, with demand typically dependent upon general economic conditions.   The Construction Materials segment is principally composed of project-oriented product offerings that are primarily sold and used as "Chase" branded products.  Our manufacturing facilities are distinct to their respective segments with the exception of our O’Hara Township, PA and Blawnox, PA facilities, which produce products related to both operating segments.  A summary of our operating structure as of August 31, 2018 is as follows:

      Other Business Developments
 On June 25, 2018, the Company announced to its employees the planned closing of its Pawtucket, RI manufacturing facility effective August 31, 2018. This is in line with the Company’s ongoing efforts to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its existing processes. The manufacturing of products previously produced in the Pawtucket, RI facility was moved to Company facilities in Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC during a two-month transition period. The Company expensed $1,272,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the closure, including: (a) cash-related employee-related, logistics and uncapitalized facilities improvement costs of $590,000; and (b) non-cash-related accelerated depreciation expense of $682,000. Future costs related to this move are not anticipated to be significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 On April 20, 2018, Chase finalized an agreement with an unrelated party to sell all inventory, operational machinery and equipment and intangible assets of the Company’s structural composites rod business, as well as a license related to the production and sale of rod, for proceeds of $2,232,000, net of transaction costs and following certain working capital adjustments. This business, which was part of the structural composites product line within the Industrial Materials segment, had limited growth and profitability prospects as part of the Company, and was outside the areas Chase has identified for strategic emphasis. The resulting pre-tax gain on sale of $1,480,000 was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as a gain on sale of businesses within the consolidated statement of operations. Chase received $2,075,000, net of transaction costs, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, with the remaining $157,000 received in the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2018 as a result of a working capital true-up. Chase will provide certain transitional manufacturing and administrative support to the purchaser for which the Company will receive additional consideration upon the performance of services.  The purchaser also entered into a royalty agreement with the Company. The purchaser will make royalty payments to Chase based on future sales of certain structural composite material manufactured by the purchaser.    On December 29, 2017, Chase entered an agreement to acquire Stewart Superabsorbents, LLC (“SSA, LLC”), an advanced superabsorbent polymer (SAP) formulator and solutions provider, with operations located in Hickory and McLeansville, NC. The transaction closed on December 31, 2017. In the most recently completed fiscal year, SSA, LLC, and its recently-acquired Zappa-Tec business (collectively “Zappa Stewart”) had combined revenue in excess of $24,000,000. This acquisition proved to be immediately accretive to the Company’s earnings in the period of acquisition, after adjusting for nonrecurring costs associated with the transaction and financing cost. The business was acquired for a purchase price of $73,469,000 after final working capital adjustments and excluding acquisition-related costs.  As part of this transaction, Chase acquired all assets of the business, and entered multiyear leases at both locations. The Company expensed $393,000 of acquisition-related costs during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.  The purchase was funded from a combination of Chase’s existing revolving credit facility and available cash on hand. Zappa Stewart’s protective materials technology complements Chase’s current specialty chemicals offerings. This acquisition is aligned with the Company’s core strategies and extends its reach into growing medical, environmental and consumer applications. The Company is currently in the process of finalizing purchase accounting, with regard to a final allocation of the purchase price to tangible and identifiable intangible assets assumed and anticipates completion within the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Following the effective date of the acquisition the financial results of Zappa Stewart’s operations have been included in the Company’s financial statements in the specialty chemical intermediates product line, contained within the Industrial Materials operating segment. 
 On April 3, 2017, Chase executed an agreement with an unrelated party to sell all inventory, machinery and equipment and intangible assets of the Company’s fiber optic cable components product line for proceeds of $3,858,000 net of transaction costs and following certain working capital adjustments. The resulting pre-tax gain on sale of $2,013,000 was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as gain on sale of businesses within the consolidated statement of operations.  Further, the purchaser entered a multiyear lease for a portion of the manufacturing space at the Company’s Granite Falls, NC facility. Chase will provide certain transitional manufacturing and administrative support to the purchaser for which the Company will receive additional consideration upon the performance of services. The Company’s fiber optic cable components product line was formerly a part of the Company’s Industrial Materials operating segment.
 On September 30, 2016, the Company acquired certain assets of Resin Designs, LLC (“Resin Designs”), an advanced adhesives and sealants manufacturer, with locations in Woburn, MA and Newark, CA. The business was acquired for a purchase price of $30,270,000 after final working capital adjustments and excluding acquisition-related costs. As part of this transaction, Chase acquired all working capital and fixed assets of the business, and entered multiyear leases at both locations. The Company expensed $584,000 of acquisition-related costs during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 associated with this acquisition. The purchase was funded entirely with available cash on hand. Resin Designs is a formulator of customized adhesive and sealant systems used in high-reliability electronic applications. The acquisition broadens the Company’s adhesives and sealants product offering and manufacturing capabilities, and expands its market reach. Since the effective date of the acquisition, the financial results of Resin Designs’ operations have been included in the Company’s financial statements within the electronic and industrial coatings product line, contained within the Industrial Materials operating segment. 
 On June 23, 2016, the Company acquired all the capital stock of Spray Products (India) Private Limited for $1,161,000, net of cash acquired. This acquired business works closely with our HumiSeal® coating manufacturing operation in Winnersh, Wokingham, England. The acquisition in India enhances the Company’s ability to provide technical, sales, manufacturing, chemical handling, and packaging services in the region. Since the effective date for this acquisition, the financial results of the business have been included in the Company's financial statements within the Company’s Industrial Materials operating segment in the electronic and industrial coatings product line.

 There is some seasonality in selling products into the construction market. Higher demand is often experienced when temperatures are warmer in most of North America (April through October), with lower demand occurring when temperatures are colder (typically our second fiscal quarter).  Other than the acquisition of Zappa Stewart, we did not introduce any new products requiring an investment of a material amount of our assets during fiscal year 2018.
     Employees
     As of September 30, 2018, we employed approximately 769 people (including union employees).  We consider our employee relations to be good.  In the U.S., we offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive relative to others in our industry. In our operations outside the U.S., we offer benefits that may vary from those offered to our U.S. employees due to customary local practices and statutory requirements.     Backlog, Customers and Competition
     As of October 31, 2018, the backlog of customer orders believed to be firm was approximately $21,825,000.  This compared with a backlog of $19,719,000 as of October 31, 2017.  The increase in backlog from the prior year amount is primarily due to current period inclusion of the fiscal 2018 acquired Zappa Stewart business. During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, no customer accounted for more than 10% of sales.  No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination of profits or contracts at the election of the United States Federal Government.
     There are other companies that manufacture or sell products and services similar to those made and sold by us.  Many of those companies are larger and have greater financial resources than we have.  We compete principally on the basis of technical performance, service reliability, quality and price.  
     Raw Materials
     We obtain raw materials from a wide variety of suppliers, with alternative sources of most essential materials available within reasonable lead times.
     Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions        We own the following trademarks that we believe are of material importance to our business: Chase Corporation®, C-Spray (Logo), a trademark used in conjunction with most of the Company’s business segment and product line marketing material and communications; HumiSeal®, a trademark for moisture protective coatings sold to the electronics industry; Chase & Sons®, a trademark for barrier and insulating tapes sold to the wire and cable industry; Chase BLH2OCK®, a trademark for a water-blocking compound sold to the wire and cable industry; Rosphalt50®, a trademark for an asphalt additive used predominantly on bridge decks for waterproofing protection; PaperTyger®, a trademark for laminated durable papers sold to the envelope converting and commercial printing industries; DuraDocument®, a trademark for durable, laminated papers sold to the digital print industry; Defender® a trademarked and patent-pending RFID protective material sold to the personal accessories and paper industries; Tapecoat®, a trademark for corrosion preventive surface coatings and primers; Maflowrap®, a trademark for anti-corrosive tapes incorporating self-adhesive mastic or rubber-backed strips, made of plastic materials;  Royston®, a trademark for a corrosion-inhibiting coating composition for use on pipes; Ceva®, a trademark for epoxy pastes/gels/mortars and elastomeric concrete used in the construction industry; CIM® trademarks for fluid-applied coating and lining systems used in the water and wastewater industry; ServiWrap® trademarks for pipeline protection tapes, coatings and accessories; NEPTCO®, a trademark used in conjunction with most of NEPTCO’s business and product line marketing material and communications; NEPTAPE®, a trademark for coated shielding and insulation materials used in the wire and cable industry; Muletape®, a trademark for pulling and installation tapes sold to the telecommunications industry; Trace-Safe®, a trademark for detection tapes sold to the telecommunications and water and gas utilities industries; Dualite®, a trademark for polymeric microspheres utilized for density and weight reduction and sound dampening by various industries; 4EvaSeal®, a trademark for adhesive-backed tape utilized in various industries; Resin Designs®,  a trademark for adhesives and sealants sold into the microelectronics and semiconductor industries; SlickTape®, a trademark for a lubricated shielding tape sold to the wire and cable industry; and HighDraw®, a trademark for a highly extensible shielding tape sold to the wire and cable

industry.  We do not have any other material trademarks, licenses, franchises, or concessions.  While we do hold various patents, as well as other trademarks, we do not believe that they are material to the success of our business.
     Working Capital
     We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows generated from operations.  In addition, our revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities.  We have historically funded acquisitions through both available cash on hand and additional borrowings and financing agreements with our bank lenders.     Research and Development
     Approximately $3,940,000, $3,696,000 and $2,792,000 was expensed for Company-sponsored research and development during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.  Research and development increased by $244,000 in fiscal 2018 due to continued focused development work on strategic product lines, including eight months of operations related to the established research and development department of Zappa Stewart, acquired in second quarter of fiscal 2018, and twelve months of operations related to the established research and development department of Resin Designs, acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
