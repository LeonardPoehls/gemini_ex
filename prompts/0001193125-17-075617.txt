 The Lighting Industry 
 The global lighting industry is a component of the electrical portion of the global construction industry. Construction opportunities can be further segmented into two categories  new construction (new work) and retro-fit construction (re-work). Generally the lighting industry focuses on three market segments: commercial, industrial/outdoor and residential. Within these three market segments exist two product categories: fixtures and lamps (more commonly known as light bulbs outside the lighting industry). The fixtures category includes all apparatuses, luminaires and power/heat-control systems, while lamps consist of the replaceable devices that emit light. Both categories historically have incorporated multiple source options which include conventional lamps such as incandescent, fluorescent and high-intensity discharge (HID) products. For residential applications within the general illumination market, inexpensive incandescent and, to a lesser extent, compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs have been the preferred choice. For commercial applications, metrics show that the more expensive and long-lasting fluorescent and HID bulbs and fixtures have the largest market share at this time.

With rapid advancements in the performance, efficiency and the reduction in cost of energy-efficient lighting, including LED-based solutions, conventional light sources are beginning to be replaced by advanced technologies with lower operating costs over their useful lives. In addition, the energy-efficient nature of LED technology makes it an environmentally friendly light source, and the compact size of LEDs has created new possibilities in lighting fixture and lamp design. Product selection is influenced by a number of factors, including overall cost, energy efficiency, product life, lumen output and other product features, as well as regulatory, maintenance and environmental factors. We believe our unique advanced lighting solutions are well positioned to increasingly displace conventional lighting in each of our targeted markets. 
 In North America, lighting manufacturers/product providers sell products through multiple channels, including independent manufacturers representatives, electrical supply and distribution companies, and ESCOs. These channel partners then market products to electrical contractors, general contractors and, at times, directly to the end-user. In addition to having direct contact and relationships with the local channel partners, representatives also have direct contact with lighting designers, electrical engineers, architects and general contractors that influence buying decisions. The manufacturers representatives often provide value-added services, such as product promotion or design and implementation assistance. The ability of smaller companies to compete against larger more-established rivals is heavily rooted in their capacity to leverage their unique product portfolios and customer service to garner maximum productivity from each representative. 
 LED Lighting Industry Trends 
 LEDs are semiconductor-based devices that generate light. As the cost of LEDs decreases while performance improves, combined with increased consumer education, we expect this lighting technology will continue to compete more effectively in the general illumination market versus traditional lighting. We believe the LED lighting industry is experiencing the following trends: 
 High Energy Costs Drive LED Adoption. As a result of rising electricity prices, particularly within dense urban areas already impacted by high energy costs, businesses and consumers seek new technologies to reduce energy consumption. LED lighting technology is one of the fastest growing opportunities to generate significant savings and quick returns on investment. LEDs used within residential and multi-family developments, especially ENERGY STAR rated products, use at least 75% less energy and last 25 times longer than incandescent lighting. Based on the percentage of a buildings energy usage consumed by lighting (20% commercial and 10% residential), industry experts believe that the widespread use of LED lighting has the greatest potential impact on energy savings in the United States. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, by 2027, widespread use of LEDs could save about 348 terawatt hours compared to non-LED use of electricity, which is a total savings of more than $30 billion over the next 10 years at todays electricity prices. 
 Technological Maturity: LED lighting is one of todays most energy-efficient and rapidly-developing lighting technologies. The technological advancement to LED lighting has achieved commercial viability in terms of brightness, efficiency, lamp life, safety, maintenance reduction and color-rendering (CRI). This maturity continues to drive growing market adoption. 
 Reduced Costs: Market forces, including competitive pressure, greater manufacturing efficiencies, and increased technology adoption among businesses and consumers, continue to reduce LED lamp prices. As a result, the global lighting market is experiencing increased LED adoption. 
 Superior Efficiency: Since the introduction of the first visible LED in the 1960,s, the technology has offered an increasingly wide variety of colored lighting, beginning with red and expanding to green, yellow and orange. Initial rudimentary applications included traffic lights, automotive brake lights and indicator lights. In the mid-1990s, LEDs became capable of emitting blue light. With the advent of blue LEDs, combined with phosphor technology, LEDs made another technological leap by emitting white light. This breakthrough enabled LEDs, through full color spectrum output capabilities, to compete with preferred color temperatures achieved by traditional lighting solutions for applications in commercial, industrial and residential markets. In an effort to lower energy consumption, lighting companies are focusing on increasing lumens per watt. Lumens per watt (often referred to as efficacy) is an industry standard that measures the amount of light emitted per watt of electrical power used, meaning the more lumens per watt, the more energy-efficient the product. Typical incandescent light sources produce between 15 and 25 lumens per watt, while fluorescent and HID light sources can produce output between 85 and 100 lumens per watt. Today, high-performing LEDs currently perform at 160 lumens per watt, delivering the highest efficiency light source to the market, and the U.S. Department of Energy projects that a target of 250 lumens per watt can be reached. 
 Governmental Influence: U.S. government regulation continues to drive efficiency, requiring greater standards among many lighting products today. Such initiatives by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agencys Energy Star Certification Program set industry-wide standards for lighting products that outline efficiency and performance criteria, helping manufacturers promote their products while enhancing consumer awareness and education, allowing for more informed decisions when purchasing lighting products.

Local governments are also adopting regulations to address greater energy efficiency standards to reduce demand on existing energy infrastructure and limit requirements for new sources of power, while meeting obligations to improve social responsibility and environmental conservation standards, including air and water quality. Mandates requiring greater efficiency are often combined with divestment of energy sources to include more sources of alternate and renewable forms of energy generation, including solar, wind, cogeneration, geothermal and fuel cell technologies. State and federal tax incentives continue to provide a significant rational to support the growing adoption of these renewable and energy efficiency technologies. This net effect translates into reduced energy grid demand, particularly during times of peak energy demand, which often rely on older and dirtier forms of energy generation, typically from coal power plants and other less efficient facilities. 
 Increased Incentive: Demand on the existing power grid in the United States continues to rise. This increased demand creates unique challenges for municipalities and energy providers in order to generate more power. Extensive investments to expand capacity, construct new facilities, and upgrade aging infrastructure are combined with costly and time-consuming regulatory approval processes, community and environmental challenges, and extended construction periods. As a result, many state government agencies, working in conjunction with the utility companies, provide incentives through the form of credits and rebates to help manage or reduce consumer demand. As LED lighting technology matures, more utilities are now offering incentives and rebate programs toward the installation of LED lighting to reduce upfront costs and improve return on investment. In an effort to encourage the development of high-quality, energy-efficient commercial LED lamps eligible for utility rebates, the Design Lights Consortium (the DLC) was created. This organization works to establish rigorous performance standards for the LED lighting industry. LED products that meet DLCs standards become listed on its qualified products list, making them eligible for substantial rebates from utility companies. 
 Customer Acceptance: LEDs are rapidly gaining popularity as consumer education and awareness of LED technologies matures. Early adoption of this technology has shown positive results, including reduced lifetime energy and maintenance costs to achieve quick return on investment, typically less than three years. These case studies have elevated market confidence, resulting in greater customer motivation to utilize LED lighting solutions. Additionally, based on McKinsey & Companys 2012 study of the Solid State Lighting (LED) market, it concluded that LED Lighting would be the most viable energy efficiency opportunity by 2020. 
 Social Responsibility: LED lighting solutions provide a significant opportunity for individuals, corporations and governments to meet environmental goals. LEDs do not contain mercury, unlike fluorescent lighting, which can be harmful to the environment, do not emit ultraviolet radiation (UV), typically do not contain glass, and are 100% recyclable. 
 Retrofit Focus: The energy savings and positive environmental impact of LED technology in both commercial and residential applications are increasing the market size of retrofit and renovation as compared to new construction. We believe we are experts in both retrofit and renovation. Retrofit consists of the replacement of a luminaire or lamp, one for one, without changing the location or type of luminaire. Renovation consists of redesign of the existing space with LED, potentially using new luminaires in a different location, and possibly adding a control system to further enhance the environment and the energy savings. There are billions of sockets currently operating with traditional light sources that we believe will be converted to LED.

Sales and Marketing 
 We design, manufacture, market and sell LED solutions; we believe that we furnish exceptional customer service and the highest-quality LED products available for commercial installation. Our Value Lighting and All Around divisions also sell conventional and LED based lighting products in the multifamily market based on customer needs. In recent years, we have seen the use of LED solutions within multi-family projects increase significantly, and believe this trend will continue as developers and property managers look to reduce energy and maintenance expenses, while increasing the quality of lighting throughout their projects. 
 We market and sell our LED products through our internal sales force, a national dealer and distribution network, and our commercial agency networks, as well as through our ESCOs focus. Through our Revolution Lighting Group division, we continue our expansion of distribution channels to include independent sales agents and representatives, distributors, ESCOs and direct sales. Generally, our distributors, dealers and agencies are recruited, trained and monitored by us directly. 
 We promote our brands and products through print media, online media, trade shows and educational seminars. Our advertising is geared toward lead generation, distributor and dealer recruitment, brand awareness and end-user acceptance of LED technology. We maintain an in-house channel management team that supports our distributor and dealer base. As we grow, we plan to grow our team to manage their accounts and give them the support they need to build their business and promote the brands we own. 
 Manufacturing and Suppliers 
 We design and engineer our products, and we outsource a significant portion of the manufacture and assembly of our products to a number of contract manufacturers both domestically and internationally. These contract manufacturers purchase components that we specify, and provide the necessary facilities and labor to manufacture our products. We leverage the strength of the contract manufacturers, and allocate the manufacturing of specific products to the contract manufacturer best suited to the task. Quality control and lot testing is conducted in our facilities in Simi Valley, California where we also assemble and manufacture certain of our products. These facilities are also dedicated to assemble products that satisfy the definition of Made in America.
Some of our products use a custom LED package and are sourced from a limited number of suppliers. Although we currently are dependent on these suppliers, we believe that, if necessary, alternative sources of supply could be found. However, any interruption or delay at our third-party manufacturers or in the supply of the components, or in our ability to obtain components from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Research and Product Development 
 We pride ourselves on delivering the highest quality lighting products. Our research and development team is focused on the design and integration of electronics, optics and thermal management solutions to create advanced lighting solutions. Through these efforts, we seek to enhance our existing products, design new products, and develop solutions for customer applications. We believe that quick responsiveness to customer demands and our ability to achieve industry certifications such as UL, DLC and Energy Star for certain products differentiates us from many of our competitors, as we rapidly introduce new products to address market needs. 
 During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we spent $2.4 million, $2.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, on research and product development activities. We continue to invest in our product development, prototypes and specifications as we believe that increased levels of spending on research and development will be necessary to successfully develop advanced lighting products that will have the brightness of traditional lighting systems while being offered at acceptable prices. 
 Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 Protection of our proprietary intellectual property is important to our business. At December 31, 2016, we held 26 U.S. patents and 4 foreign patents, and had 4 patent applications currently filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or with the World Intellectual Property Organization or foreign patent offices. 
 Although we expect that several of our patent applications will issue, we cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. In addition, despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 
 
9 
 
Royalties 
 We have, from time to time, entered into agreements whereby we have agreed to pay royalties for the use of certain LED technologies. Royalty expense incurred under these agreements was immaterial for all years presented. 
Regulations, Standards and Conventions 
 Our products are generally required to meet the electrical codes of the jurisdictions in which they are sold. Meeting the typically more stringent codes established in the United States and the European Union usually allows our products to meet the codes in other geographic regions. 
 Many of our customers require that our products be listed by UL. UL is a U.S., independent, nationally recognized testing laboratory and certification organization. UL develops standards and test procedures for products, materials, components, assemblies, tools and equipment, chiefly dealing with product safety. UL evaluates products, components, materials, systems for compliance to specific requirements, and it permits acceptable products to carry a UL certification mark, as long as they remain compliant with the standards. UL offers several categories of certification. Products that are UL Listed, are identified by the distinctive UL mark. Many of our LED lighting products are UL-listed.
Today, many of our customers and end-users also expect our products to meet the applicable DLC or Energy Star requirements. DLC and Energy Star are industry standards for energy-efficient lighting products. To qualify for Energy Star certification, LED lighting products must pass a variety of rigorous tests to prove that the products have certain performance and efficiency characteristics. Four of our former Array-branded lamps were among the first lamps to be certified under the Energy Star program, which began accepting applications for lamps in September 2010. A variety of our LED products are DLC-listed, too, making them eligible for valuable rebates from utility companies. As of March 1, 2016, the DLC lists 793 Revolution Lighting Technologies LED products on its Qualified Products List. Like Energy Star, DLC sets stringent product performance and efficiency requirements that manufacturers must meet to qualify for certification. In fact, DLC bases many of its performance requirements on the Energy Star model. However, unlike Energy Star, which primarily regulates products for the residential lighting market, DLC regulates lighting products manufactured for the commercial market. By designing and manufacturing LED products that meet DLC, Energy Star and UL standards, we expect to further improve our sales and industry reputation. 
 Seasonality 
 The business exhibits some seasonality, with net sales being affected by the impact of weather and seasonal demand on construction and installation programs, particularly during the winter months. Because of these seasonal factors, we have experienced, and generally expect to experience, increasing revenue as the year progresses. 
 Our lighting solutions are sold to customers in both the new construction, as well as renovation and retrofit markets. The construction market is cyclical in nature and subject to change in general economic conditions. Work performed within the public education sector, including schools and universities, mainly occurs during the summer months when classes are not in session. Unit sales volume has a major impact on our profitability. Economic downturns and the potential decline in key construction markets may have a material effect on the net sales and operating income. 
 Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations 
 Financial information by geographic region is set forth in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental Protection Regulations 
 We believe that compliance with environmental protection regulations will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 300 full-time employees. We enjoy good employee relations. Our employees are not members of any labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.
