Item 1 and 2. | Business and Properties 
--------------+----------------------------

 
Samson Oil & Gas Limited (“we”, “Samson” or the “Company”) is a company limited by shares, incorporated on April 6, 1979 under the laws of Australia.  Our principal business is the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties in the United States. 
 
Pending Asset Sale
 
In June 2018, we signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of the Foreman Butte Project, subject to our retention of a 15% working interest in a portion of the Project (the “Foreman Butte Sale”). This transaction received shareholder approval at a general meeting held on August 13, 2018. The purchase price is $40 million with an effective date of January 1, 2018. The sale is currently scheduled to close on October 15, 2018.
 
The Foreman Butte Project constitutes the majority of our operating assets. Upon closing of the transaction, we will retain a 15% working interest in certain wells in the Home Run Field, which consists of 15 producing wells and 20 PUD locations, the first of which is expected to be drilled soon after the sale closing.
 
The proceeds of the Foreman Butte Sale will be used to repay our credit facility with Mutual of Omaha Bank in full and bring our other accounts payable current. We estimate that after these repayments, we will have no outstanding debt and will retain $6.5 million in cash proceeds from the sale.
 
Prior Transactions
 
In March 2016, we acquired the Foreman Butte Project, comprised of a number of producing and non-producing, operated and non-operated properties in the Ratcliffe and Madison formations in North Dakota and Montana. The purchase price was $16.0 million (before post-closing settlement adjustments) and following a review of the fair market value of the assets and liabilities on the closing date of the transaction, we recorded a bargain purchase gain of $10.7 million. This acquisition was financed through an extension in our credit facility with Mutual of Omaha Bank of $11.5 million and a $4.0 million promissory note provided to the seller of the assets. This note was repaid in May 2017 through a term note facility from Mutual of Omaha Bank.
 
On June 30, 2016 we signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of our North Stockyard project in North Dakota. The sale price was $15 million and closed on October 31, 2016. $11.5 million of the proceeds from this transaction was used to pay down our credit facility with Mutual of Omaha Bank. The remaining proceeds were used to rebalance our hedge book, following the sale of a portion of our production, and for working capital.
 
In May 2017, we closed on the sale of our State GC assets in New Mexico. The sale price of $1.2 million was applied to pay down our current facility with Mutual of Omaha Bank. In June 2017, Samson and Mutual of Omaha Bank agreed to extend both the $4 million term loan and our $19.45 million reserve base facility until October 2018. The previous maturity date was October 31, 2017.
 
Our reserve report estimates that we had proved oil and gas reserves valued at approximately $47.7 million (before taxes) based on a present value calculation with 10% discounting rate. This present value as of June 30, 2018, utilizes an adjusted realized pricing of $57.67 per Bbl for oil and $0.91 per Mcf for natural gas. As of June 30, 2018, 92% of our proved reserves were oil and 74% was proved developed producing, 16% were proved non producing and 9% was proved undeveloped. 87% is included in the sale which is expected to be closed on October 15, 2018 according to the most recent amendment of the Purchase and Sale Agreement signed on September 28th.

Business Strategy
 
Before and after the Foreman Butte Sale, our business strategy is to create a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by exploring for, acquiring and developing oil and natural gas resources in the United States.  Our primary financial goal is to develop profitably our oil properties while maintaining a strong balance sheet, and specifically to focus on the exploration, exploitation and development of our major project – our retained 15% working interest in the Home Run Field within the Foreman Butte Project in Montana and North Dakota.
Reporting and Financials
 
We became required to file our periodic reports to the SEC as a U.S. domestic issuer as of July 1, 2011. Since we remain an Australian corporation, however, we are still considered to be a domestic company in Australia as well.  As a result, we are required to report our financial results in the U.S. using U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and in Australia using International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).

Preparation of Reserves Estimates
 
Given the pending sale at June 30, 2018, our fiscal year-end petroleum reserves report was prepared internally by knowledgeable officers and employees of the Company for the current year. The report was based upon our internal review of the property interests being appraised, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sales of production, geoscience and engineering data, and other information we gather. We prepared our estimates by use of standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry.  Reserve volumes and values were determined under the method prescribed by the SEC, which requires the application of the 12-month average price for natural gas and oil calculated as the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month prior period to the end of the reporting period and year-end costs. The proved reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.  
 
Our reserves were prepared by a practitioner with 22 years of industry experience in geologic and engineering review and analysis and a Bachelor of Science in Geological Engineering from Colorado School of Mines. Additionally, the Chief Executive Officer, Terry Barr, is responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Company’s reserves report. The CEO is a petroleum geologist who holds an associateship in applied geology and has over 45 years of relevant experience in the oil and gas industry.
 
The reserve estimates are reported to the Board of Directors, at least annually. Our Board members have experience in reviewing and understanding reserve estimates.
 
According to our June 30, 2018 reserve report we had proved oil and gas reserves valued at approximately $47.7 million (before taxes) based on a present value calculation with 10% discounting rate. This present value as of June 30, 2018, utilizes an adjusted realized pricing of $57.67 per Bbl for oil and $2.91 per Mcf for natural gas. As of June 30, 2018, 92% of our proved reserves were oil and 74% was proved developed producing, 16% were proved non producing and 9% was proved undeveloped. 87% is included in the sale which is expected to be closed on October 15, 2018 according to the most recent amendment of the Purchase and Sale Agreement signed on September 28th.
 
Estimated Proved Reserves
 
The information set forth below regarding our oil and gas reserves for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was prepared internally.
 
The information set forth below regarding our oil and gas reserves for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 was prepared by Netherland Sewell.  
 
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. Proved reserves are categorized as either developed or undeveloped.

Revisions of previous quantity estimates
 
The downward revision recorded during the year from July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 related to our drilling plan for our PUD locations. During the year ended June 30, 2016, we anticipated drilling them as new 10,000 foot lateral horizontal wells. Upon further technical review, we now plan to drill the PUD wells as 5,000 foot laterals out of an existing well bore. The shortening of the lateral length lead to a decrease in the volume of reserves associated with these PUDs.
 
The downward movement in the current year relates to our sale of an interest in our PUDs. Due to the continued lack of capital available to drill these PUDs, the decision was made to sell substantially all of the wells in the Foreman Butte project area. We have retained a 15% working interest in certain PUDs and we have recognized that value in our reserves at June 30, 2018.
 
Sales of Reserves in Place
 
The reserves held for sale relate to the sale of the majority of our interest in the Foreman Butte project. This sale is expected to close on October 15, 2018.
 
The sale of reserves in place during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 consists of proved reserves (net of production prior to sale) in the North Stockyard field in North Dakota and the State GC field in New Mexico. All reserves were proved developed producing.

Proved Developed Producing Reserves
 
At June 30, 2018 our proved developed producing reserves primarily relate to our working interest in producing wells in our Foreman Butte project area in North Dakota and Montana.
Proved Developed Not Producing (PDNP)
 
PDNP reserves are those estimated proved reserves expected to be recovered from existing wells where a workover is required to re-establish production
 
As of June 30, 2017, the PDNP reserves were 171 MBOE. This primarily related to wells that require a workover to commence production again. This work will be performed as capital allows.
 
As of June 30, 2018, the PDNP reserves were 39 MBOE. The smaller number is attributable to our smaller retained interest in the Foreman Butte project after the proposed sale.
 
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
 
Proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs) are those reserves expected to be recovered from new wells on undeveloped acreage.
 
Due to the continued lack of capital available to drill these PUDs, the decision was made to sell substantially all of the wells in the Foreman Butte project area. Upon closing the proposed sale, we will retain a 15% working interest in certain PUDs and we have recognized that value in our reserves at June 30, 2018 because, following the sale, we will have the working capital available to develop these locations.
 
During the year ended June 30, 2017, through further technical review, we changed our plan with respect to the drilling the PUDs. This reduced the reserves volumes associated with the PUDs but did not change the reserve value associated with the PUDs due to a decrease in the estimated drilling costs. We obtained the permits to drill 4 PUDs and commenced sourcing the appropriate rig and other contractors and equipment required but did not obtain the necessary capital to develop them, leading to our decision to sell the Foreman Butte Project containing those PUDs.
 
While we did not convert any PUDs during the year ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, we have made considerable progress on their development through the increased technical review and the determination of the most efficient and cost effective way to drill them. The sale of a portion of the Foreman Butte project will provide us the capital in order to participate in the drilling of these PUD locations.
 
Production, Prices, Costs and Balance Sheet Information
 
Production
 
The results from discontinued operations are not included in the results below.
 
During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we produced 6,021and 61,516 barrels of oil, respectively.  During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 we produced 7,284 and 434,998 Mcf of gas, respectively.
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 we had one Field (as such term is used within the meaning of applicable regulations of the SEC – See Glossary of Technical Terms), excluding discontinued operations that contains more than 15% of our total proved reserves, namely our interests in the Home Runfield in North Dakota, which is part of our Foreman Butte project in North Dakota and Montana.

All of our acreage positions are located in the continental United States, with the majority located in North Dakota and Montana.  We have extensive leases with a variety of remaining lease terms varying from 3 months to four years.  95% of our net developed acres are held by production.  In some cases we have the ability to extend the lease term.
 
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
 
Future hydrocarbon sales and production and development costs have been estimated using a 12-month average price for the commodity prices for June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 and costs in effect at the end of the periods indicated. The 12-month historical average of the first of the month prices used for natural gas for June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 were $2.91 and $3.01per Mcf, respectively. The 12-month historical average of the first of the month prices used for oil for June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 were $57.67 and $48.95 per barrel of oil, respectively.  Future cash flows were reduced by estimated future development, abandonment and production costs based on period–end costs.  No deductions were made for general overhead, depletion, depreciation and amortization or any indirect costs.  All cash flows are discounted at 10%.
 
Changes in demand for hydrocarbons, inflation and other factors make such estimates inherently imprecise and subject to substantial revisions.  This table should not be construed to be an estimate of current market value of the proved reserves attributable to Samson.
 
The following table shows the estimated standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved reserves (in US$’000’s):
 

 | As at June 30, | 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+--------
 | 2018 | | | 2017 |

Developed Properties
 
Foreman Butte Project – Williston Basin, North Dakota and Montana
 Various working interests
 
In March 2016, we closed on the acquisition of the Foreman Butte project. This project includes a number of producing and non producing, operated and non operated wells in the Ratcliffe and Madison formations in Montana and North Dakota.
 
This project consists of 131 wells (both operated and non operated) across a number of fields in Montana and North Dakota. The wells are conventional wells drilled as early as 1980 to as recently as 2010.
 
In June 2018, we signed a purchase and sale agreement to sell the majority of this project for $40 million, with an effective date of January 1, 2018. This transaction is currently expected to close on October 15, 2018. Under the purchase and sale agreement, we will retain a 15% working interest in certain wells within the Home Run field.
 
The Home Run Field (aka as the Foreman Butte Field) is the largest area oil field in our portfolio. It was developed on a 640 acre spacing pattern and our engineering and geologic analyses have determined that only 3.2% of the original oil in place has been recovered to date. Given that oil fields typically recover up to around 20% of their oil in place there would appear to be significant un-developed oil to be recovered from this field.
 
This has been confirmed through the use of a 3 dimensional numerical simulation of the reservoir volume, and the expected production curve for these wells has been developed from the resulting numerical model.
 
The current reservoir pressure has also been established using a field wide fluid level study, and the initial development wells will be located in areas of demonstrated higher pressure.
 
Upon closing the sale of these assets, the buyer of the project is expected to commence drilling the first of 20 identified PUD locations in the first quarter of 2019. We will have a 15% working interest in this well and any future Ratcliffe and Madison wells drilled in this field.
 

10
--

 

Currently we have 20 Ratcliffe PUD locations identified. The second lateral well expected to be drilled by the purchaser of the assets will test an undeveloped reservoir in the Mission Canyon Formation of the Mississippian Madison Group. Although we can make no assurances of the results of this drilling, we are optimistic about its prospects. It is possible that.this lateral could prove up a new oil field with the potential for many additional well locations (up to 20 vertical wells or 8 drill-out laterals), A 3,500 acre 4-way structural closure has already been mapped from the abundance of existing well control in the area.
 
These PUDs meet the definition of PUDS per the SPE PRMS guidelines and SEC definitions and have been risked accordingly.
 
In September 2017, we received approval for a water flood pilot project for the Home Run Field utilizing an existing wellbore which is located on the flank of the field and which is non-productive. This well, the Mays 1-20H has been tested and readied for injected water following the approval from the North Dakota Industrial Commission. We commenced injection in October 2017. The water flood is being used to add pressure to the reservoir which we believe should enhance the recovery of oil. The well performance in the offsetting wells will be monitored to establish the viability of the flood. The water being used is produced formation water so that there is no chemical compatibility issues, in essence the water is being returned to the reservoir from which it originated. The water is currently being trucked to the injector from the existing producing wells.
 
During the year ended June 30, 2018, the Foreman Butte Project, excluding discontinued operations, produced 2,191 barrels of oil.
 
North Stockyard Project – Williston Basin, North Dakota
 
On June 30, 2016 we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell our North Stockyard property for $15 million. This transaction closed on October 31, 2016.
 
State GC Oil and Gas Field, New Mexico

The State GC Oil and Gas Field, located in Lea County, New Mexico, was discovered in 1980 and covers approximately 600 acres.  The field is operated by Legacy Resources.
 
The State GC# 1 well was drilled in 1980 and has been productive since that time.
 
This project was sold for $1.2 million on April 30, 2017.
 
Exploration / Undeveloped Properties
 
Hawk Springs Project, Goshen County, Wyoming
 37.5% -100% working interest
 
Spirit of America US 34 #2-29 (Spirit of America II)
 100% working interest
 
The Spirit of America I replacement well, Spirit of America II, was drilled to a total depth of 10,634 feet using a conservative drilling approach to penetrate the troublesome salt section along with heavy weight, oil based mud. Numerous operational difficulties were encountered and the well failed to produce economic quantities of hydrocarbons. $7.3 million in costs associated to drill this well, were written off to the Statement of Operations in the year ended June 30, 2013.
 
In July 2015, a workover rig was moved to the location to test the Dakota formation from 8,054 feet to 8,064 feet. This formation was found to be water saturated and no hydrocarbons were noted. All costs associated with this well have been written off to the Income Statement during the year ended June 30, 2016.
 
This well was plugged in October 2016.
 
Defender US 33 #2-29H
 37.5% working interest
 
This well commenced production in February 2012 and has experienced numerous operational and pumping issues. In July 2012, the well was cleaned out and resumed pumping. In June 2015, the well was struck by lightning which affected the electronic controllers associated with the well. These controllers have yet to be repaired due to the well’s low productivity rate.
 
There was no production from this well during the year ended June 30, 2016. This well was plugged in October 2016.

Bluff 1-11 (25% working interest)
 
During the year ended June 30, 2014 we drilled the Bluff Prospect to test multiple targets in the Permian and Pennsylvanian sections in a 4-way structural trapping configuration. The Bluff #1-11 well reached a total depth of 8,900 feet after intersecting the pre-Cambrian basement on June 13, 2014.
 
To date, this well has failed to produce economic quantities of hydrocarbons and all costs associated with drilling it have been written off the Statement of Operations. The well is yet to be plugged as we are waiting on testing the upper canyon spring zone with a perforation and swab test. It is unlikely that this operation will take place and a proposal for abandonment is being prepared for consideration by the other working interest owners. It is expected that this well will be plugged during the year ended June 30, 2019.
 
Roosevelt Project, Roosevelt County, Montana
 100% Working Interest
 
Australia II
 100% working interest
 
In December 2011, we drilled Australia II in the Roosevelt Project, our first appraisal (exploratory) well in this project area. This well was drilled to a total measured depth of 14,972 feet with the horizontal lateral remaining within the target zone for the entire lateral length. Oil and gas shows were returned during the drilling of this well and approximately 3,425 barrels of oil were produced. This well was being pumped, and although this well was productive, we did not believe that we would be able to recover our costs associated with drilling it. We expensed $13.1 million of previously capitalized exploration expenditure in the Statement of Operations as deferred exploration expenditure written off, which represents 100% of the costs incurred to June 30, 2012.
 
This well was plugged during the year ended June 30, 2018.
 
Rainbow Project, Williams County, North Dakota Mississippian Bakken Formation, Williston Basin 
 23% -52% working interest
 
During the year ended June 30, 2013, we acquired, in two tranches, a net 950 acres in two 1,280 acre drilling units located in the Rainbow Project, Williams County, North Dakota. The Rainbow Project is located in Sections 17, 18, 19 and 20 in T158N R99W.
 
The acquisition involved an acreage trade by the parties and a future carry of the vendor by us in the initial drilling program on the Rainbow Project. We transferred 160 net acres from our 1,200 acre undeveloped acreage holding in North Stockyard and the vendor will fund its share (between 7.5% and 8.5%) of the North Stockyard initial infill program. We have acquired 950 net acres in the Rainbow Project from the vendor for this acreage trade and have paid $1 million to the vendor, in lieu of a carry as we did not spud a well within the desired time frame. $0.6 million of this payment was made prior to June 30, 2015 with the remaining $0.4 million paid during the year ended June 30, 2016.
 
In the western drilling unit of the acquired acreage, we hold a 52.21% working interest. In the eastern drilling unit, our interest is 23%.
 
Our first Rainbow well, Gladys 1-20, drilled by Continental Resources, spud on June 28, 2014 and was drilled to a total depth of 19,994 feet. The well is 1,280 acre lateral (approximately 10,000 feet) in the middle member of the Bakken formation.
 
There has been no further drilling activity on this lease during the prior year and 652 acres have expired.
 
Cane Creek Project, Grand & San Juan Counties, Utah
 Pennsylvanian Paradox Formation, Paradox Basin
 100% working interest
 
On November 5, 2014, we entered into an Other Business Arrangement (“OBA”) with the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (“SITLA”) covering approximately 8,080 gross/net acres located in Grand and San Juan Counties, Utah, all of which are administered by SITLA. We were granted an option period for two years, expiring November 30th, 2016 in order to enter into a Multiple Mineral Development Agreement (“MMDA”) with another company who hold leases to extract potash in an acreage position situated within our project area. Upon entering into the MMDA, SITLA would be obligated to deliver oil and gas leases covering our project area at a cost of $75 per acre to us. The MMDA has been finalized though it has not yet been executed. We paid an additional option fee in November 2016 to extend our option to November 30th, 2017. This option expired unexercised in November 2017.

Risk and Insurance Program
 
Our operations are subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including the risk of well blowouts, oil spills and other adverse events. We could be held responsible for injuries suffered by third parties, contamination, property damage or other losses resulting from these types of events. In addition, we have generally agreed to indemnify our drilling rig contractors against certain of these types of losses. Because of these risks, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the potential risks affecting our operations and in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be economic. Our insurance program is designed to provide us with what we believe to be an economically appropriate level of financial protection from significant unfavorable losses resulting from damages to, or the loss of, physical assets or loss of human life or liability claims of third parties, attributed to certain assets and including such occurrences as well blowouts and resulting oil spills. We regularly review our risks of loss and the cost and availability of insurance and consider the need to revise our insurance program accordingly. Our insurance coverage includes deductibles which must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.
 
In general, our current insurance policies covering a blowout or other insurable incident resulting in damage to one of our oil and gas wells provide up to $20 million of well control, pollution cleanup and consequential damages coverage and $11 million of third party liability coverage for additional pollution cleanup and consequential damages, which also covers personal injury and death.
 
If a well blowout, spill or similar event occurs that is not covered by insurance or not fully protected by insured limits, we would be responsible for the costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
Marketing, Major Customers and Delivery Commitments
 
Markets for oil and natural gas are volatile and are subject to wide fluctuations depending on numerous factors beyond our control, including seasonality, economic conditions, foreign imports, political conditions in other energy producing countries, OPEC market actions, and domestic government regulations and policies. Substantially all of our production is sold pursuant to agreements with pricing based on prevailing commodity prices, subject to adjustment for regional differentials and similar factors. These contracts are generally set up on a month to month basis and can be cancelled at any time by either party giving 30 days notice. We had no material delivery commitments as of October 12, 2018.
Regulatory Environment
 
Our oil and gas exploration, production, and related operations are subject to numerous and frequently changing federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These regulations relate to, among other things, environmental and land-use matters, conservation, safety, pipeline use, drilling and spacing of wells, well stimulation, transportation, and forced pooling and protection of correlative rights among interest owners. Environmental laws and regulations may require the acquisition of certain permits prior to or in connection with our activities and operations. In addition, they may restrict or prohibit the types, quantities, and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment, including releases from drilling and production operations, and restrict or prohibit drilling or other operations that could impact wetlands, endangered or threatened species or other protected areas or natural resources. Following is a summary of some key statutory and regulatory programs that affect our operations.
 
Regulation of Oil and Gas
 
Certain regulations may govern the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the rates of production or “allowables,” the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, and the notification of surface owners and other third parties. Certain laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. We also are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to Native American tribal surface ownership, Native American oil and gas leases and other exploration agreements, fees, taxes, or other burdens, obligations, and issues unique to oil and gas ownership and operations within Native American reservations.

Environmental and Land Use Regulation
 
A wide variety of environmental and land-use regulations apply to companies engaged in the production and sale of oil and natural gas. These regulations have been changed frequently in the past and, in general, these changes have imposed more stringent requirements that increase operating costs and/or require capital expenditures to remain in compliance. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and/or criminal penalties and liability for non-compliance, clean-up costs and other environmental and natural resource damages. It also is possible that unanticipated developments or changes in the law could require us to make environmental expenditures significantly greater than those we currently expect.
Discharges to Waters. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended (the “Clean Water Act”), and comparable state statutes impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of “pollutants,” which include dredge and fill material, produced waters, various oil and natural gas wastes, including drilling fluids, drill cuttings, and other substances. Discharge of such pollutants into wetlands, onshore (streams, rivers, etc.), coastal and offshore waters without appropriate permits is prohibited. These controls generally have become more stringent over time, and it is possible that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future. Violation of the Clean Water Act and similar state regulatory programs can result in civil, criminal and administrative penalties for the unauthorized discharges of pollutants. Violations also put operators at risk of citizen lawsuits under the Clean Water Act, seeking both enforcement of the Clean Water Act’s provisions and civil penalties and litigation costs. Operators may also face substantial liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with improper discharges of pollutants.
 
The Clean Water Act also regulates stormwater discharges from industrial properties and construction sites, and requires permits and the implementation of site-specific Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans (“SWPPPs”), best management practices, training, and periodic monitoring of covered activities. Certain operations also are required to develop and implement Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (“SPCC”) plans, and in some circumstances, facility response plans to address potential oil and produced water spills. Certain exemptions from some Clean Water Act requirements were created or broadened pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
 
The Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”) of 1990 places strict liability for oil spills on the "responsible party," which it defines for onshore facilities as the owner or operator of a facility or pipeline. Strict liability means liability without fault. The OPA provides for the recovery of cleanup and removal costs, and also recognizes as recoverable damages the loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity due to the injury to natural resources caused by an oil spill. Further, a federal, state, foreign government, or Indian tribe trustee may recover damages for injury to natural resources, including the reasonable cost of assessing the damage. Finally, federal and state governments may also recover damages for the loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees, or profits brought about by injury to property or natural resources. We may be subject to strict liability under OPA for all or part of the costs of cleaning up oil spills from our facilities and for natural resource damages. We have not, to our knowledge, been identified as a responsible party under OPA, nor are we aware of any prior owners or operators of our properties that have been so identified with respect to their operation of those properties.
 
Safe Drinking Water Act – Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or the “SDWA”, is the main federal law that authorizes the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to set standards for drinking water quality and oversee the states, localities, and water suppliers who implement those standards. The Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program under the SDWA is responsible for regulating the construction, operation, permitting, and closure of injection wells that place fluids underground. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 currently excludes hydraulic fracturing from regulation by the SDWA. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that creates a fracture extending from a well bore into a low-permeability rock formation to enable oil or natural gas to move more easily to a production well. Hydraulic fractures typically are created through the injection of water, sand and chemicals into the rock formation.
 
The United States Congress has on multiple occasions considered, and may in the future consider, legislation such as the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, or the FRAC Act, to amend the SDWA to repeal this exemption. However, Congress has not taken any significant action on such legislation. A version of the FRAC Act was introduced in 2017 but remains in the first stages of the legislative process. If enacted as currently proposed, the FRAC Act would amend the definition of “underground injection” in the SDWA to encompass hydraulic fracturing activities. Such a provision could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, including disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. The FRAC Act’s proposal to require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. It is not possible to predict whether a future session of Congress may act further on hydraulic fracturing legislation. Such legislation, if adopted, could establish additional regulation and permitting requirements at the federal level.

In addition, in March 2010, at the request of the U.S. Congress, EPA announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water resources. A progress report was released in December 2012. In May 2014, the EPA indicated that as a first step, it would convene a stakeholder process to develop an approach to obtain information on chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. To gather information to inform EPA's proposal, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) and initiated a public participation process to seek comment on the information that should be reported or disclosed for hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures and the mechanism for obtaining this information. EPA issued a draft report in June 2015, concluding that, although hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources through water withdrawals, spills, fracturing directly into such resources, underground migration of liquids and gases, and inadequate treatment and discharge of wastewater, EPA did not find evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States. EPA finalized the report in December 2016, after considering public comments on the draft report. The key findings remain largely unchanged from the draft report, although EPA noted in the final report that data gaps and uncertainties limited EPA’s ability to fully assess the potential impacts on drinking water resources locally and nationally.
 
Hydraulic fracturing currently is regulated primarily at the state level. Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Texas, and New Mexico recently enacted rules to regulate certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These regulations generally require companies to disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations, as well as the concentrations of those chemicals, on a well-by-well basis, either prior to or following well completion, depending on which state’s regulations apply.
 
Air Emissions.  Our operations are subject to local, state and federal regulations governing emissions of air pollutants. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally based permitting requirements. Producing wells, natural gas plants and electric generating facilities all emit volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and nitrous oxides in their normal operation.  Civil and administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits generally are resolved by payment of monetary fines, performance of mitigation projects to offset excess emissions and the correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could require us to forego construction, modification or operation of certain sources of emissions.
 
In April 2012, EPA issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that among other things, requires operators to capture 95 percent of the volatile organic compounds (“VOC”) emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. The reduction in VOC emissions is accomplished primarily through the use of “reduced emissions completion” methods to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air or be combusted. EPA also issued regulations that set requirements for VOC emissions from several types of equipment, including storage tanks, compressors, dehydrators, valves and connectors. In June 2016, EPA issued additional regulations specific to the oil and gas industry adding methane standards for equipment and processes covered by the 2012 regulations.  The 2016 final regulations also add leak detection and repair (LDAR) requirements for equipment such as valves, connectors, pressure relief valves, open-ended lines, access doors, flanges, crank case vents, pump seals or diaphragms, closed vent systems, compressors, separators, dehydrators, thief hatches on storage tanks, and sweetening units at gas processing plants. On April 19, 2017, EPA announced its intent to administratively reconsider the methane rules, staying a June 3, 2017 effective date for certain provisions—such as the LDAR provisions—for 90 days. Environmental groups filed a petition to stop the administrative stay in the D.C. Circuit, and on July 3, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted relief for the petitioners, which had the impact of making the previously-stayed rules effective. And on September 12, 2018, EPA proposed revisions to its 2016 methane regulations and sought comment on additional areas for possible revision as part of its previously noted reconsideration of those rules. While EPA continues to reconsider aspects of the methane rule, it will remain effective.  These new and revised regulations, or the adoption of any other laws or regulations restricting or reducing these emissions, will increase our operating costs.
 
Another regulatory development that may impact our operations is EPA’s notice of finding and determination that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to human health and the environment.  In response to that finding, EPA has implemented GHG-related reporting, monitoring, and recordkeeping rules for petroleum and natural gas systems, among other industries, and developed a Climate Action Plan, including a Methane Strategy which formed the basis for methane regulations issued in June 2016. However, the Executive Office report calling for the Climate Action Plan and Methane Strategy was rescinded by President Trump by Executive Order 13,783, and the June 2016 methane regulations, though currently effective, are the subject of proposed and possible further reconsideration and revision, as noted above. EPA has also solicited comment on a proposed two-year stay of those methane rules. Those methane regulations remain in effect until possible revision or repeal by separate EPA rulemaking in the future, which action is also likely to be challenged in the courts. While the U.S. Congress has considered, and may in the future again consider, “cap and trade” legislation that would establish an economy-wide cap on emissions of GHGs in the United States and could require major sources of GHG emissions to obtain GHG emission “allowances” to continue their operations, the current administration’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate accords, announced on June 1, 2017, among other factors, makes passage of such legislation less likely in the near term. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs would be likely to increase our operating costs and could also have an adverse effect on demand for our production.

Waste Disposal. We currently own or lease a number of properties that have been used for production of oil and natural gas for many years. Although we believe the prior owners and/or operators of those properties generally utilized operating and disposal practices that met applicable standards in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties we currently own or lease. State and federal laws applicable to oil and natural gas wastes have become more stringent over time. Under new and existing laws, we could be required to remediate property, including groundwater, containing or impacted by previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or to perform remedial well-plugging operations to prevent future, or mitigate existing, contamination.
 
We may generate wastes, including “solid” wastes and “hazardous” wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, although certain oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) wastes currently are excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. On May 4, 2016, several environmental groups filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court for the District of Columbia seeking to compel the EPA to review the exemption of E&P wastes under RCRA. The groups had previously filed a Notice of Intent to Sue (“NOI”) EPA in August 2015 for failure to act on a 2010 petition to review the E&P RCRA exemption. In late December 2016, EPA entered into a consent decree with the environmental groups and agreed to reconsider the Agency’s current treatment of E&P wastes. The District Court approved the consent decree, binding EPA to a court-imposed timeline for determining how oil and gas wastes should be regulated under RCRA. EPA has until March 2019 to make its determination. If E&P waste becomes regulated as hazardous waste, then generators, transporters, and owners/operators of disposal and treatment facilities will be subject to RCRA regulations at significant increased cost. Thus, it is possible that certain wastes generated by our oil and natural gas operations that currently are excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes, and may therefore become subject to more rigorous and costly management, disposal and clean-up requirements. State and federal oil and natural gas regulations also provide guidelines for the storage and disposal of solid wastes resulting from the production of oil and natural gas, both onshore and offshore.
 
Superfund. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and similar state laws, responsibility for the entire cost of cleaning up a contaminated site, as well as natural resource damages, can be imposed upon current or former site owners or operators and any party who releases or threatens to release one or more designated “hazardous substances” at the site, regardless of whether the original activities that led to the contamination were lawful at the time of disposal. This is known as strict liability, meaning liability without fault. CERCLA also authorizes EPA and, in some cases, third parties, to take actions in response to releases of hazardous substances into the environment and to seek to recover from the potentially responsible parties the costs of such response actions. Although CERCLA generally excludes petroleum from the definition of hazardous substances, in the course of our operations we may have generated and may generate other wastes that fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. We also may be an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been released by previous owners or operators. We may be subject to joint and several liability as well as strict liability under CERCLA for all or part of the costs of cleaning up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages. Joint and several liability is liability that may be apportioned either among two or more parties or to only one or a few select members of a group, making each party individually responsible for the entire obligation. In some situations we could be exposed to liability for clean-up costs and other damages as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of third parties at, or prior operators of, properties we have acquired. This includes, in some circumstances, operators of properties in which we have an interest and parties that provide transportation services for us. If exposed to joint and several liability, we could be responsible for more than our share of costs for remediating a particular site, and potentially for the entire obligation, even where other parties were involved in the activity giving rise to the liability. We have not, to our knowledge, been identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA, nor are we aware of any prior owners or operators of our properties that have been so identified with respect to their ownership or operation of those properties.
BLM Venting and Flaring Proposed Rule. On January 22, 2016 the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) released a proposed BLM Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation proposed rule. Comment on the proposed rule closed on April 22, 2016, and BLM issued its final rule on November 18, 2016. Petitions for judicial review of the rule were filed by industry groups and, as a result, BLM postponed compliance dates for certain sections of the rule pending judicial review. The 2016 rule was designed to replace the BLM's notice to lessees, NTL-4A, on venting and flaring at oil and gas facilities producing on federal and tribal lands by dealing with provisions related to venting and flaring of oil and natural gas, leak detection, storage tanks, pneumatic controllers and pumps, well maintenance and unloading, drilling and completions, and royalties. On September 18, 2018, however, the BLM substantially revised its 2016 Waste Prevention Rule, which had also been the subject of multiple court challenges but had become effective at certain points in the interim due to various court rulings. The 2018 rule essentially reverts the agency’s regulation of venting and flaring to what existed before the 2016 Waste Prevention Rule was promulgated.

Potentially Material Costs Associated with Environmental Regulation of Our Oil and Natural Gas Operations
 
Significant potential costs relating to environmental and land-use regulations associated with our existing properties and operations include those relating to: (i) plugging and abandonment of facilities; (ii) clean-up costs and damages due to spills or other releases; and (iii) penalties imposed for spills, releases or non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we typically have contractually assumed, and may assume in the future, obligations relating to plugging and abandonment, clean-up and other environmental costs in connection with our acquisition of operating interests in fields, and these costs can be significant.
Plugging and Abandonment Costs
 
Our operations are subject to stringent abandonment and closure requirements imposed by the various regulatory bodies including the BLM and state agencies.
 
As described in Note 5 to our financial statements, we have estimated the present value of our aggregate asset retirement obligations to be $3.4 million as of June 30, 2018. This figure reflects the expected future costs associated with site reclamation, facilities dismantlement and plugging and abandonment of wells. The discount rates used to calculate the present value varied depending on the estimated timing of the obligation, but typically ranged between 4% and 13 %. Actual costs may differ from our estimates. Our financial statements do not reflect any liabilities relating to other environmental obligations. Following the sale of the Foreman Butte project this balance will be reduced by $2.5 million to reflect the abandonment liability transferred to the buyer of the property.
Competition
 
The oil and natural gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of additional reserves and in the sale of oil and natural gas. Our competitors consist of major and intermediate sized integrated oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators. The principal competitive factors in the acquisition of undeveloped oil and gas leases include the availability and quality of staff and data necessary to identify, investigate and purchase such leases, and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such leases. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, and more fully developed staffs and facilities than ours. In addition, the producing, processing and marketing of natural gas and crude oil are affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, the effect of which cannot be accurately predicted. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Ultimately, our future success will depend on our ability to develop or acquire additional reserves at costs that allow us to remain competitive.
Employees
 
At October 12, 2018, we had 4 employees in Denver, Colorado, U.S. We also have 2 part time employees and 1 full time employee located in Perth, Western Australia that are involved in facilitating the administration of the Company. 
Available Information
