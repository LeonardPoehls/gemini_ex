Business of PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Summary
 
We have developed and are launching a new generation of high potency veterinary cancer medications and nutraceuticals.
 
PetLife’s main product, Vitalzul™ inhibits blood vessels formation in solid tumors. Chlorotoxin blocks trans-membrane fluxes of chlorine and regulates the adjusting of cell growth, cell division, metastasis and induces apoptosis (dose dependent) that leads to tumor cells death. The regulating of activity of the potassium (K+) 3-4 kDa, sodium (N+) 6-8 kDa and chloride (CL+) voltgate ionic channels of the tumor cells leads to growth arrest and causes cell death (apoptosis); additionally, calcium dependent potassium channels inhibit growth of other cancer cells.
 
The National Cancer Institute reported that in the United States alone, nearly 6 million dogs and 6.5 million cats are diagnosed with cancer annually with dogs being 35 times and cats 40 times more likely to suffer from cancer than humans. Sixty percent of dogs and cats over six years of age will be diagnosed with cancer.

In the United States over 92 million households own a dog or cat, representing 83.3 million dogs and 95.6 million cats. Consumer spending on domestic companion animals in the United States alone is expected to reach over $60.28 billion in 2015, with over $13 billion being spent on over the counter medications. Demand for domestic pet health products is expected to grow approximately 4 - 6% annually through 2018
 
PetLife plans to apply to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018 to begin a New Animal Drug Application for prescription strength version of VitalzulTM. Although there can be no assurance the FDA will work this quickly, the Company anticipates FDA approval of its prescription strength products in the second half of 2019, and intends to roll out those products shortly thereafter.
 
The Company has a developed a sophisticated, multi-channel marketing strategy, to be implemented in the second half of 2017, that includes direct sales, retail, veterinarian vertical market, affiliate sales and infomercials for its nutraceutical formulation.
 
As part of our mission to bring health and well-being to our companion animals, PetLife has acquired “Healthy Life Pets “a natural based pet food company founded by renowned veterinarian, Dr. Geoffrey Broderick. The Company plans to market a new brand “Dr. Geoff’s by PetLife” as a premium product and will seek to provide evidence of the benefit of the food on cancer prevention and general pet health.
 
Corporate Overview
 
PetLife Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a registered U.S. Veterinary Pharmaceutical company whose mission is to bring its scientifically proven, potentiated bioactive medication and nutraceuticals — “Vitalzul™” — to the world of veterinary oncology. The Company specializes in the research, development, sales and support of advanced drugs and nutraceuticals for pet cancer and autoimmune related diseases such as arthritis.
 
Since the histology (cellular biology) of human, dogs and cats is quite similar at the molecular level, it is notable that PetLife, upon the completion of our veterinary trials, PetLife can continue to develop Vitalzul™, for human use or out license the technology as deemed appropriate by management and our medical team.
 
Business Strategy
 

● | Initially, enter the market with an oral nutraceutical version of Vitalzul™ with a focus on the oncology needs of dogs and cats. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Raise capital through traditional means, including through this private placement of securities, additional private placements, public offerings and/or bank financings. 
● | Apply for FDA approval of the Caribbean Blue Scorpion animal pharmaceutical drug, VitalzulTM for cancer treatment, a prescription strength oral pharmaceutical as well as a concentrated intravenous and injectable version for direct administration to a tumor. 
● | Concurrently develop edible dog and cat treats that are infused with Vitalzul™’s active ingredients that deliver preventative benefits for both dogs and cats. 

FDA Process, Cost and Time Line
 
The Company plan outlines the necessary studies and regulatory actions required to move Vitalzul TM thought the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) approval process.
 
The lead for our FDA approval of the pharmaceutical version of VitalzulTM is Dr. Vivek Ramana, our Chief Medical Officer, who has greater than 20 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry and has worked on more than 25 drugs that have been approved by the FDA. Dr. Ramana has more than four years’ experience working with Scorpion venom and has successfully secured approval of a scorpion-based Chlorotoxin Oncology drug for humans in India. His combined professional experience and personal knowledge of Vitalzul™ gives PetLife great confidence in his ability to manage the process, adhere to the timelines and maintain the project budget.
 
Dr. Ramana has provided PetLife with a time line of approximately 24 months to successfully complete the required clinical studies and register the pharmaceutical version of Vitalzul TM with the FDA/CVM. We will also push to fast track the drug and can potentially have it approved as a compassionate use drug for pets in as little as nine months.
 
Prior to our discussions with the FDA, the Company, under the direction of Dr. Ramana, has completed a preliminary dosing and toxicology study. The third study required prior to our FDA discussion is a cell line study, which should be completed within the next several months.
 
During the initial stage of our proposed FDA trial, the drug will be analyzed to establish its structure, stability and toxicity. This stage will establish the ability to produce a stable, replicable drug product supply for the subsequent clinical studies in animals. This stage is estimated to take 3-9 months to complete at a cost of approximately $700,000.
 
The second stage is pre-clinical development. In this stage, InnoVision Therapeutics will perform the studies necessary to establish the safety of the product. These studies include toxicology and dosing studies as well as establish the pharmokinetics and pharmodynamics of the drug. Essentially, we want to learn what the drug does to the body and what the body does to the drug. This stage is estimated to take between 9 and 24 months. Many of these studies can be performed during the initial stage of the project if funding is available. The estimated cost of this stage is approximately $2,200,000.
 
In the third stage will include standard FDA phase I, II and III studies on dogs. These studies will establish safety and efficacy of the drug in a canine model and allow for the determination of appropriate dosing. Some of these studies can be run concurrently with earlier stages. The estimated to take between 12-24 months at accost of $3,600,000.

-

 

Based on the information provided in our Development Plan, assuming immediate full funding allowing concurrent studies, we expect to complete our FDA submission within 24 months.
 
The FDA/CVM registration is only necessary for the pharmaceutical version products PetLife wishes to sell globally. The nutraceutical version, pet food, treats and other products do require FDA/CVM approval under the Nutraceutical Division. Having this stamp of approval and completing these necessary tests will allow PetLife to make the necessary claims on the product label and in its advertising programs. This will move PetLife from a company with lots of anecdotal evidence and a few clinical trials to one with certified studies and evidence meeting all the necessary requirements by the FDA/CVM.
 
The Company’s Vitalzul TM Product
 
PetLife will initially develop dedicated cancer preventative products, such as animal treats. These products are designed to prolong pets’ lives when taken consistently. The Company anticipates this will drive sales for PetLife as clients adopt these types of products as part of their pet’s normal daily diets. Part of PetLife’s sales and marketing framework is to not only sell the products to animal’s post cancer diagnosis, but to educate owners on cancer and autoimmune prevention. PetLife’s preventative animal treats, for example, are an excellent way for pet owners to promote lasting health and viability for their companions.
 
PetLife anticipates developing the following products for the cancer preventative products:
 

● | Vitalzul™ Preventative – a natural pet treat preventative 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------
● | Vitalzul™ Tabs – a natural daily pet preventative tablet 
● | Vitalzul™ Pet Foods – natural preventative foods 

 
VitalzulTM has demonstrated an effect on several different cancer types. With inexpensive modifications, PetLife may be able to create cancer specific products that may increase sales. The following are the top veterinary cancer types that PetLife intends to target:
 

● | Lymphoma or Lymph sarcoma 
--+----------------------------------------
● | Hemangiosarcoma 
● | Osteosarcoma 
● | Mast Cell Tumor 
● | Melanoma 
● | Squamous Cell Carcinoma 
● | Mammary Carcinoma 
● | Apocrine Gland Carcinoma (Anal Sac) 
● | Transitional Cell Carcinoma 
● | Soft Tissue Sarcoma 
● | Lymphoma 
● | Squamous carcinoma 
● | Fibrosarcoma 
● | Lung tumors 
● | Brain tumors 
● | Nasal tumors 
● | Liver tumors 

 
PetLife plans to design three products for differentiated intake protocols for home and veterinary usage.
 

● | Oral / Rectal - Home oral and rectal administration of the VitalzulTM liquid makes the animal easy to treat. The solution is colorless and odorless and can be administered through a droplet or enema. This is an effective tool which clients can use in the convenience of their home. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-


● | Injectable/Intravenous - The injectable/intravenous version can be used by veterinarians to directly inject the product into the tumor for effective, targeted high dose treatments. This will increase sales with vets who will have an effective in clinic, targeted product will require clients to bring their pets into the vet clinic for treatment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
PetLife, through the work of its analytical scientists, has identified a diversity of diseases that it believes will respond positively from treatments with the Vitalzul™ nutraceuticals and drugs. The diseases below illustrate those areas of potential expansion beyond the current focus on veterinary oncology related illnesses. The expansion of the application of PetLife’s products and technical knowledge into other health related areas will require the addition of skilled research scientists and pharmacological experts. PetLife will expand its market reach and increase its revenue by treating other diseases.
 
PetLife intends to also develop products for pets in the following areas:
 

● | Arthritis: Arthritis (or osteoarthritis) is a slowly progressive, degenerative disease of the joints for which there is no cure. However, Vitalzul TM may be able to help to prevent, delay, and manage arthritis in dogs or cats. Arthritis affects 1 in 5 dogs over the age of 7 and over 90% of geriatric cats have arthritis; currently 12 million cats have arthritis. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Hepatitis: As with humans, Hepatitis in dogs and cats affects the liver. This contagious disease includes symptoms such as fever, vomiting and diarrhea accompanied by abdominal pain. Furthermore, Hepatitis may lead to kidney damage. Approximately, 12% of dogs and 40% of cats get Hepatitis. 


● | Lyme disease: Lyme disease is a dangerous bacterial disease that can cause irreversible damage to a companion animal’s health. About 5% of dogs contract Lyme disease while the statistics for cats is nominal. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Global Market for Vitalzul TM and the Company’s Products
 
The global veterinary pharmaceutical industry is composed of various veterinary health products including biological, veterinary pharmaceuticals and medicated food additives. Over the past few years, the range of animal health products has diversified, currently encompassing metabolic drugs, reproductive aids, anti-infectives, feed additives, imaging diagnostics, vaccines, parasite control, and topical solutions. Veterinary products have emerged for treating chronic diseases such as cancer, osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease. Pet owners, more than ever before, are spending a larger proportion of their income to take care of their pets’ health.
 
In the future, the global market for pet health products is expected to grow by an average of 4 - 6% annually and become more specialized. The major drivers will be: (1) the continued strengthening of the bond between owners and their animal companions, (2) increasing companion animal owner awareness and willingness to pay for care, (3) increasing occurrence of cancer in dogs and cats than people while only a fraction are treated because of prohibitive costs, (4) offering an FDA drug at competitive prices, and potentially more effective, as an incentive for more pet owners to treat their pets and extend their duration and quality of life. Companion animals have come to play an important part in the lives of many people. Unsurprisingly the bond between companion animals and people continues to strengthen in parallel to the market for products that contribute significantly to the health and well-being of these animals, such as the products offered by PetLife.
 
The current focus of the Company’s market is veterinary oncology, a branch of veterinary medicine whose emphasis is dealing with cancer diagnosis and treatment in animals, especially companion animals. Over the years, the number of animals dying of cancer has increased. For example, approximately 45% of dogs aged ten years and above die of cancer. Part of PetLife’s product expansion will include an injectable version that will focus on decreasing and eliminating tumors that are accessible to direct injection
 
PetLife realizes the parallels between animals and their owners regarding certain conditions, such as poor diet, and its consequences. Overall, the companion animal segment is considered to be the health segment that parallels the human pharmaceutical sector. Many of the innovations in human medicine, at least in terms of new medications, are subsequently adapted and tailored to suit companion animals, like Vitalzul™.
 
The global animal health market is consolidated with the top ten players controlling the majority share of the market. For many years the largest players in the companion animal market have been Merial and Zoetis. However, the market has seen considerable consolidation mainly through acquisitions and mergers. Proposed mergers and acquisitions are monitored very carefully by governments around the world (such as the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs in the European Union and the United States Federal Trade Commission) to protect the consumer from reduced competition, price increases, and reduced innovation.
 
Medication and treatments for veterinary cancer are limited and largely ineffective - mainly aimed at temporarily delaying disease progression rather than effective treatments. The veterinary health market for companion animals has grown slowly but steadily by 4% - 6% annually while companion animal expenditures has grown to more than 6.9% compound annual growth rate.
 
While the U.S. represents the biggest regional market for animal medication, Asia-Pacific region represents the fastest growing market for pet medication with annual dollar sales in the region growing at an annual average of 10.5%. This can be attributed to factors such as increasing income, improvement in per capita consumption per animal, improved living standards, as well as increased pet populations in various regions all over the world. About half of Brazilian households have a dog, more than any other country, according to data tracker Euromonitor, and pet food sales there rose 10 percent to $5.6 billion last year, trailing only the U.S. and U.K. in the $71 billion worldwide market.

Despite remaining challenges in the overall economy, the pet industry has remained unshaken and has been less affected by the recent global recession than other retail sectors. Over the past years, the United States and the United Kingdom have been the leaders in the pet industry. However, today there are a number of other countries that are coming out as players in the global pet industry. The trend in world pet industry has increased tremendously, which is a clear indication of the growing market for veterinary oncology services.
 
Market in the United States
 
The veterinary oncology market in the United States is expected to grow mainly due to an increase in the pet population in the United States. People’s attitude towards companion animals has changed, as most pet owners now treat their pets as family members. In a report by Global Industry Analysts, Animal Medication: A Global Strategic Business Report, the authors indicate that animal care often mirrors the trends in human health care. Diagnosis and disease monitoring in veterinary medicine, particularly for companion animals, has also followed trends in human medicine. Diagnostic imaging techniques, such as ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have become commonplace and many veterinary practices have in-house analyzers for clinical chemistry and hematology, as well as rapid patient-side tests, e.g., for infectious agents.
 

The National Cancer Institute reported that nearly six million dogs in the United States alone are diagnosed with cancer annually, with dogs being 35 times more likely to suffer from cancer than humans. Over six years of age, sixty percent of America’s 83.3 million dogs and 95.6 million cats will be diagnosed with cancer. Unfortunately, only an estimated 10% of those diagnosed receive treatment. PetLife understands that 90% of dogs and cats with cancer go untreated because of unrealistically high costs associated with treatments as well as the dramatic suffering typical of treating pets with toxic, conventional chemotherapy
 
Marketing Plan
 
PetLife will deliver its nutraceutical and prescription strength medicines to the enormous population of untreated animals by making the product affordable and convenient in both the home and veterinary setting. PetLife will also capitalize on the increased willingness of pet owners to spend more on their animals’ preventative health, and of veterinarians to meet that demand as key drivers of this market. PetLife will also dedicate their marketing efforts to include educating the public as to the risk their companion animal has at developing cancer. The Company will emphasize the importance on pet owners being proactive and taking the necessary steps to protect their animal. The Company will offer VitalzulTM as the preventative solution.
 
Currently, apart from surgery which carries its own risks for older pets, the preponderance of treatment for dogs and cats with cancer is simply the same, drastically expensive (most pets do not have medical insurance), toxic chemotherapy drugs developed for humans — scaled down in dosage by the pet’s weight — with many of the same side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, lost appetite, cachexia (“wasting” loss of muscle and fat tissues) headache, hair loss, liver and kidney toxicity and susceptibility to opportune infections.
 
Direct Sales
 
PetLife has lined up key team members to execute a traditional, multichannel marketing campaign. This campaign, composed of the traditional five “P” marketing mix will include:

● | Product – PetLife will capitalize on the proprietary nature of their primary product offering, Vitalzul™. PetLife will sell Vitalzul™ to veterinarians using multiple respected veterinarian centers of influence to promote the product. PetLife will also sell directly to pet owners through online and brick and mortar establishments; this will be achieved using a well-connected sales force to market to both distributors and direct to retail outlets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Physical attributes – a newly redesigned bottle has been approved. 
● | Place or distribution – the Company will configure its corporate structure to accommodate the most efficient global supply chain, production and distribution through regional sales centers. PetLife representatives will manage the supply chain, local final production (as required) and distribution.

-


● | Promotion – direct to vet, direct to consumer, direct to wholesaler; there will also be trade shows, direct vet outreach and online webinars. PetLife will also implement an aggressive online marketing campaign to drive sales in the United States and key international markets using: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(i) | DOSEP Campaign: DOSEP (Direct Organic Search Engine Optimization) is a groundbreaking online awareness campaign and technology that will push PetLife’s web presence to the top of Google organic search results for targeted search keywords determined by PetLife management. 
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | Multi-Touch Facebook Campaign: The retained Marketing Company will execute a targeted multi-touch Facebook advertising campaign that will generate major social awareness (and resulting online sales) of Vet Oncology products. The marketing messages will appear directly in the Facebook newsfeeds of specific demographic groups who additionally have expressed personal or professional interest in cancer treatment, based on research and targeting of the specific interests contained in their Facebook profiles. 
(iii) | Scientifically-Optimized Banner Ad Campaign: The Marketing Company will conduct research for optimal placement, and perform continuous split testing of ads to quickly determine “winners” and then further refine campaigns to determine the optimal combination of performance metrics to justify increasing ad budget spend for top-performing banner campaigns. 


● | Media – the Company will engage a top-notch boutique public relations firm to generate media coverage for its products in general news, family, pet and veterinarian publications, e-zines, videos and the blogosphere to communicate Vitalzul™ features and benefits to consumers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The online strategic marketing campaigns will repeatedly “local-launch” PetLife into specific metro markets while concurrently building PetLife’s overall brand and marketing presence globally. Repeating the online marketing campaign in each additional targeted metro market will not only localize and establish the PetLife’s brand and products, each event will also increase PetLife’s local and nationwide Google search rankings via DOSEP, Multi-Touch Facebook and Scientifically-Optimized Banner Ads, producing both short- and long-term online sales growth, and firmly establish PetLife as a market leader.
 
Direct Response: Infomercials
 
This year an estimated $150 billion dollars in product sales will be generated by infomercials. Specifically, over $1.5 billion will be spent on pet-related purchases through infomercials. Research has shown that retail sales driven by infomercials all range from two to 15 times the infomercial sales. More and more major brands are integrating infomercials into their marketing mix. Infomercials share the product story and benefits with millions of additional prospects at a cost per lead or cost per order that usually matches or beats other direct marketing channels such as direct mail or print ads.
 
PetLife anticipates the infomercial will:
 

● | Reach millions of new customers and present a complete product story. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enhance, support, and fill in where other advertising avenues, particularly spot television, leaves off. 
● | Generate qualified leads. 
● | Reduce advertising costs per order and avoid print and mailing costs. 
● | Rapidly and cost-effectively introduce a new product or revive an under-marketed but potentially profitable product. 

 
PetLife intends to capitalize on the lucrative channels of distribution available to an infomercial marketer. Only one out of every 100 consumers watching an infomercial actively calls an 800 number and purchases the product immediately. Therefore, the retail channel provides a means for the other 99 individuals - who may have been primed by the infomercial - to buy the product.
 
One-step infomercials are commonly utilized for products previously unable to get retail shelf space in order to gain retailers attention and establish instant distribution. For example, PetLife can inform a retailer that more than a million consumers ordered their product directly from their television ads and thousands of others called for more information. These kinds of figures are meant to grab the attention of brick and mortar retailers, who then purchase and showcase infomercial products realizing that “as seen on TV” are big sellers at retail.
 
Competition
 
For most of the products the Company offers there are a number of competitors, several of which are publicly-traded where they not only manufacture and produce their own products but also have established distribution and sales networks and participate in large group purchasing organizations within the medical industry. As mature companies, they also have extensive legacy systems and expensive administrative and sales commission cost structures. In addition, there are independent distributorships of pet medications primarily focused on limited geographic markets and products located across the United States.

In addition, it develops and licenses its branded veterinary product portfolio of novel and generic pharmaceuticals, and specialist pet diets. Preveceutical, Inc.: Preveceutical and partner, Uniquest, are currently screening peptides isolated from Caribbean Blue Scorpion venom across some of the most aggressive diseases where there exists unmet clinical need, such as cancer. 

 
In addition to drug companies, PetLife competes with animal supplements companies. That segment is fragmented, and is dominated by small firms. However, it is witnessing tremendous growth due to the following trends;
 
● Pet owners view supplements as natural ways to promote health and wellness
 
● Veterinarians have come to view supplements as reasonable alternatives to animal drugs and are more willing to recommend them as adjuvant or even replacement therapy
 
● Well formulated supplements with functional ingredients that target specific physiological—and psychological—needs of today’s pets are enticing a whole population of pet parents committed to optimizing the quality of their animals’ lives
 
● The marketing of recognizable label claims and ingredients found in human diets, such as chicken fillets or fresh salmon, glucosamine, omega 3 fatty acids, probiotics and antioxidants attract shoppers who want to provide the “best” for their pets.
 
Intellectual Property
 
PetLife has developed its own patent-pending formulation of Chlorotoxin (the primary active of Blue Scorpion venom) and other naturally occurring plant-based nutrients with known cancer fighting properties. Additionally, PetLife has acquired the formulations of Healthy Life Pets, which is the basis of our “Dr. Geoff’s by PetLife” food line.
Regulatory Issues
 
There are worldwide, national, state and local rules, regulations and statutes that may impact the Company’s ability to fully implement our strategic plan. The sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products. To maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes, systems and dedicated resources with involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market. In the majority of our markets, the relevant animal health authority is separate from those governing human medicinal products.

United States
 
The regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation of animal health pharmaceuticals in the United States is the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), housed within the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). All manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals must show their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Post-approval monitoring of products is required by law, with reports being provided to the CVM’s Surveillance and Compliance group. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are produced in accordance with the law. Additionally, we are required to submit all new information for a product, regardless of the source.
 
The regulatory body in the United States for veterinary vaccines is the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA’s Center for Veterinary Biologics is responsible for the regulation of animal health vaccines, including immunotherapeutics. All manufacturers of animal health biologicals must show their products to be pure, safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Virus Serum Toxin Act. Post-approval monitoring of products is required. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are produced in accordance with the agency requirements.
 
Outside of the United States
 
Country-specific regulatory laws have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling, safety, efficacy and manufacturers’ quality control procedures (to assure the consistency of the products), as well as company records and reports.
