ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

OVERVIEW
 
Findex.com, Inc. is headquartered in Lake Park, Florida with its base of business operations co-located in the same facility. The Company is currently comprised of EcoSmart and a consolidated variable interest entity, Advanced Cement Sciences, LLC (formerly Advanced Nanofibers, LLC). EcoSmart has historically been the driver of both operating overhead and revenue. EcoSmart was acquired by us in a merger in 2014 and centers around a proprietary line of specialty materials coatings that have a broad range of value-adding industrial, commercial, residential and consumer applications. Advanced Cement Sciences, LLC (“ACS”) is a variable interest entity. During the fourth quarter of 2016 management determined the Company was the primary beneficiary of ACS, and has since been consolidating those operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP for purposes of our financial reporting. The Company currently owns a minority 31.06% interest in ACS, which is a Florida-based, engineered cement technology and products firm founded in mid-2016 and currently focused on globally marketing a line of proprietary admixtures to be used in the production of ultra-lightweight, high-strength concrete and high-performance stucco. Despite our lack of corporate control over ACS, and its lack of revenue to date, it is a venture that our management has been and continues to be very actively involved in developing, and that is increasingly consuming a greater percentage of our financial and human resources, a trend management expects to continue into the foreseeable future.
ECOSMART
 
Our core business is centered around a line of specialty industrial glass-based “smart surface” coatings that have a wide range of uses across each of the industrial, commercial, and household market segments and that are centered around a U.S. patented technology that, either on its own or when coupled with any of an array of available proprietary formula additives, offers a unique combination of beneficial surface properties that allow for a broad array of multi-surface and end-product applications. Among others, such applications include:

▪ | Heavy Construction Equipment/Vehicles 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Oil and Gas Drilling and Related Heavy Equipment 
▪ | Industrial and Residential HVAC Equipment, Commercial Refrigeration Systems, and Power Generators
▪ | Interior and Exterior Flooring and Tiling, Pavers and Hardscapes 

 
Over time, EcoSmart intends to develop itself in the strategic direction of becoming a leading research-oriented high-tech specialty “smart-surface” materials development and licensing company centered around a highly-qualified research team and state-of-the-art research lab and applying a combination of organic and inorganic chemistries, materials science engineering, and nanotechnology. EcoSmart currently has expertise and capabilities in each of these areas.
 
Products
 
Broadly viewed, the surface is an integral aspect of virtually every physical object and often plays a fundamental role in many of the processes, beyond mere connectivity and structural support, that govern chemical and biological interactions involving the product. In some instances, the surface serves to protect the internal elements of the object that it surrounds; in others, it provides an entry point into those chemical or biological systems. In most, combinations of these attributes are present, and the potential variations are both vast in number and complex in structure.
 
Our specialty coatings business produces, markets, and distributes a line of effectively invisible glass-based specialty coatings – “smart surfaces” – that have a wide range of industrial, commercial, and household applications that add a competitive advantage to a given product or surface through a variety of protective and other features. Conventional coatings, which are bonded by mechanical means to whatever surface they are applied to, tend to fail, ultimately, in the bonding to the substrate, typically due to poor surface preparation or variation of temperature exposures. Uniquely, EcoSmart’s products consist of inorganic and organic combinatorial chemistry that causes them to bond chemically with the substrate, whether metal, cement-based, or organic (e.g. plastics). By utilizing covalent bonding that penetrates into the substrate and reacts directly with the free ion within, the otherwise resulting disbondment is avoided. The result is a much longer lasting and stronger coating, and, in turn, a longer life for the substrate that has been treated.
 
With an addition of only 50 millionths to 2 thousandths of an inch in surface thickness (depending on which product is used), no loss of either hardness, on the one hand, or pliability, on the other, and no reduction in photon (light) penetration, the patented platform technology, either on its own or when coupled with any of an array of available proprietary formula additives, offers the following unique combination of beneficial protective, maintenance-reducing, performance-enhancing and cosmetically-enhancing properties to most surfaces, including metals, plastics, paints, fabrics, vinyl, wood, masonry, or concrete, in each case without regard to temperature, climate or most other environmental conditions, without hazard to either human, animal or plant health/life, and for a period of up to as many as approximately 15-20 years:

Applications and Markets
 
With the extraordinary array of beneficial properties identified above, certain but not all of which have been independently lab-tested and verified, the range of potential applications of our specialty coatings is notably far-reaching, spanning across numerous industrial, commercial, and household segments. While we are currently focusing our pursuit on only several of these potential applications, and there can be no assurance that we will ever pursue any one or more of the others, we have identified the following as potential markets, among others, to be explored and possibly pursued over time:

▪ | Heavy Construction Equipment/Vehicles 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Oil and Gas Drilling and Related Heavy Equipment 
▪ | Marine Vessels and Fixtures/Infrastructure 
▪ | Industrial and Residential HVAC Equipment, Commercial Refrigeration Systems and Power Generators
▪ | Interior and Exterior Flooring and Tiling, Pavers and Hardscapes 
▪ | Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Building/Construction 
▪ | Sewage and Highway Infrastructure, Bridges

Heavy Construction Equipment/Vehicles. This is the market segment application involving foundational heavy terrain construction equipment fleets and individual units. It comprises a wide range of vehicles in the heavy construction industry, including gators, bulldozers, excavators, dump trucks, cement mixers, and other, similar types of equipment in relation to which our coatings offer strong prevention against rust, oxidation, corrosion and abrasion breakdown. We believe that our coatings could result in notably significant savings in maintenance costs as well as extended life for these types of equipment/vehicles used in these highly corrosive environments. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oil and Gas Drilling, Mining and Related Heavy Equipment. This is the market segment application surrounding a vast array of opportunities to sell certain of our coatings to prevent rust, oxidation, corrosion and abrasion breakdown in the oil, gas and mining industries. We believe that our coatings could result in notably significant savings in maintenance costs as well as extended life for equipment, tools, and infrastructure used in these highly corrosive environments. In this market segment, our coatings can be used as protective pipe linings and as protective barrier on the exteriors of storage tanks, micro-turbines, hydraulic systems, fleet vehicles, rail cars and shipping containers. Based on recent industry reports, and with industrial coatings generally comprising more than approximately a third of the worldwide aggregate coatings market, the oil and gas segment is one viewed by us as holding some of the greatest growth potential. Based on the preliminary results of early-stage field and lab tests being conducted by prospective customers, and though there can be no assurance, management believes the effectiveness of its products for this purpose is already higher than many competing products, and that the market and demand for these products is potentially very significant. We are aggressively targeting this application based on a combination of all of the factors identified above, and, to date, we have been pursuing potential distribution opportunities through select industry operators. 
Industrial and Residential HVAC Equipment, Commercial Refrigeration Systems, and Power Generators. This is the market segment application consisting of coatings for HVAC and commercial refrigeration systems intended to serve as protection from corrosion, including in salt water, acid, alkaline and chemical environments, and from clogging by particles of mold, pollen, dust, and soot. Substantial testing in this area by a variety of industry participants has shown that there is a significant efficiency loss factor on HVAC units due to natural oxidation and the restricted airflow resulting from dirt build-up on the condenser coils. With a product that repels moisture and contaminants, offers increased operating/energy efficiency of 12-15% over the life of a subject condensing unit, and substantially reduced cleaning requirements generally, management believes a significant opportunity exists for the Company within this market. Accordingly, we have targeted this application based on a combination of all of the factors identified above and are currently in the process of pursuing a strategic marketing plan aimed at this segment. 
Interior and Exterior Flooring and Tiling, Pavers and Hardscapes. This is the market segment defined by us to include applications involving surfaces consisting of pavers, poured and stamped concrete, natural stone, brick, ceramic tile and vinyl composition tile floors (“VCT”). It has been targeted based on a combination of all of the factors identified above, with a particular emphasis on (i) geographic accessibility to the regional market of South Florida, in which the Company maintains its executive offices and principal operations, and (ii) relative ease of installation. At a competitive price point, the Company’s products offer this market a high-grade, functional alternative to comparatively under-performing water-based hardscape sealants, and one with numerous unique, secondary benefits. The marketing and sales strategy being applied by us is a dual-pronged approach aimed at manufacturers of primary materials, on the one hand, and contractor installers, on the other. Our latest entrant into this market, V-Shield, is a single application ceramic coating that can last up to three years with minimal maintenance on VCT floors. Unlike traditional VCT cleaning and maintenance wax-based products, V-Shield saves time during the application as well as reduces the overall maintenance costs associated with VCT floors due to its single application process and longevity on such floors.

In general, though not necessarily across all segments, we intend to pursue a strategic approach to identify market opportunities that rely on master distribution arrangements within individual product/application industry verticals. An emphasis is being made in the immediate-term on the establishment of such master distribution relationships with prospective sellers that already have in place an industrial customer-base with the greatest likelihood of benefitting from our product(s) and, ideally, without there being an appreciable lag-time in customer adoption of our product because of its potential to effectively serve as an available upgrade to their existing offerings.
 
For purposes of development, competitive analysis, and prioritizing sales initiatives and resource deployment, we view our specialty coatings business in terms of numerous individual markets identified in each case by reference to the particular combination of our product, on the one hand, and targeted surface and application, on the other. While our complete line of individual specialty coatings products includes more than fifteen separate formulations, the following list identifies some of our largest selling products, by name, together with their respective primary targeted surfaces and application categories, as well certain information in each case relating to their unique benefits in relation to the target application.

Certain of the Science Behind Our Technology
 
The most unique feature shared by our coatings, and the specific focal point of a patent held by us and considered by management to be the centerpiece of our smart surface technology, is the positive surface charge they possess once applied. It is this positive surface charge that is responsible for their most unique and valuable properties identified above, including the hydrophobicity, oleophobicity, microbial and fungal resistance, dust-repellance, and the enhanced aerodynamics and hydrodynamics.

Hydrophobicity is a term largely unfamiliar to many outside scientific circles, but that describes a quality with which most everybody has a basic familiarity. Surfaces may be characterized as either hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on whether or not they attract or repel water or other water-based liquids. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces are abundant in both nature as well as in synthetic materials, and they exist both organically and inorganically in terms of chemical composition. A hydrophilic surface can be wet and may adsorb water; a hydrophobic surface cannot and will not – it is compositionally incapable of becoming wet. An example of a hydrophilic surface encountered routinely in daily life are sponges, which, of course, readily soak up whatever water with which they come into contact, at least to the point of saturation. Hydrophobic materials and coatings, by contrast, prevent water from pooling on their surfaces. In scientific terms, hybrophobicity is caused by surfaces that disrupt the hydrogen bonding in water; so as to minimize the disruption in its molecular makeup, the water droplet pushes itself away from the surface to minimize its contact area, thus becoming very tightly bound. Hydrophobic materials are generally easy to identify because water forms into droplets upon contact with them after which they tend to roll around freely, like marbles on a flat Formica countertop, as occurs commonly on the freshly waxed exterior of a car or recently cleaned windshield with new wiper blades. The more hydrophobic the material (all the way up to and including so-called “superhydrophobic” surfaces), the stronger this effect, until the water effectively floats or skims across the surface with what amounts to very low friction. Naturally occurring hydrophobic surfaces include many species of plant leaves and flower petals, as well as many types of bird feathers and the outer body parts of a variety of insects; the lotus leaf is among the most hydrophobic of naturally occurring hydrophobic surfaces. Synthetic hydrophobic surfaces include such household-name brands as Scotchgard™ ™ treated fabric, Teflon®® coated metal, or Rain-X®® coated glass.
 
Oleophobicity is a property very comparable to hydrophobicity, but it relates to oil-repellancy, not water-repellancy. There are important technical differences, but, for practical and basic observational purposes, they are very similar.
 
In terms of chemistry, our platform smart surface, and the coating variations identified above for which it serves as a basis, are inorganic, formed as they are of chemically “grown” glass. The process by which they form upon application can be likened to the process, witnessed by many daily in science classrooms, labs, or at home with popular science kits, whereby quartz crystals are effectively “grown” in a solution. This is important because it results in the establishment of a uniquely firm chemical bond between the coating and the surface, far stronger than would exist through either a mechanical or light bonding (the traditional alternatives), fundamentally setting the coatings apart from most others. When coupled with the unusually thin layer they inhabit – approximately 50 millionths to 1-2 thousandths of an inch – the combination of properties leaves them notably flexible, permitting their use in connection with such items as fabrics, plastics, and pliable floor-boards, yet hard, durable, and resilient, particularly when refined with select additives.
 
The additives used in our various coating formulations available to customers fall into three basic categories. In the first category are color tints, which, in recent years, have seen major technology advancements in terms of durability, variety and depth of color, reflectivity, and fade-resistance. We have available to us a wide range of the most advanced offerings in this regard. In the second category are additives intended to provide increased hardness and wear-resistance. Here, too, we have access to what we believe are some of the most superior materials available. In the third category are EPA-approved, “on-contact” mechanical microbial germ and virus (so-called) “quat” (industrial and commercial quaternary ammonium) killers. These additives work in such a way as to prohibit the mutation of microbials which can otherwise become resistant over time to chemical kill mechanisms such as antibiotics and are capable of fortifying any of our coatings with additional protection against bacteria and relatively large viruses/microbials, including, for example, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (more commonly known as “MRSA), Clostridium difficile bacterial infection (more commonly known as “C-diff”), and Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (more commonly known as “H1N1” or “Swine Flu”). By combining our coatings – which, based on their positive surface charge, already powerfully discourage the growth of many of the smaller, more common viruses which can exist between active elements of existing “on-contact” killers (such as the Norovirus, for example, a concern long plaguing the vacation cruise ship industry) – with a quat and certain other additives available to us, a unique, broader spectrum of microbial protection is afforded, un-matched, in the belief of the Company’s management, by any other product in anti-microbial effectiveness.
 
Long-Term Strategic Direction
 
Although there can be no assurance, over time, we intend to progress in the strategic direction of becoming a leading research-oriented high-tech specialty “smart-surface” materials development and licensing company centered around a highly qualified research team and state-of-the-art research lab and applying a combination of organic and inorganic chemistries, materials science engineering, and nanotechnology. We currently have developing expertise and capabilities in each of these areas.

Organic chemistry is a chemistry sub-discipline involving the scientific study of the structure, properties, and reactions of organic compounds and organic materials (i.e., matter in its various forms that contain carbon atoms). Inorganic chemistry, by contrast, refers to the chemistry sub-discipline aimed at understanding the synthesis and behavior of inorganic and organometallic compounds, generally focused on the silicon atom. Nanotechnology is the creation of functional materials, devices and systems through control of matter (atoms and molecules) on the nanometer length scale (1-500 nanometers), and exploitation of novel phenomena and properties (physical, chemical, biological, mechanical, electrical) at that length scale. Materials science engineering has as its focus, among others, the development of new products based on materials whose properties and behavior are controlled at the micrometer and nanometer scales, and through microfabrication technologies.
 
Manufacturing and Fulfillment
 
We currently conduct all manufacturing and fulfillment operations on our own at our facility in Lake Park, FL. Though output capacity is currently limited, we intend to expand in-house capacity in the near future, subject to our having available to us the requisite capital investment. The manufacturing process is comprised largely of combining and blending raw materials and chemicals, including additives, in each case consistent with our proprietary formulations, and bottling of final product into labeled, quart, gallon and larger containers. In general, on-hand inventory is kept to a minimum and built up based on forecasted near-term sales.
Backlog 
 
In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders and do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Accordingly, we do not believe that backlog information is material to an understanding of our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or other metric of financial performance.
Product Returns Policies and Warranties
 
Our product returns policies and warranties differ materially based on the type of surface to which our products are being applied as well as the anticipated performance life of the particular product.
 
In general, we maintain a consistent return policy relative to any products in relation to which there is either no associated installation or, if there is an installation involved, it is one in which we have no participation or for which we have any responsibility (as may be the case in relation to our paver application specialty coating products). The policy under such circumstances requires that the subject products be returned unopened within no more than 30 days of purchase, and that all shipping charges associated with the return be borne by the customer. For a period of up to five years from purchase, a warranty is extended in such cases to customers relative to both the chemical integrity (as represented upon sale) and the performance integrity of the coatings based on the specific characteristics of the subject product and application, and the corresponding representations made by the Company in relation thereto.
 
Our returns policies and product warranties are general policies and warranties and are subject to change in relation to any particular sale. Further, the general policies and warranties themselves are subject to change from time to time and are likely to evolve as our operations and revenues develop.
 
Significant Customers and Vendors
 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we generated a significant portion of our revenues from certain customers as follows:

 | 2017 | | 2016
Vendor A | | 24.97 | % | — | 
Vendor B | | 18.41 | % | 5.48 | %
Vendor C | | 17.33 | % | 54.73 | %

 
We currently have no long-term written agreements with any of these vendors. The payment terms are generally net 30 days, and we are not substantially dependent upon any one or more of them; all are easily replaceable with any locally or nationally available supplier.
 
Research and Development
 
Though a substantial and growing percentage of our operating expense, our research and development (“R&D”) has been very modest in recent years, in real dollar terms, due to a lack of allocable funds. The limited R&D activities that have been pursued over this period have been conducted exclusively in-house.
 
Our R&D objective is to leverage our unique, integrated, emerging science capabilities to drive revenue and margin growth. Our R&D initiatives are principally focused on our strategic priority of achieving a leadership position across the relatively higher margin, science-driven segments of the specialized coatings and surfaces markets in which it operates by developing and refining differentiated, advanced industrial and related coatings and surface materials. We believe that our specialized scientific expertise, together with our developing R&D program, combine to provide us with distinctive, competitive advantages that position us to establish broad global reach over time and deep market penetration in our market verticals.
 
Our EcoSmart R&D team consists of one full-time employee and two part-time personnel.
 
We continue to protect our R&D investments and assets through pursuit of a comprehensive intellectual property strategy. See discussion under “Intellectual Property.”
 
Regulation
 
We are subject to an extensive array of stringent regulations arising under a broad range of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws relating to the generation, storage, handling, discharge, disposition and stewardship of hazardous wastes and other harmful materials. These regulations have potential implications for us in terms of our manufacturing operations, product handling and use by customers and agents, as well as installation processes. In this regard, we will likely have to expend substantial amounts to comply with such laws and regulations as well as establish and maintain an evolving set of policies to minimize and control our environmental discharge and emissions. Nevertheless, legislative, regulatory and economic uncertainties (including existing and potential laws and regulations pertaining to climate change) may make it difficult for us to project future spending for these purposes and, if there is an acceleration in new regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend substantial additional funds to remain in compliance.

Competition
 
Product performance, technology, cost effectiveness, quality and technical and customer service are major competitive factors in the industrial coatings businesses. We are unaware of any one or more products possessing the same combination of physical properties, and that, on the whole, offers the same array of benefits, as its proprietary line of specialty smart surface coatings. There can be no assurance, however, that there not products under development or already in existence and in the early stages of market introduction of which management is not yet aware. The market for industrial and product performance coatings is extremely large, broad in scope, and consists of many different segments and sub-segments, each of which involves a range of product applications. It is also increasingly characterized by rapidly evolving technology. Precisely because of the wide array of beneficial properties they possess, and notwithstanding the U.S. patent held by us on our platform smart surface technology, the specialty coatings produced and distributed by us should be viewed as competing with other coatings products across a wide variety of the various existing market segments and sub-segments. Hydrophobic, anti-corrosion and antimicrobial coatings, for example, are each segments in which numerous companies are aggressively competing with one another worldwide, both in terms of technology and market share, but that, combined, represent only a minor portion of the aggregate competition that we should be viewed as meaningfully confronting.
 
The competition faced by us in relation to our proprietary line of specialty smart surface coatings includes both public and private organizations and collaborations among academic institutions and large companies, both domestic and foreign, most of which have significantly greater experience and financial resources than us. We expect that our most significant competitors will tend to be larger, more established companies, including many major multinational corporations such as Akzo Nobel N.V., PPG Industries, Inc., Axalta Coating Systems, and Valspar Corporation. In general, these companies are all developing products that, at some level or in one or more ways, compete with ours and, in addition to many existing issued and pending patents, they have significantly greater capital and other resources available to them for research and development, testing, seeking and obtaining any required regulatory approvals, marketing and distribution. In addition, many smaller coatings and related nanotechnology companies have formed strategic alliances or collaborative arrangements, partnerships, and other types of joint ventures with larger, well-established industry competitors that afford these companies’ potential research and development and commercialization advantages, and may be aided in becoming significant competitors through rapid evolution of new technologies. Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private dedicated research organizations are also financing and conducting research and development activities that could result in the introduction of products directly competitive to our own.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Patents and Licenses
 
The competitive environment in which we operate is largely driven by technology, proprietary or otherwise. In general, companies in this environment seek to develop competitive advantages – both offensive and defensive – through the obtaining and maintaining of relevant patents relating to their respective technological advancements. As a science and technology based company, we believe that securing intellectual property is an important part of protecting our research, and that, in particular, patent, as well as related trade secret, protection, is critical for the new specialty coatings technologies we develop, as well as any products and processes derived through them.
 
By way of assignment, we currently hold a United States patent relating to our smart surface specialty coatings technology:
 

Title | Awarded | Pending | Expiration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+---------+-----------
Method of Treating Surfaces For Self-Sterilization and Microbial Growth Resistance | X | | 2025 

 
Over time, we may apply for additional patents relating to advancements we achieve through our research and development initiatives. There can be no assurance however, that any the patent currently held, or any obtained in the future, will prove adequate to protect our technologies or that we will have sufficient financial and other resources to keep others from infringing the exclusive rights we possess in relation to our technologies. The fields in which we operate have been characterized by significant efforts by competitors to establish dominant or blocking patent rights to gain a competitive advantage, and by considerable differences of opinion as to the value and legal legitimacy of competitors’ purported patent rights and the technologies they actually utilize in their businesses.

Because we may license our technology and products in foreign markets, we may also seek foreign patent protection for some specific patents. With respect to foreign patents, the patent laws of other countries may differ significantly from those of the United States as to the patentability of our products or technology.
 
It is possible that competitors in both the United States and foreign countries, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may have applied for, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents, which will have an adverse impact on our ability to make and sell our products. There can also be no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patents or will not claim that we are infringing on their patents. Defense and prosecution of patent infringement suits, even if successful, are both costly and time consuming. An adverse outcome in the defense of a patent infringement suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or potentially even require us to cease our operations.
 
Trade Secrets
 
Certain aspects of our know-how and technology are not patentable, or, for strategic reasons, are best protected in the determination of management by leaving them unpatented. In this regard, trade secrets play an important part in our intellectual property strategy, and we vigilantly seek to protect them. To protect our proprietary position in trade secrets, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators with access to our technology to enter into confidentiality and invention ownership agreements with us. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. Further, in the absence of patent protection, competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technology, or otherwise acquire it, may adversely impact our business. If and when we discover that any trade secrets have been misappropriated, it is expected that we will, unless we otherwise determine for strategic or similar reasons, report the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, and to the extent that we have the available financial resources, we intend to take all reasonably required measures in an effort to mitigate any potential adverse economic impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on losses sustained by us and/or unjust enrichment by a counter-party.
 
We are currently in the process of evaluating our options in connection with the registering of trademarks for our specialty coatings business, and this process is expected to be ongoing. Unlike patent rights, ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected.
 
ADVANCED CEMENT SCIENCES (VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY)
 
Advanced Cement Sciences LLC (“ACS”) is a variable interest entity of which the Company owned a minority 31.06% interest at December 31, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2016 management determined that the Company was the primary beneficiary based on qualitative and quantitative factors, and has since been consolidating the entity in accordance with U.S. GAAP for purposes of our financial reporting. ACS is a Florida-based, engineered cement technology and products firm founded in September 2016 and currently focused on globally marketing a line of proprietary admixtures it has acquired the rights to and further internally developed to be used in the production of ultra-lightweight, high-strength concrete and high-performance stucco. The business of ACS has undergone a gradual but fundamental transformation since the second quarter of 2017 (following the negotiated withdrawal of one of its founding members) from having as its primary focus the development and enhancement of applied nanotechnologies to materials development generally, on the one hand, to the development, manufacturing and sales of very competitively-priced, premium-performance concrete- and stucco-enhancing admixture products that rely on certain nanotechnologies, on the other. Management believes the prospects for ACS are extraordinary based on its advanced, engineered and proprietary cement chemistry coupled with the sheer magnitude of the global markets in relation to which they offer a meaningful value proposition. Specifically, ACS views its products as having the capability to substantially improve the net economics of any business:

▪ | building or making products from concrete or stucco; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | where there is additional economic value to be mined by using a concrete or stucco that has either:
 | ▪ | a substantially increased per unit strength than that currently being used,
 | ▪ | a substantially reduced per unit weight/density, or 
 | ▪ | both. 


- 11 -
------

Although it is still in the earliest stage of products commercialization and revenue development, our management team and certain members of our operations personnel devote a very significant and growing percentage of their working time to the business of ACS. Our president and chief executive officer, Steven Malone, serves as a managing member of ACS with what is effectively the senior-most level of fiscal and operational responsibility for the firm.
 
Technology
 
The ACS core technology centers around what are believed by management to be two meaningfully proprietary advances in concrete materials engineering:
 

▪ | Industrial chemistry formulations that result in multi-functional, ultra-high-performance concrete and stucco end-products that possess physical, flexural, chemical, and structural properties believed by management to be unparalleled in their respective U.S. domestic and global markets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Methodologies for the custom blending, bonding and assimilation of base catalytic chemistries with a variety of industrial nanofibers and nanoparticles such that the net results are concrete and stucco end-products carrying a broad array of application-specific, custom-enhanced properties and high-performance characteristics.

 
Taken as a whole, management believes that the ACS platform technology is not merely a finite assortment of formulations from which certain useful products have been derived, but rather an ever-evolving continuum of custom-blended concrete and stucco admixture variations subtly adaptable to meet an endless array of specific industrial applications and needs.
 
ACS is achieving results in the performance and other characteristics of its nano-engineered catalytic chemistry that management believes are unparalleled in a variety of ways, and in some of those ways by a wide margin. It is doing this by using internally developed, largely unconventional and proprietary combinations of materials and chemistry, including advanced compound assimilation methodologies believed by management to be unique to ACS.
 
Beyond its unique and proprietary concrete and stucco admixture formulations themselves, ACS has additionally developed an advanced product delivery system unparalleled in the industry that dramatically simplifies the process associated with mixing and preparing end-product, effectively rendering it mistake-proof. ACS’s “AdPacks,” named for their novel combining of the concrete industry admixture concept with that of a pre-mixed, ready-to-go package, contain a dense, viscous cake-mix style assortment of pre-measured and combined contents constituting a base product which, when combined on a production line or job site with cement, water and most commonly used concrete or stucco aggregates in accordance with provided instructions and supplemental videos, results in an end-product with notably superior characteristics for its particular purposes. The ACS AdPacks are available in off-the-shelf SKUs as well as custom formulations, and can be delivered in bag-sizes, totes or drums to meet quantity requirements at all industry levels.
 
Intellectual Property
 
ACS’s proprietary base concrete and stucco-enhancement intellectual property formulations have been acquired by one of the principals of one of its founding members, and improved upon through internal research and development initiatives.
Products and Markets
 
At the broadest industrial level, and at each of the U.S. domestic and global levels, there are two basic customer categories within the concrete and stucco family of products, both of which ACS intends to serve:

- 12 -
------


▪ | Manufacturers who rely on concrete to make precast products they sell for use by property owners, developers, contractors, and builders; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Developers, contractors and builders who rely on ready-mix or mix-on-site concrete and stucco for pour-in-place and tilt-up construction projects they develop, manage, and build.

 
With end-product that tends to be very bulky, heavy and prone to breakage in transport, and with only minor exception, those in the first group are believed by management to naturally covet a concrete that is many times lighter in weight than standard concrete, and that features a flexural strength that preserves the integrity of their product where it would otherwise fail (crack or break), but only if the cost of using it is meaningfully lower on a net, all-in basis. Although there are others, some of which are very large, initially targeted markets by ACS within this group include the following, in relation to which ACS believes it can most rapidly achieve meaningful revenue growth and market penetration:
 

▪ | Producers of concrete interior and exterior “manufactured stone” panels and veneers, architectural trim and decorative pieces (Product: ACS Ultra-Lightweight Design Formula AdPack); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Concrete block (Product: ACS Ultra-Lightweight Block Formula AdPack). 

 
With end-product that consumes vast amounts of concrete to achieve required compressive and tensile strength levels, those in the second group are believed by management to covet concrete and stucco materials that are substantially stronger than standard offerings, thus enabling the use of substantially less material to achieve comparable strength, but, here too, only if the cost of using it is meaningfully lower on a net, all-in basis. Although the largest markets within this group consist of those developers, contractors and builders using ready-mix or mix-on-site concrete for pour-in-place and tilt-up construction projects, and ACS intends to pursue those markets in time with products currently under development and testing, initially targeted markets by ACS within this group are limited solely to stucco, in relation to which ACS believes it can most rapidly achieve meaningful revenue growth and market penetration. For this vertical, ACS offers its Ultra-High-Performance Stucco Formula AdPack.
 
Sales initiatives for ACS product have been underway for only several months as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and such initiatives have been, intentionally due to production constraints, slow to develop and limited to those aimed strictly at the “manufactured stone” market and, more recently, the stucco market. Given the realities of new product introductions generally, and the need in the case of ACS products to not only evidence product compliance with existing building codes and related industrial standards, but also demonstrate product workability and efficacy through showcase projects, positive customer experiences, and industry expert references and endorsements, ACS is yet to achieve any meaningful degree of sales traction for either of those product lines and, to date, sales have been very limited and deliberately targeted towards customers that view their use of the product as part of a series of final-stage, semi-pilot projects. In the meantime, steady efforts have been underway towards enabling ACS’s ability to systematically provide evidence of product compliance with existing building codes and related industrial standards within identified markets, as well as to readily demonstrate product workability and efficacy through showcase projects, positive customer experiences, and industry expert references and endorsements within such markets.
 
Manufacturing and Marketing
 
To date, and beyond that associated with continuing product research and development, manufacturing and packaging of ACS product has been low-rate, batch only (i.e. non-automated). Systems design and planning for automated production and packaging are currently in the early stages of development, though implementation will be dependent on the availability of required financing. In the meantime, acceptance of purchase orders will necessarily be constrained by very limited production capacity.
 
Subject to the availability of required financing, for which there can be no assurance, ACS’s 2-year manufacturing and marketing development plan is highlighted by the following key objectives:
 

- 13 -
------


▪ | implementing strategic intellectual property initiatives aimed at minimizing vulnerabilities for all product lines; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | building out manufacturing capacity and operations for each of the Ultra-Lightweight Formula AdPack (including concrete block) as well as Ultra High-Performance Stucco Formula AdPack product lines;
▪ | building out the marketing and sales operations organization for those same product lines; and 
▪ | continuing R&D initiatives in respect of all product lines. 

 
Historically, the handling of nanofibers and nanoparticles has been widely recognized as posing significant health and safety concerns and challenges stemming from the potentially hazardous particulates emitted into the air during the production, transport, and use of these materials. These emissions occur because, in the absence of industry-appropriate methods, processes and practices for the containment of otherwise loose, airborne particulates, such matter can get drawn into the eyes, the throat and lungs, and onto the skin, of those individuals handling or otherwise being exposed to these materials. Such exposure can lead to a variety of health and safety concerns. In relation to the production of those ACS admixture products that rely on the incorporation of nanoparticle-enhanced nanofibers, therefore, and although there can be no assurance that any safety precautions will prove reliable against any and all vulnerabilities in all instances, ACS has adopted and utilizes what it has deemed to be reasonably suitable methods and practices for the containment of these hazardous substances.
 
Backlog 
 
In general, ACS does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Accordingly, we do not believe that ACS backlog information is material to an understanding of our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of ACS’s or our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or other metric of financial performance.
 
Strategic Alliance with FIND
 
In pursuing its stated objectives, and since ACS’s inception, a strategic relationship has been gradually evolving between the Company and ACS that affords certain benefits to each. Increasingly, and because of ACS’s lack of independent resources and certain of FIND’s available resources, ACS has come to rely on FIND to perform virtually all of its business functions. Specifically, this has included commercializing, manufacturing, packaging, inventorying, globally marketing, distributing, and - strictly as an agent for ACS - selling, for the account of ACS, all ACS products. The general rationale behind the development of this strategic alliance is based upon the existence of the following factors:
 


▪ | Alignment of economic interests through our percentage ownership of ACS; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Flex-availability for ACS for an indeterminate period of: 
 | ► | qualified and capable managerial and operational talent in relation to each of manufacturing, marketing, and sales;
 | ► | qualified and capable operational, office and administrative support; and 
 | ► | underutilized physical operational/production resources/capacity; 
▪ | Access for ACS to public capital markets; and 
▪ | Core-competency synergies between our existing business and operations and those of ACS: industrial chemical and compounds development, manufacturing and distribution.

 
Although steps have been taken in the direction of formalizing this relationship with a much more comprehensive definitive agreement between the two entities, and it is expected by us that such an agreement will be established in the near future, for the time being, FIND is, as it has been since September, 2016, performing its services for ACS, as well as financing expenditures on behalf of ACS, on what has recently been agreed to between the entities as a cost-plus-10% basis. As of December 31, 2017, and subject to potential future adjustment for unaccounted-for allocations, the principal-only amount owed by ACS to FIND associated with this obligation was $94,425. See Note 3 “Consolidated Variable Interest Entity” of the Footnotes to the Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

CORPORATE INFORMATION
 
Corporate Formation, Legacy, History & Subsidiaries 
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 7, 1997 as EJH Entertainment, Inc. On December 4, 1997, a predecessor corporation with the same name as our own but domiciled in Idaho was merged with and into us. Although the predecessor Idaho corporation was without material assets or operations as of the time of the merger, since being organized in 1968, it had historically been involved in mining and entertainment businesses unrelated to our current business.
 
Beginning in 1997, and although we were not then a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, our common stock was quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (originally under the symbol “TIXX”, which was later changed to “TIXXD”). On May 13, 1999, we changed our name to FINdex.com, Inc. On March 7, 2000, in an effort to satisfy a then recently imposed NASD Rule eligibility requirement that companies quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board be fully reporting under the Securities Exchange Act (thereby requiring recently audited financial statements) and current in their filing obligations, we acquired, as part of a share exchange in which we issued 150,000 shares of our common stock, all of the outstanding capital stock of Reagan Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation. At the time of this transaction, Reagan Holdings was subject to the requirements of having to file reports pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act, had recently audited financial statements and was current in its reporting obligations. Having no operations, employees, revenues or other business plan at the time, however, it was a public shell company. As a result of this transaction, Reagan Holdings, Inc. became our wholly owned subsidiary and we became the successor issuer to Reagan Holdings for reporting purposes pursuant to Rule 12g-3 of the Securities Exchange Act. Shortly thereafter, we changed our stock symbol to “FIND”. Though it does not currently have any operations, employees, or revenues, Reagan Holdings remains our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
In addition to Reagan Holdings, we also have one other wholly owned subsidiary, Findex.com, Inc. (i.e. the same name as our own), a Delaware corporation. Like Reagan Holdings, this entity, too, does not currently have any operations, employees, or revenues. This subsidiary resulted from an acquisition on April 30, 1999 pursuant to which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of FINdex Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, from its then stockholders in exchange for 4,700,000 shares of our common stock, which, immediately following the transaction, represented 55% of our total outstanding common stock. Our purpose for this acquisition (under a previous management) was to broaden our then-existing stockholder base, an important factor in our effort to develop a strong market for our common stock. On May 12, 1999, in exchange for the issuance of 457,625 shares of FINdex Acquisition Corp. common stock, FINdex.com, Inc., another Delaware corporation (originally incorporated in December 1995 as FinSource, Ltd.), was merged with and into FINdex Acquisition Corp., with FINdex Acquisition Corp. remaining as the surviving entity. Our purpose for this merger (under a previous management) was to acquire a proprietary financial information search engine for the Internet which was to serve as the cornerstone for a Web-based development-stage business, but which has since been abandoned. As part of the certificate of merger relating to this transaction, FINdex Acquisition Corp. changed its name to FINdex.com, Inc. We currently own 4,700,000 shares of FINdex.com, Inc. (the Delaware corporation), representing 100% of its total outstanding common stock.
 
On July 23, 2014, we merged with EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc., a Florida corporation (“EcoSmart Florida”). Because, for accounting purposes, this merger was treated in accordance with ASC 805-40, Reverse Acquisitions, and Findex was recognized as the accounting acquiree in relation thereto with EcoSmart Florida as the accounting acquirer, our consolidated financial statements for the reporting period from January 1, 2013 through July 23, 2014 were those of EcoSmart Florida, not the enterprise historically recognized as Findex. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements for the periods since July 24, 2014, the day after which the merger was consummated, recognize Findex and EcoSmart Florida as a single operating enterprise and entity for accounting and reporting purposes, albeit with a carryover capital structure inherited from Findex (attributable to the legal structure of the transaction). Readers of this annual report on Form 10-K should note that, in order to provide materially relevant disclosure regarding certain of Findex’s historical, operational expenses not otherwise appropriately accounted for in our consolidated financial statements given the applied accounting treatment described herein, certain disclosure is contained in the text of this report relating to such expenses, including e.g. executive compensation, director compensation, and audit fees, that does not numerically align with the corresponding figures contained in our consolidated financial statements.

Prior to the merger with EcoSmart Florida, and since 1999, our business had been developing, publishing, marketing, distributing and direct-selling off-the-shelf consumer and organizational software products for the Windows platform. Following divestitures of two software titles which had consistently accounted for the overwhelming majority of our revenues while owned by us, including our Membership Plus product line, which we sold in late 2007, and our flagship QuickVerse product line, which we sold during 2011, and title acquisitions during the same period that, in the aggregate, had been relatively insignificant in offsetting the loss of revenues associated with those major divestitures, our continuing operations, while not nominal, had been very limited and insubstantial in terms of revenue, both relative to what they had been prior thereto and by any appropriate standalone measure. Specifically, our operations immediately prior to the merger with EcoSmart Florida consisted exclusively of those relating to the FormTool line of products which we acquired in February 2008, as well as two language tutorial products, which were retained after the sale of the QuickVerse product line. Due to a continuing lack of capital over a number of years, we were unable to meaningfully grow the FormTool line and develop related products, and our business and financial prospects became increasingly challenged. Since the merger with EcoSmart Florida, our primary focus has shifted away from the continued development of our FormTool line and much more intently in the direction of our surfaces and coatings business, where we believe the opportunities for our future growth are greater and have significantly more to offer economically.
 
In its most recent corporate form, EcoSmart Florida was organized in 2012. The patents and other intellectual property forming the foundation of the EcoSmart business were originally developed during a preceding period dating back to 2003 in which it was operated by the developers of the Company’s technologies as Surface Modification Technologies, Inc. (“SMT”), a Florida corporation, and EcoSmart, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, which were sold together to The Renewable Corporation, a Florida based company with its common stock then traded in the over-the-counter market (“TRC”) in 2012. On January 20, 2012, EcoSmart Coating Technologies, Inc., a Florida corporation, was organized as a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRC. Simultaneously, EcoSmart Surface Technologies, Inc., also a Florida corporation, was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRC. With common ownership by TRC, the assets of each of SMT and EcoSmart, LLC were thereafter transferred in part to EcoSmart Coating Technologies, Inc. with the remainder to EcoSmart Surface Technologies, Inc. On September 18, 2012, EcoSmart Surface Technologies, Inc. changed its name to EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc. On October 19, 2012, EcoSmart Coating Technologies, Inc. was merged with and into EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc., leaving EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc. as the surviving corporation.
 
The Company became the holder of its minority equity stake in ACS in mid-September, 2016. Through two private holding entities owned jointly with our general counsel, Michael Membrado, and exclusive of indirect interests held through ownership of Company common stock (disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), our president and chief executive officer, Steven Malone, currently holds a combined approximate 13% equity interest in ACS, primarily through an ownership interest in one of its founding members, Nanotech Fibers, LLC.
 
Employees
 
As of April 17, 2018, we had seven full-time and one part-time employees/contractors. Three full-time employee/contractors are part of the senior-level executive team, one full-time employees/contractors and two part-time employee/contractor are part of the product research and development and business development team, one part-time employee/contractor is part of the marketing, customer service and sales team, one full-time employee/contractor is part of the manufacturing team, and one full-time employee/contractor is part of the financial management and administration team.
 
We rely heavily on our current officers and directors in operating the business. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe that our relationships with our employees/contractors are good.
 
Principal Executive Offices and Contact Information
 
Our executive offices are located at 1313 South Killian Drive, Lake Park, FL 33403, and our main telephone number at that address is 561-328-6488.
