Description of Business and History
 We were incorporated on October 26, 2009 in the State of Nevada. We originally were engaged in the development of a website and also the design and development of a catalogue to sell over the counter and prescription medications, and supplements. In 2012, we undertook a change in focus to the natural resources sector where we engaged in the acquisition and exploration of base metals and mineral mining properties.
 
On April 5, 2016, we completed the purchase of Viva Entertainment Group, Inc. (“Viva Entertainment”), a Delaware corporation, from EMS Find, Inc. (“EMS”) pursuant to a stock purchase agreement. Viva Entertainment’s Chief Executive Officer, Johnny Falcones, was appointed as our sole director, President and Chief Executive Officer to manage the development and marketing of Viva Entertainment’s over the top (IPTV/OTT) application for connected TV’s, desktop computers, tablets, and smart phones.
 
Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, we and EMS agreed to transfer control of Viva Entertainment to us through the purchase of all outstanding shares of stock of Viva Entertainment by us in exchange for the issuance to EMS of a 10% promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000, due six months from the closing (the “EMS Note”), and the issuance of 22,000,000 shares of common stock to Johnny Falcones. For accounting purposes, the transaction was treated as a reverse merger since the acquired entity now forms the basis for operations and the transaction resulted in a change in control, with the acquired company electing to become the successor issuer for reporting purposes. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared to reflect the assets, liabilities and operations of Viva Entertainment Group, Inc. exclusive of Black River Petroleum since all predecessor operations were discontinued. As part of the transaction, stock payable and amounts due to former officers were forgiven, with the balances recorded under additional paid in capital. For equity purposes, additional paid-in capital and retained deficit shown are those of Viva, exclusive of Black River Petroleum. Viva had no operations prior to the quarter ended April 30, 2016.
 
Viva Entertainment Group Inc. (F/K/A Black River Petroleum Corp.) (the “Company”) develops and markets Viva Entertainment’s over the top (IPTV/OTT) application for connected TV’s, desktop computers, tablets, and smart phones. We are based in Briarwood, New York.

Strategy
 
We develop and market Viva Entertainment’s over the top (IPTV/OTT) application for connected TV’s, desktop computers, tablets, and smart phones.
 
Competition
 
Our products and industry as a whole are subject to extreme competition.  There is no guarantee that we can develop or sustain a market position or expand our business.  We anticipate that the intensity of competition in the future will increase.
 We compete with a number of entities in providing products to our customers.  Such competitor entities include: Chromecast, Apple TV, and Roku. Many of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition than we have.  As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with both existing and potential customers.  They also may be able to offer more products and more aggressively promote and sell their products.  Our competitors may also be able to support more aggressive pricing than we will be able to, which could adversely affect sales, cause us to decrease our prices to remain competitive, or otherwise reduce the overall gross profit earned on our products.
 We believe that our key competitive advantages are:
 (1) Our ability to produce high quality yet low cost content on a high volume basis
 (2) Ongoing industry relations with key companies and their respective executives to facilitate increase of affiliate relations
 (3) Tenure in the marketplace with key advertising clients
 (4) Certification as a minority-majority owned media company through our OI2 Venture
 (5) Upgrading our technology at all times 
 
Government Regulations
 
The sale of software products is taxed at the federal, state and local levels, as well as at the international levels.  Our operations may be subject to more restrictive regulations and increased taxation by international, federal, state and local governmental agencies than are those of hardware and software related businesses. In such event, we have to raise prices on our products in order to maintain profit margins. The effect of such an increase could negatively impact our sales or profitability.
Research and Development 
 
We have not incurred any research and development expenditures over the past two fiscal years.
 
Employees
 
We currently have four employees consisting of Johnny Falcones, our officer and director, Edwin Batiz, our Urban Marketing President, Alberto Gomez, our Viva Entertainment President, and John Sepulveda, our Latin American President. Over the next 12 months, we intend to engage consultants to consult with us on specific corporate affairs or to perform specific tasks in connection with our Viva Entertainment operations.
Intellectual Property
 
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks.
