On April 22, 2015, we incorporated Her Marketing Concepts, Inc. (“Her Marketing”), a Nevada corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary. Since November 28, 2016, all employees of the Company are employed by Her Marketing using a Professional Employment Organization otherwise known as a PEO. Her Marketing partners with the PEO to provide comprehensive human resources outsourcing to help manage our human resources, employee benefits, regulatory compliance, and payroll outsourcing. A PEO works through a co-employment arrangement, which means the PEO contractually shares certain employer responsibilities with us.
 
On September 15, 2016, we purchased 150,000 of our common shares from admaxoffers.com (“admax”), an unaffliated shareholder, by issuing a promissory note for $60,000 payable monthly in equal installments of $5,000 until fully paid. Assuming an implied interest rate of 6.5%, the value of the note booked as a payment was $57,940. As part of this transaction Admax agreed that it would not sell any free-trading shares for a period of one year from the transaction date. On November 25, 2016, we purchased an additional 500,000 common shares of Her from Admax for $25,000 cash.
 
On November 28, 2016, we entered into an Asset Share Purchase & Business Agreement with Cabello Real Ltd. (“Cabello”), a private United Arab Emeritus company, to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to the Her Imports trademark. In exchange for these rights, and other digital assets, we issued to Cabello ten million shares of our unregistered non-voting, non-cumulative, callable preferred stock and 7,500,000 of our unregistered common stock. In addition to conveyance of the Her Imports trademark rights, we purchased certain other assets owned by Cabello, including customer lists and various digital content. Simultaneously, we terminated our Marketing and Selling Agreement with Her Holding, Inc. (“Her Holding”) (See also below section titled Agreements with Her Imports, LLC).
 
On January 12, 2017, we changed our name from EZJR, Inc. to Her Imports.
 
On January 31, 2017, we effected a 1-for- 2 reverse stock split effective January 31, 2017. The par value was not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. All references to numbers of shares of our common stock and per-share information in this Form 10-K and the accompanying financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the split.
 
Business
 
We are a retailer of Human Hair Extensions and related haircare and beauty products headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. We sell our products at consultation studios and on our eCommerce Website, www.herimports.com. As of December 31, 2017, we operated 24 retail locations, all of which are in the U.S (one of which was closed on that date). These locations are primarily in “executive offices suites” such as Regus PLC, where furniture, administrative staff and security are provided. We then stock the location with products and point-of-sale equipment. These locations are leased on a short-term basis (primarily one year or less). This allows us to open and close our consultation studios with a minimal amount of time and expense. At the consultation studio, the customer is provided with a personal, one-on-one consultation with a Her beauty expert. Additionally, we have one larger location in Greenbelt Maryland where there are several consultants as well as a waiting room. We stock each of our leased locations with products and point-of-sale equipment. Three leases, including our corporate office, had leases longer than one year at the time they were entered into.
 
Agreements with Her Imports, LLC, Her Holding, Inc., and termination of the Agreement
 
On October 1, 2014, we entered into a Marketing and Selling Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Her Imports, LLC (the “LLC”), a retailer of human hair extensions and related products. Under the agreement, we were to custom design the LLC’s ecommerce Websites and generate customer leads through email marketing campaigns, online advertising and social media and various affiliate marketing campaigns. Additionally, we were to sell LLC’s products as well as other products to these customers. As part of the Agreement, we purchased LLC’s inventory that was on hand at September 30, 2014 in exchange for a Secured Promissory Note.

In addition to our selling the LLC’s products online, LLC’s products were sold at independent retail locations. As part of the Agreement, we reimburse the LLC for the expenses of these locations, employee costs, connectivity expenses and certain other expenses as agreed upon. We make all retail sales and processed through a Point-of-Sale (POS) system implemented by us. Additionally, we reimbursed the LLC for specific customer service costs, warehousing, and fulfillment expenses. Finally, we paid the LLC a 10% royalty on net sales. In return, the LLC provided us with assistance in developing and sourcing of products, promotion of products, employee training, customer service and high-level location management. On November 14, 2014, the Agreement was modified to allow any payments that we made on behalf of the LLC to be offset against any royalty payments. Effective September 1, 2015, we issued 2,000,000 shares of restricted common stock valued at $2,200,000 to Her Holding in exchange for a reduction in the royalty cash payments to 2.5%. Additionally, we agreed to pay for certain connectivity, telephony and customer service expenses that heretofore were paid by LLC.
 
On November 28, 2016, simultaneous with the termination of the Her Holding agreements as described above, we entered into an Asset Share Purchase & Business Agreement with Cabello Real Ltd. as also described above and we hired all the LLC’s and Her Holding’s employees and assumed all location leases. At the time of that agreement termination, we wrote off $977,066 in unamortized prepaid royalties and $362,447 of advances to Her Holding that were forgiven in return for termination of the agreement. This resulted in a loss on termination of the agreement of $1,339,514. As a result of this transaction, our business going forward and continuing to date, concentrates on the Hair Extension and related products business.
 
Our goal is to expand our retail locations into additional markets to the extent funding and operation logistics make such expansion feasible. Additionally, we plan to expand the product offerings in our studios and on our website.
 
eCommerce Platform
 
On May 28, 2014, we entered an Asset Purchase Agreement with Leader Act Ltd HK, (“Leader”) a private Hong Kong corporation to purchase an ecommerce Platform (“Platform”) software program developed and owned by Leader. The Platform entails all aspects of interaction that a company has with its customer, whether it is sales or service-related, provides a greater understanding of the customer and helps manage customer data and all interaction with the customer. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Leader agreed to service and maintain the software for a period of two years. For the Platform and service and maintenance, we issued Leader 5,000,000 restricted shares of common stock valued at $0.10 per share. For financial reporting purposes, $350,000 of the purchase price was allocated to the Platform and $150,000 was allocated to the software maintenance agreement, which was booked as a prepaid at the date of the acquisition and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the two-year term of the agreement. This agreement expired in May 2016. On October 13, 2016, we entered into a five-year maintenance agreement on the Platform with Leader in exchange for 3,000,000 shares of our common stock valued at $375,000.
 
Media Investor Purchaser Agreement
 
On June 29, 2014, the Company entered into a Media Investor Purchaser Agreement (“MIP Agreement”) with Leader. On July 31, 2017, the MIP Agreement was assigned by Leader to Cabello. Under the terms of the MIP Agreement, Cabello undertakes the responsibility to provide the investment dollars for the “media purchase.” The purpose of this media purchase is to generate revenues from the sale of various products and services. When revenues are generated they are split on a 50/50 basis after deducting direct expenses and fees related to the revenues the media purchase, merchant fees, product costs, and affiliate fees. Cabello is responsible for lead generation by spending the funds necessary to purchase various media while managing the overall process. Cabello is also responsible for graphic design, Website design and various other programming expenses. Conversely, we are responsible for customer service, network costs, accounting, and any other related general and administrative costs. Prior to signing the agreement Leader advanced us $50,000 which the agreement allowed to be converted to 500,000 shares of common at $0.05 per share. Under the MIP Agreement, Cabello has an option to purchase up to 9,500,000 shares of common stock that Cabello can purchase at $0.05 per share from its portion of the funds generated by the offers it creates. The number of shares and price per share will not be affected by our proposed reverse split (and one that we affected in 2017) since the MIP Agreement does not contain an adjustment clause any option proceeds are subject to the MIP Agreement and the 50/50 split described above.

Growth Strategy
 
Our growth strategy consists of the following key elements:
 

● | Expand our geographic reach. We plan to add new retail locations throughout the United States. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Broaden our addressable market. Currently our market consists primary of African American Women. We believe that we can expand our business by addressing the needs of other ethnic groups in the U.S. 
● | Expand our product offering. We plan to add new styles of hair extensions and wigs as the market demands. Additionally, we plan to offer a broader range of haircare and beauty products. 

Products
 
Currently, the products we sell fall into three general categories as follows:
 

● | Human hair extensions and related human hair products. Our hair extensions come in a variety of styles for a variety of uses. We currently focus on products that are woven into existing hair on the human scalp. However, recently, we have begun sourcing and selling products often referred to as “clip-ins” that can temporarily be installed and then removed for later reuse. Finally, we are now exploring selling full, high quality wigs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Hair care products. We currently sell eight different hair care products, all under the brand OSIworks. The products include various shampoos and conditioners, specifically designed and formulated for use with human hair extensions. Additionally, we also sell an adhesive to be used in extension installation called Cling. Cling is not water soluble and, as a result, allow the wearer of hair extension to participate in activities such as swimming, water sports and jogging without fear that the installation of the extensions may be affected. 
● | Beauty products and related accessories. We sell a variety of beauty related accessories including silk bonnets, styling tools, and makeup. Styling tools include flatirons and curling irons and are sold under the brand Her Imports. Makeup is sold under the brand Skin & Yang. 

Customers
 
Our customers tend to be African-American women who wish to have longer hair. We sell other product offerings to other ethnic groups to expand our customer base.
Customer Acquisition
 
We obtain customers through two primary channels, online marketing and traditional media.
 
Online Marketing. 
 
To acquire customers, we are currently using a variety of low-cost marketing tactics including:
 

● | Social Media including Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Develop relationships with hair stylists for referrals. 
● | Using email and text messaging to our existing customer base and potential customers who have registered on our website. 

Traditional Media
 
In addition to the above, during 2016 we acquired a significant number of social media “followers” by using radio advertising. While this method of obtaining customers was significantly more expensive than our current approach we did build our database of potential customers that we are now leveraging through social media. However, it appears that local radio appears to be the most cost effective in smaller markets.
 
In the future, we plan to further explore additional traditional forms of attracting new customers, including, but not limited to, celebrity endorsements, public relations and events.

Competitors
 
Hair Extensions. There are many competitors that sell hair extensions including individuals, salons, mall kiosks and online stores.
 
Some of our competitors include:
 
AliExpress
 Queen Virgin Remy
 Go Naked Hair
 Bella Dream Hair
 Extensions Plus
 Bellami Hair
 Indique Hair
 
Certain of these competitors have physical locations while the majority only sell online. Some competitors only sell low-quality synthetic hair. We believe that we sell the highest quality product at a competitive price, primarily because we only sell 100% human hair.
 
Our competitive disadvantages are:
 

● | Many of our competitors sell inferior products at lower prices. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Customers have a difficult time differentiating between vendors of human hair extensions. 
● | We do not currently address all geographical areas in the U.S. with our consultation studios. 

 
We intend to compete against our competitors through the following methods:
 

● | Offering superior products to our customers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Educating our customers regarding quality issues for human hair extensions. 
● | Providing accessory products to our customers. 
● | Expanding our geographical reach by opening new retail locations. 
● | Providing a superior online shopping experience to our customers. 

Seasonality
 
The business areas in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuations due to the ability of our customers to pay for products, which ability correspond to product demand. Our revenues have historically been better during tax season which falls at the end of the first quarter through the beginning of the second quarter, while our revenues have experienced declines in the latter part of summer. As such, past quarterly results are not indicative of future results and may be subject to seasonal fluctuations.
Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements
 
On November 28, 2016, we purchased the Her Imports trademark for exclusive use in the United States. With the exception of the Her Imports trademark, we have no trademarks, patents, licenses, franchises, concessions, or royalty agreements. We rely on a combination of trade secret and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We will rely on copyright laws to protect our future computer programs and our proprietary databases.
Government Regulations 
 
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States. Our business is subject to the CAN-SPAM Act as defined below and similar laws adopted by a number of states, which regulate unsolicited commercial emails, create criminal penalties for emails containing fraudulent headers and control other abusive online marketing practices.
 
The tax reform bill that Congress voted to approve December 20, 2017, also known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, made sweeping modifications to the Internal Revenue Code, including a much lower corporate tax rate, changes to credits and deductions, and a move to a territorial system for corporations that have overseas earnings.
 
The act replaced the prior-law graduated corporate tax rate, which taxed income over $10 million at 35%, with a flat rate of 21%.
 
Similarly, the Federal Trade Commission, has guidelines that impose responsibilities on us with respect to communications with consumers and impose fines and liability for failure to comply with rules with respect to advertising or marketing practices they may deem misleading or deceptive or involve unfair trade practices. Many states have “little FTC Acts” which provide for triple damages and attorney’s fees resulting  from unfair trade practices.
