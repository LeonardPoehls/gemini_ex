ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
GTT Communications, Inc. ("GTT," the "Company," "we," or "us") provides cloud networking services to multinational clients. We operate a Tier 1 global IP backbone, ranked among the top five in the industry, and we own the lowest latency, transatlantic fiber network. Our comprehensive portfolio of services includes: private networking; internet; optical transport; SD-WAN; managed services; voice and unified communications; video transport; and access services. 
Our global network connects people across organizations and around the world. We provide cloud networking services to leading multinational enterprise, carrier, and government clients in over 100 countries. We differentiate ourselves from our competition by delivering service to our customers with simplicity, speed and agility.
We are a Delaware corporation founded in 2005. As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,257 full-time equivalent employees.
Strategy
Multinational organizations are shifting greater amounts of traffic to cloud-based applications and outsourcing IT infrastructure services, which creates significant opportunities for GTT. Our global networking services are designed to capitalize on these growing market demands, most notably our private networking, internet, optical transport, SD-WAN, and managed services offerings. We believe our broad network reach and differentiated service capabilities uniquely position GTT to serve the changing networking requirements of multinational clients.
Our strategy is focused on three key elements:
Expanding cloud networking services to multinational clients. Our network assets and services are built to serve the requirements of large, global clients. These organizations have increasing demands for scalable and flexible network connectivity due to the rapid adoption of cloud-based applications and increasing data usage across locations driven by increasing file sizes, voice, video and real-time collaboration tools. In addition, enterprise CIOs and technology executives are increasingly using third-party management of their network and IT infrastructure so their teams can focus on application development and performance. We are one of the few non-incumbent providers with the product breadth, global scope and operating experience to meet the sophisticated networking needs and managed service requirements of the world’s most demanding multinational clients, and we will continue to look for ways to expand our portfolio of services to meet our clients’ needs.
Extending secure network connectivity to any location in the world and any application in the cloud. We operate one of the five largest IP networks in the world, and our global access footprint is one of the broadest in the industry. Network connectivity is a fundamental requirement for clients to realize the full benefits of cloud computing, and they are increasingly demanding dedicated, secure and high-bandwidth connectivity between their various office locations and leading cloud service providers for mission-critical applications and services. We can connect any client location in the world to our global network through our core network infrastructure and relationships with approximately 2,000 regional suppliers. We will continue to seek opportunities to expand our global footprint to enable our clients to connect to the cloud more efficiently and cost-effectively.
Delivering outstanding client experience by living our core values of Simplicity, Speed and Agility. We strive to be easy to work with, fast and responsive, and to say "yes" to our clients. We are committed to delivering high-quality, reliable and secure services that will continue to attract new clients and create additional opportunities with existing clients. We believe that by operating all areas of our business with simplicity, speed and agility, we offer customers a better service experience than larger incumbent providers.
We execute on this strategy both through rep-driven growth and through strategic acquisitions. Our 165 quota bearing reps are focused on designing and delivering world-class global network solutions that connect any office location in the world, to any application in the cloud. We continue to expand our sales force through external hiring and through acquisitions. We have completed many acquisitions throughout our history, and we believe we have consistently demonstrated an ability to acquire and effectively integrate companies and realize cost synergies. Acquisitions have the ability to increase the scale of our operations, which in turn affords us the ability to expand our operating leverage, extend our network reach, augment our product set, and broaden our customer base. We believe our ability to realize significant cost synergies through acquisitions provides us with a competitive advantage in future consolidation opportunities within our industry. We will continue to evaluate these opportunities and are regularly involved

in acquisition discussions. We will evaluate these opportunities based on a number of criteria, including the strategic fit within our existing businesses, the ability to integrate people, systems and networks quickly, and the opportunity to create value through the realization of cost synergies.
Global Network
Our global network assets are deployed in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. Our Tier 1 IP network consists of over 600 points of presence ("PoPs") in top data centers around the world, connected with resilient and redundant transport. Based on industry data, our IP backbone is consistently ranked as a top five network in terms of internet routes. We own and operate three trans-Atlantic subsea cables connecting North America and Europe, including our industry leading lowest latency Express transatlantic subsea cable system. 
Our private, long-haul optical network provides the foundation for a multiprotocol label switching ("MPLS") mesh between core backbone routers in each market. We engineer our network to provide high levels of capacity and performance, even when utilizing enhanced services such as traffic analysis and filtering. We route network traffic to ensure customer applications take the shortest path possible through the network, delivering low latency performance, reliability and security. 
We employ a "capex light" model, which leverages the sophisticated routing and switching infrastructure in our core global network, then integrates network access leased from last mile carriers. This business model benefits us and our customers. We are able to quickly add capacity as needed, minimize infrastructure deployment, maintenance and replacement costs, and focus solely on designing the best network solutions for our clients' specific needs. 
Service Offerings
We deliver the following eight primary service offerings to our customers:
Private Networking 
We provide Layer 2 (Ethernet) and Layer 3 (IP VPN) private networking solutions to meet the growing needs of multinational enterprises, carriers, service providers, and content delivery networks regardless of location. We design and implement custom private, public, and hybrid cloud network solutions for our customers, offering bandwidth speeds from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps per port with burstable and aggregate bandwidth capabilities.

Operations
Supplier Management
We have strong, long-standing relationships with a diverse group of approximately 2,000 suppliers from which we source our global network connectivity, last-mile bandwidth capacity and other services. We maintain multiple supplier agreements covering diverse routes throughout our network to ensure service continuity, competitive pricing, bandwidth capacity and improved carrier responsiveness.
For our core global network, supplier agreements are typically one-year commitments with an option to renew, which enables us to (i) maintain significant flexibility regarding the amount of bandwidth purchased and (ii) consistently benefit from the latest competitive pricing. For last-mile connections, we typically structure the term to match the term of the underlying customer contract.
Our supplier management team continually monitors supplier performance, network information and pricing to provide greater choice, flexibility and cost savings for our customers.
Network Operations
Our network is supported by global Network Operations Centers ("NOCs") located in Austin, Texas; Belfast, Northern Ireland; Dublin, Ireland; Denver, Colorado; Lemont Furnace, Pennsylvania; Pune, India; and Seattle, Washington. The NOCs provide active monitoring, prioritization and resolution of network-related events 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Our NOCs also respond to customer network inquiries, and coordinate and notify customers of maintenance activities.
IT Systems
We provide customers with advanced routing control and visibility into their network performance. Our proprietary online client portal provides customers with online access to monitor their network performance and track real-time statistics.
We have developed a comprehensive Client Management Database ("CMD") that manages our network, customer and supplier contracts, sales quoting, service provisioning, and customer invoicing. CMD also supports our financial reporting and other operational processes as well as our integration of acquired companies. Our CMD system has been in operation since our inception, and its capabilities and processes are continually enhanced and automated. The CMD system provides our management team with visibility into all areas of our operations and allows us to operate with simplicity, speed and agility.
Sales and Marketing
We market our products and services through a global direct sales force and indirect sales channels. We have sales representatives throughout North America, Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. Our sales activities are specifically focused on building relationships with new clients and driving expansion within existing client accounts. Because we typically sell to large, global clients and our markets are highly competitive, we believe that personal relationships and quality of service delivery remain important in winning new and repeat customer business. We supplement our direct sales approach with a trusted community of agents and integrators who already have personal relationships with many leading multinational clients. 
GTT's marketing activities aim to generate broad awareness and promote our value proposition to multinational clients, applying both traditional and digital marketing methods that target key client decision makers.
Customers
Our customer base consists of enterprise, carrier, and government clients around the world. Our multinational enterprise client base includes leading organizations in financial services, healthcare, technology, manufacturing, retail, media and entertainment, and business services. Carrier customers include some of the largest telecommunications firms in the world, who rely on our global network to extend their reach.
Our customer contracts for network services range from one to three years or more for the initial term. Following the initial term, these agreements typically provide for automatic renewal for specified periods ranging from one month to one year. Our prices are fixed for the duration of the contract, and we typically bill monthly in advance for such services. If a customer terminates its agreement, the terms of our customer contracts typically require full recovery of any amounts due for the remainder of the term or, at a minimum, our liability to any underlying suppliers.

Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our competitors include incumbent local exchange carriers, competitive local exchange carriers, internet service providers, cable companies, and other facilities-based operators. Many of these competitors are large, well-capitalized, and have strong market presence, brand recognition, and existing customer relationships. We also face competition from smaller providers who offer network services and managed enterprise solutions similar to ours. Specific competitors vary based on geography, product offering, and vertical market.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to federal, state, and foreign regulations. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications and international telecommunications that originate or terminate in the United States. State Public Utilities Commissions ("PUCs") have similar powers with respect to intrastate telecommunications. Foreign country laws and regulations typically apply to telecommunications that originate or terminate in, or in some instances traverse, that country. The regulation of the telecommunications industry is constantly evolving, and varies from state to state and from country to country.
Where certification, licensing or authorization is required, carriers are required to comply with certain ongoing responsibilities. For example, we are required to submit periodic reports to various telecommunications regulatory authorities relating to the provision of services within relevant jurisdictions. In addition, we are responsible for the payment of certain regulatory fees and the collection and remittance of certain surcharges and fees associated with the provision of telecommunications services depending upon the jurisdiction, the type of service and the type of customer.
Intellectual Property
We do not own any material patent registrations, applications, or licenses.
