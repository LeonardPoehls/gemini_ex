ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview 
 We were incorporated on December 14, 2005 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We are focused on the development of mining technologies for the proficient extraction of precious metals, and our primary objectives are to: (i) commercially and viably extract and refine precious metals from specific coal (fly and bottom) ash and other leachable assets; (ii) use our proprietary processes to convert specific ore bodies and coal ash landfills into valuable assets; and (iii) joint venture, acquire and develop mining projects in North America. 
 We are focusing our business on commercially processing specific coal ash through a process of mechanical attrition, chemical treatments and thermal sintering that exposes extractable gold (the Cholla Process) at our processing and refining plant located in Scottsdale, Arizona (the Scottsdale Facility). This process agglomerates metal atoms into larger nanoparticles, before forming bulk gold metal. Once in bulk gold metal, traditional assay methods can effectively measure value. 
 We are actively seeking to enter into joint ventures with third parties who have legal rights to fly ash resources, including landfills. There is no assurance that we will be able to commercially extract precious metals from fly ash or other mineable ores using our Cholla process or that we will be able to enter into joint ventures for the exploration and development of additional mining projects. 
 Facilities and Technologies 
 Our Scottsdale Facility is an industrial building of approximately 4,550 square feet located in Scottsdale, Arizona. The Scottsdale Facility is designed specifically for processing coal ash using our licensed technology. We have yet to realize significant revenue using our licensed technology. 
Compliance with Government Regulation 
 Our activities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulations in the United States. These statutes regulate the mining of and exploration for mineral properties, and also the possible effects of such activities upon the environment. Future legislation and regulations could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays, the extent of which cannot be predicted.
 Other regulatory requirements monitor the following: 
 
(a) | Explosives and explosives handling. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | Use and occupancy of site structures associated with mining. 
(c) | Hazardous materials and waste disposal. 
(d) | State Historic site preservation.

(e) | Archaeological and paleontological finds associated with mining. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
(f) | Wildlife preservation. 

 The State of Nevada adopted the Mined Land Reclamation Act (the Nevada Act) in 1989 that established design, operation, monitoring and closure requirements for all mining facilities. The Nevada Act has increased the cost of designing, operating, monitoring and closing new mining facilities and could affect the cost of operating, monitoring and closing existing mining facilities. The State of Nevada has also adopted reclamation regulations. The Nevada Act also requires reclamation plans and permits for exploration projects that will result in more than five acres of surface disturbance.
 In the context of environmental permitting, we must comply with known standards, existing laws and regulations that may entail greater or lesser costs and delays, depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and how stringently the regulations are implemented by the permitting authority. We are not presently aware of any specific material environmental constraints affecting our property that would preclude the economic development or operation of any specific property. 
 Competition 
 We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than we do. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for us to develop our mineral properties. 
 We will also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in junior mineral exploration companies. The presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our exploration programs if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on the merit of the mineral properties under investigation and the price of the investment offered to investors. We will also compete with other junior and senior mineral companies for available resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists, camp staff, helicopter or float planes, mineral exploration supplies and drill rigs. 
 Patents and Trademarks 
 We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark.
Research and Development Expenditures 
 During our fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, we spent approximately $291,296 on mineral exploration and evaluation costs. During our fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, we spent approximately $352,771 on mineral exploration and evaluation costs. 

Employees 
 Other than our executive officers, we do not have any employees at the time of this Annual Report.
