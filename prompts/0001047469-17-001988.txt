     Item 1    Business 
  Overview 
         Bioverativ is a global biotechnology company focused on the discovery, research, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of hemophilia and other blood disorders. 
         We market two products, ELOCTATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein] and ALPROLIX [Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein], extended half-life clotting-factor therapies for the treatment of hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively. ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX use a process known as Fc fusion to link recombinant factor VIII and factor IX, respectively, to a protein fragment in the body known as Fc. The fusion of the factor with the Fc protein fragment uses a naturally occurring pathway and is designed to extend the half-life of the factor, thereby making the product last longer in a person's blood than traditional factor therapies. 
         We collaborate with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi) to develop and commercialize ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX globally. Under the collaboration, we have rights to commercialize ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, Latin American countries and all other markets excluding Sobi's commercialization territory. Sobi's commercialization territory includes Europe, Russia and certain countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East. ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX were approved in the United States, Canada and Japan in 2014, and in the European Union in 2015 and 2016, respectively. 
         We have multiple programs intended to further support our marketed products and an innovative product pipeline devoted to the creation and delivery of new therapies:
 

 Research activities relating to our marketed products include ongoing and planned post-marketing studies exploring the potential of Fc fusion
technology on long-term joint health, immunogenicity and immune tolerance induction in hemophilia patients who develop inhibitors. 
 Research activities relating to new products include discovery and preclinical programs studying longer-acting extended half-life hemophilia
product candidates, non-factor products to treat hemophilia (such as bi-specific antibody technology) and gene therapies for both hemophilia A and B. We also have ongoing research programs relating to
sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. 

 Separation from Biogen 
         Bioverativ Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed on August 4, 2016 to hold the hemophilia business of Biogen. Bioverativ separated from Biogen on February 1, 2017 as a result of a special dividend distribution of all the outstanding shares of common stock of Bioverativ to Biogen stockholders. The distribution was made to Biogen stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 17, 2017, who received one share of Bioverativ common stock for every two shares of Biogen common stock held as of such date. As a result of the distribution, Bioverativ is now an independent public company whose shares of common stock are trading under the symbol "BIVV" on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 
 Hemophilia A and B 
         Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are rare, x-linked genetic disorders that impair the ability of a person's blood to clot due to reduced levels of a protein known as factor VIII or factor IX, respectively. This impairment can lead to recurrent and extended bleeding episodes that may cause pain, irreversible joint damage and life-threatening hemorrhages. In its Annual Global Survey 2015, the 
 6

   World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) estimated that over 151,000 people worldwide were identified as living with hemophilia A and nearly 30,000 people were diagnosed with hemophilia B. 
         Hemophilia is usually diagnosed at birth or at a very young age, and predominantly affects males. An individual's hemophilia is classified as mild, moderate or severe and is based on the level of factor activity in the blood. Although hemophilia care varies widely across the globe, in the United States a majority of patients receive care from specialized hemophilia treatment centers. 
         Hemophilia is treated by injecting the missing clotting factor directly into the patient's bloodstream. Therapies can be administered either on a schedule to help prevent or reduce bleeding episodes (prophylaxis) or to control bleeding when it occurs (on-demand). Over time, regimens have shifted from on-demand treatment to routine prophylaxis due to observed improvements in long-term clinical outcomes, such as joint damage. In the United States, the February 2016 guidelines of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the National Hemophilia Foundation recommend routine prophylaxis as optimal for the treatment of people with severe hemophilia. 
         Historically, hemophilia treatments were derived from factors taken from human blood plasma. In the early 1990's, recombinant factor products, developed in a lab through the use of recombinant DNA technology, became available. In 2016, use of recombinant factor product accounted for over 75% of sales globally. In 2014, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX became the first available extended half-life recombinant factor therapies in the United States with the benefit of an effective treatment even with less frequent, more convenient dosing requirements. 
         Patients may experience complications with factor therapies. In some cases, patients may develop inhibitors that recognize the infused factor as a foreign protein and create antibodies to it. Inhibitor antibodies occur when a person with hemophilia has an immune response to treatment with clotting factor concentrates. According to the WFH, an inhibitor usually occurs within the first 75 exposures to factor concentrates and thus is most often seen in children with severe hemophilia. In 2014, the WFH estimated that approximately 25% to 30% of children with severe hemophilia A and approximately 1% to 6% of individuals with hemophilia B will develop inhibitors. A common treatment to eradicate inhibitors is immune tolerance induction. Immune tolerance induction involves exposure to frequent and higher doses of recombinant factor until the body can tolerate the factor. While this treatment can be effective, the treatment burden is high as it can take months or even years for the inhibitor antibodies to be removed. 
   Our Marketed Products 
         Our marketed products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, leverage expertise in Fc fusion technology that was originally acquired by Biogen from Syntonix Pharmaceuticals (Syntonix, and now known as Bioverativ Therapeutics Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary) in 2007. Fc fusion is a proprietary technology used to link recombinant factor VIII and factor IX in the case of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, respectively, to a protein fragment in the body known as Fc. The fusion with Fc uses a naturally occurring pathway and is designed to extend the half-life of the factor, thereby making the product last longer in a patient's blood than traditional factor therapies. ELOCTATE consists of the 
 7

   Coagulation Factor VIII molecule (historically known as Antihemophilic Factor) linked to Fc and ALPROLIX consists of the Coagulation Factor IX molecule linked to Fc. 

   
Product | General Description 
 | ELOCTATE is approved in the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, Brazil, the European Union and certain other countries for the treatment of adults and children with hemophilia A to control and prevent bleeding episodes. In the United States, it is indicated for use in adults and children with hemophilia A for on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes, perioperative management of bleeding and routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes. ELOCTATE has received orphan designation in the United States. 
 | Bioverativ's principal markets for ELOCTATE currently include the United States, Japan and Canada. Sobi began commercializing ELOCTA (the approved tradename for ELOCTATE in the European Union) in some European countries in 2016. 
 | ALPROLIX is approved in the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, Brazil, the European Union and certain other countries for the treatment of adults and children with hemophilia B to control and prevent bleeding episodes. In the United States, it is indicated for use in adults and children with hemophilia B for control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative management and routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes. ALPROLIX has received orphan designation in the United States and the European Union.
 | Bioverativ's principal markets for ALPROLIX currently include the United States, Japan and Canada. Sobi began commercializing ALPROLIX in some European countries in 2016 following its approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in May 2016. 


        Through a development and commercialization agreement with Sobi, we have rights to commercialize ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia and all other markets excluding Sobi's commercialization territory. Sobi's commercialization territory for these therapies is Europe, Russia and certain countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East. For a further description of our development and collaboration agreement with Sobi, see "Our Development and Commercialization Arrangements with Sobi" below. 
         Product sales for ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX each accounted for approximately 58% and 38%, respectively of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 57% and 42%, respectively of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and approximately 43% and 57%, respectively of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.

    Condition and Results of Operations included in this report. A discussion of the risks attendant to our global operations is set forth in this report under Item 1A.  Risk Factors. 
   Pipeline and Research and Development Activities 
         Our research activities relating to ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX include ongoing and planned post-marketing studies exploring the potential impact of the Fc fusion technology on long-term joint health, immunogenicity and immune tolerance induction in hemophilia patients who develop inhibitors. 
         In addition to work relating to our current marketed products, we are also engaged in discovery and preclinical programs focused on advancing new technologies for the treatment of hemophilia and other blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. Our scientific and medical leaders plan to renew focus on advancing discovery work with small molecules and cell and gene therapy in the hopes of developing treatments for this disease. For a period of time following the separation, Biogen will provide us with technical services related to our pipeline and research and development activities. A brief description of our most advanced programs, together with certain related business relationships and collaborations, is described below. 
  BIVV 001(rFVIIIFc-VWF-XTEN).    A preclinical program of the combination of factor VIII-Fc fusion protein with part of Von Willebrand factors, another component of the clotting cascade attached with proprietary XTEN technology licensed from Amunix Operating Inc. (Amunix). The product candidate is being developed with the objective of achieving once weekly or less frequent dosing by intravenous administration in patients with hemophilia A. 
  BIVV 002 (rFIXFc-XTEN).    A preclinical program for a next generation recombinant factor IX replacement product using XTEN technology exploring the use of subcutaneous dosing for patients with hemophilia B with the objective of achieving once weekly or less frequent dosing, which we believe would simplify the administration process for patients with hemophilia B. 
         Gene Therapy Programs.    We are collaborating with Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele S.r.l. to develop gene therapies for hemophilia A and B. This collaboration centers on advanced lentiviral gene transfer technology of the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy. 
  Bi-Specific Antibody Program.    A preclinical program to develop a non-factor bi-specific antibody for the treatment of patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors and the general hemophilia A population. 
         Other Blood Disorders.    We are currently pursuing opportunities in sickle cell disease, including carrying out small molecule screens against targets that we believe have potential to intervene in sickle cell disease as well as performing clinical research in an effort to develop better measures of efficacy. In addition, we have an exclusive, worldwide research, development and commercialization collaboration and license agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (Sangamo) under which we are working to develop and commercialize product candidates using genome editing technologies for the treatment of two inherited blood disorders, sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. For more information on our collaboration with Sangamo, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis and Results of OperationsYears Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014Contractual ObligationsFunding CommitmentsSangamo Therapeutics, Inc. 
         Our expenses for research and development activities were $178.8 million in 2016, $186.1 million in 2015 and $239.8 million in 2014. These expenses include costs associated with research and development activities performed while part of Biogen, collaboration payments and expenses primarily to Sobi, salaries and related expenses for personnel, license fees, consulting payments, contract research, clinical trial costs, manufacturing and the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities. In addition these expenses include allocations from Biogen to us for depreciation and other facility-based 
 9

   expenses, regulatory affairs function, pharmacovigilance, other infrastructure and management costs supporting multiple projects. As a result, these expenses are not necessarily indicative of Bioverativ's expenses for research and development activities as a standalone company. 
         Investment in research and development is critical to our future growth and our ability to remain competitive in the markets in which we participate. We intend to continue to make significant investment in research and development programs in addition to seeking to enhance future growth through internal efforts, acquisitions and collaborations with third parties. 
   Our Development and Commercialization Arrangements with Sobi 
         Bioverativ Therapeutics Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, is a party to a development and commercialization agreement with Sobi, under which it has agreed to develop and commercialize in defined territories ELOCTATE, ALPROLIX and certain compound constructs that Sobi elects to designate as subject to the parties' collaboration. Generally, these compound constructs include fusion proteins containing both a recombinant factor and the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin, including certain constructs that may be developed using technology we license from Amunix. 
         The development and commercialization agreement generally defines Bioverativ's commercialization territory as the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, Brazil and all other markets excluding Sobi's commercialization territory, and Sobi's commercialization territory as Europe, Russia and certain countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East. 
         Under the development and commercialization agreement, prior to May 5, 2024, either Bioverativ or Sobi may present a compound construct as a potential product candidate that the parties may consider developing and commercializing under the collaboration. Upon Sobi's election to treat a compound construct as a product, and in the case of a novel compound construct Sobi's payment of an upfront fee to us, Sobi is granted the right to opt-in to such compound construct and become responsible for final development and commercialization of that compound construct in Sobi's commercialization territory. Generally, upon opt-in, Sobi becomes obligated to make an advance payment and reimburse Bioverativ for certain development expenses incurred with respect to the compound construct. Until Sobi's portion of the development expenses are fully paid, Sobi's royalty rate payable to Bioverativ is increased, and the royalty payment payable by Bioverativ to Sobi for the sale of products in Bioverativ's territory is decreased. 
         The development and commercialization agreement provides for royalty payments between the parties for sales of collaboration products, including ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, that vary based upon, among other things, the territory in which the sale was made and how the product is commercialized. 
 10

           The following is a summary of the royalty rates between the parties: 

   
 | | | | Rates post Sobi Opt-In(3) 
Royalty and Net Revenue Share Rates(1) | Method | Rate prior to 1st commercial sale in the Sobi Territory | | Base Rate following 1st commercial sale in the Sobi Territory | Rate during the Reimbursement Period | 
Sobi rate to Bioverativ on net sales in the Sobi Territory | Royalty | | N/A | | 12 | % | 17 | %
Bioverativ rate to Sobi on net sales in the Bioverativ North America Territory | Royalty | | 2 | % | 12 | % | 7 | %
Bioverativ rate to Sobi on net sales in the Bioverativ Direct Territory | Royalty | | 2 | % | 17 | % | 12 | %
Bioverativ rate to Sobi on net revenue(2) from the Bioverativ Distributor Territory | Net Revenue Share | | 10 | % | 50 | % | 35 | %


  (1)
For purposes of this table, the "Sobi Territory" means territories in which Sobi has commercial rights, meaning Europe, Russia and certain countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East; the "Bioverativ North America Territory" means territories in North America in which Bioverativ has commercial rights; the "Bioverativ Direct Territory" means territories in which Bioverativ has commercial rights other than the Sobi Territory and the Bioverativ North America Territory; and the "Bioverativ Distributor Territory" means Bioverativ territories where sales are derived by Bioverativ utilizing a third party distributor. 
(2)
Net revenue represents Bioverativ's pre-tax receipts from third party distributors, less expenses incurred by Bioverativ in the conduct of commercialization activities supporting the distributor activities. 
(3)
A credit will be issued to Sobi against its reimbursement of the Opt-in Consideration in an amount equal to the difference in the rate paid by Bioverativ to Sobi on sales in the Bioverativ territories for certain periods prior to the first commercial sale in the Sobi Territory versus the rate that otherwise would have been payable on such sales. The first commercial sale of ELOCTA and ALPROLIX in the Sobi Territory occurred in January 2016 and June 2016, respectively. 


        Upon Sobi's first commercial sale in 2016, and during the Reimbursement period, the cash royalty rate the company will pay Sobi on sales of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in our territory is 7%. After the Reimbursement period concludes, the cash royalty rate we pay to Sobi increases to 12%. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the expected term of the agreement, we are recording cost of sales at the effective royalty rate of approximately 11%. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the royalty payable to Sobi based upon sales in the company's territory was 2%. 
         The royalty rate received by the company, during the Reimbursement period on sales of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in Sobi's territory is 17%. After the Reimbursement period concludes, the royalty we receive decreases to 12%. We are recording revenue at the effective royalty rate expected over the term of the agreement of approximately 14%. 
         The development and commercialization agreement is terminable in its entirety or with respect to a product developed under the collaboration by either party upon six months' written notice. The agreement is also terminable in its entirety under certain conditions and subject to certain dispute resolution procedures following a party's uncured material breach of a material obligation of the agreement. Unless earlier terminated, the duration of the agreement continues with respect to each product, for so long as such product is being sold anywhere in the world.

           In September 2014, Sobi elected to treat BIVV 001 (rFVIIIFc-VWF-XTEN), a preclinical compound construct developed using the XTEN technology licensed by Bioverativ from Amunix, as subject to the collaboration. 
         In November 2014, Sobi exercised its option to assume final development and commercialization activities in Sobi's commercialization territory for ELOCTA, the approved trade name for ELOCTATE in the European Union. ELOCTA was approved by the European Commission (EC) in November 2015, and Sobi had its first commercial sales in January 2016. In March 2016, the EC approved the transfer of the marketing authorization for ELOCTA to Sobi, making Sobi the marketing authorization holder of ELOCTA in the European Union. As the marketing authorization holder, Sobi has legal responsibility for ELOCTA, from a regulatory perspective, during its entire life cycle in the European Union. The opt-in consideration and aggregate amount reimbursable by Sobi to us for ELOCTA was $211.1 million. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $143.9 million remained reimbursable to us by Sobi. 
         In July 2015, Sobi exercised its option to assume final development and commercialization activities in the Sobi territory for ALPROLIX. ALPROLIX was approved by the EC in May 2016. In October 2016, the EC approved the transfer of the marketing authorization for ALPROLIX to Sobi, making Sobi the marketing authorization holder of ALPROLIX in the European Union. As the marketing authorization holder, Sobi has legal responsibility for ALPROLIX, from a regulatory perspective, during its entire life cycle in the European Union. The opt-in consideration and aggregate amount reimbursable by Sobi to us for ALPROLIX was $184.7 million. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $122.6 million remained reimbursable to us by Sobi. 
         In February 2017, Sobi elected to treat BIVV 002 (rFIXFc-XTEN), a preclinical compound construct developed using the XTEN technology licensed by Bioverativ from Amunix, as subject to the collaboration. In consideration for its election, Sobi will pay us $6.2 million. 
         Pursuant to the development and commercialization agreement, Bioverativ and Sobi are also parties to ancillary agreements, including manufacturing and supply agreements for ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX pursuant to which Sobi forecasts, orders and purchases drug substance and drug product that is supplied to Sobi by Bioverativ. We expect to satisfy our supply obligations to Sobi by obtaining ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX drug substance and drug product through Bioverativ's manufacturing and supply arrangements with Biogen as well as other third party contract manufacturing organizations. See "Manufacturing and Facilities" below. 
         For more information on our collaboration with Sobi, see Note 3, Collaborations, to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
   Our International Operations 
         We anticipate that, in addition to the United States and Canada, Japan will remain a significant focus for growing patient share of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in the near term. We have conducted research and development activities for hemophilia treatments in Japan since 2010. Through our dedicated Japanese sales force and marketing team, we have sold ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in Japan since receipt of marketing approval in December 2014 and June 2014, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenue of approximately $133.4 million outside of the United States, from our sales of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in Japan and Canada. 
 Intellectual Property 
         We rely on patents and other proprietary rights to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We own a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and have entered into license arrangements relating to various third party patents and technologies. 
 12

     Patents 
         Patents are important to obtaining and protecting exclusivity in our products and product candidates. We regularly seek patent protection in the U.S. and in selected countries outside of the U.S. for inventions originating from our research and development efforts. In addition, we license rights from others to various patents and patent applications. 
         U.S. patents, as well as most non-U.S. patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest application was filed; however, U.S. patents that issue on applications filed before June 8, 1995 may be effective until 17 years from the issue date, if that is later than the 20 year date. In some cases, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic, and in the case of the United States, also because of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) delays in prosecuting the application. Specifically, in the U.S., under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, a patent that covers a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension (for up to five years, but not beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process, but only one patent per approved drug product may be so extended. The duration and extension of the term of foreign patents varies, in accordance with local law. 
         Our patent portfolio includes issued patents and pending applications relating to our marketed products and our product pipeline. We hold patents for ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX that cover the composition of matter and methods of treatment of those therapies. Patents of primary importance to ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX have issued in the United States, Europe and Japan, and based on the applicable patent statutes and in the ordinary course, generally expire between 2024 and 2032. We also continue to pursue additional patents and patent term extensions in the United States and other territories covering various aspects of our products that may, if issued, extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of these patents. 
         The existence of patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Patents relating to biopharmaceutical and biotechnology products, compounds and processes, such as those that cover our existing compounds, products and processes and those that we will likely file in the future, do not always provide complete or adequate protection. Our patents may be invalidated earlier based on a competitor's challenge in an applicable patent office or court proceeding. 
   Regulatory Exclusivity 
         In addition to patent protection, certain of our products are entitled to regulatory exclusivity which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection. The expected expiration of this regulatory exclusivity in the United States and the European Union is set forth below: 

Product | Territory | Expected Expiration | 
ELOCTATE | United States | | 2026 | 
ELOCTA(1) | European Union | | 2025 | 
ALPROLIX | United States | | 2026 | 
ALPROLIX(1) | European Union | | 2026 | (2)


  (1)
Sobi has assumed responsibility for commercializing ELOCTA and ALPROLIX in Sobi's commercialization territory pursuant to our development and commercialization agreement with Sobi. 


13

     (2)
This date has the potential to be extended by two years subject to EMA review and certification of activities conducted under our pediatric investigational plan. 


        Regulatory data protection provides to the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization, for a set period of time, the exclusive use of the proprietary preclinical and clinical data that it created at significant cost and submitted to the applicable regulatory authority to obtain approval of its product. After the applicable set period of time, third parties are then permitted to rely upon our data to file for approval of their abbreviated applications for, and to market (subject to any applicable market protection), their generic drugs and biosimilars referencing our data. Market protection provides to the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization the exclusive right to commercialize its product for a set period of time, thereby preventing the commercialization of another product containing the same active ingredient(s) during that period. Although the World Trade Organization's agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights requires signatory countries to provide regulatory exclusivity to innovative pharmaceutical products, implementation and enforcement varies widely from country to country. In the United States, biologics, such as ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, are entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). PPACA provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Under this framework, FDA cannot make a product approval effective for any biosimilar application until at least 12 years after the reference product's date of first licensure. The PPACA also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar. The PPACA does not, however, change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. 
         Japan also provides for market exclusivity through a re-examination system, which prevents the entry of generics and biosimilars until the end of the re-examination period (REP), which can be up to eight years from marketing approval. ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX are expected to have REPs ending in 2022. 
   Other Proprietary Rights 
         We also rely upon other forms of unpatented confidential information to remain competitive. We protect such information principally through confidentiality and non-use agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and scientists whose research we sponsor and other advisers. In the case of our employees, these agreements also provide, in compliance with relevant law, that inventions and other intellectual property conceived by such employees during their employment shall be our exclusive property. 
         Our trademarks are important to us and are generally covered by trademark applications or registrations in the USPTO and the patent or trademark offices of other countries. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used and in other countries as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms. 
         Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by others to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We may also face challenges to our patents, regulatory exclusivities and other proprietary rights covering our products by manufacturers of generic drugs and biosimilars. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position, regulatory exclusivities and other proprietary rights is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

  Manufacturing and Facilities 
         ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX are currently manufactured at Biogen-owned facilities located in North Carolina. The manufacturing process for bulk drug substance includes protein production, purification and viral clearance. Manufacture and supply of drug product, which includes fill finish, labeling and packaging, are provided primarily through third party contract manufacturing organizations. 
         In connection with our separation from Biogen, we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Biogen for hemophilia products, pursuant to which Biogen will manufacture and supply, exclusively for us, drug substance, drug product and finished goods with respect to ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, as well as for certain of our pipeline product candidates. Fill finish, label and packaging, distribution and logistics services for ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX drug product are initially being provided by Biogen directly or through third party contract manufacturing organizations. We anticipate increasing our level of direct contractual responsibility with third party contract manufacturing organizations, logistics providers and distributors as we scale up our internal supply management capabilities. For additional information regarding manufacturing services, see the discussion of the manufacturing and supply and transition services arrangements entered into between Biogen and Bioverativ in Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Person TransactionsAgreements with Biogen. 
         Our properties include facilities which, in our opinion, are suitable and adequate for development and distribution of our products. For additional information regarding our properties, see Item 2. Properties. 
 Raw Materials 
         We rely on Biogen for all supplies and raw materials used in the production of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX drug substance. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect the availability of sufficient quantities of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
         We have our own direct sales force. Our products are distributed to and through specialty pharmacies, hemophilia treatment centers, public and private hospitals and independent distributors. In the United States, our two largest customers are CVS Health Corporation and Accredo Health Incorporated each accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our sales, particularly to specialty pharmacies and hemophilia treatment centers, are subject to discounted pricing. See "Regulatory MattersPricing and Reimbursement" below. We review our sales channels from time to time, and will make changes in our sales and distribution model as we believe necessary to best implement our business plan and strategies. 
         We are relying on Biogen for a period of time to supply and distribute our products to customers while we obtain appropriate regulatory authorizations in certain countries, including the United States and Canada. In the United States, we are in the process of securing a Department of Health and Human Services United States License Number, certain state authorizations and other regulatory and government authorizations. In Canada, we are in the process of applying for additional licenses, including a Drug Establishment License from Health Canada. We anticipate these interim arrangements to be in place through no later than the fourth quarter of 2017. 
         In the United States and Canada, third parties warehouse and ship our products through their distribution centers. These centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service. Sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales and customer service 
 15

   representatives, automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems, circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins, direct-mail campaigns, trade publication presence and advertising. 
         Our Japanese sales and product distributions are made on a direct basis. We use and expect to continue to use a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize our products outside of the United States. Under our development and commercialization arrangement with Sobi, for example, Sobi has assumed responsibility for commercializing ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in its territory. See "Our Development and Commercialization Arrangements with Sobi" above. 
   Competition 
         We face substantial competition from biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and other companies of all sizes, in the United States and other countries, as such competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels. Many of our competitors are working to develop products similar to those we are developing or those that we already market. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product effectiveness and quality, patient convenience and technological innovation, such as longer-acting, extended half-life therapies for hemophilia. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can impact our products. 
         The principal sources of competition for Bioverativ's products globally are as follows:
 

 ELOCTATE: ELOCTATE competes with recombinant Factor VIII products including: 


 ADVATE® (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant))Shire 
 ADYNOVATE (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), PEGylated)Shire 
 AFSTYLA ® [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) Single Chain]CSL Behring 
 HELIXATE® FS (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant))CSL Behring 
 KOGENATE® FS (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant))Bayer 
 KOVALTRY® Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)Bayer 
 NovoEight® (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant))Novo Nordisk 
 Nuwiq® Recombinant Factor VIIIOctapharma. 
 RECOMBINATE (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant))Shire 
 XYNTHA®/ReFacto AF® (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free)Pfizer and Sobi 

 ALPROLIX: competes with recombinant Factor IX products including: 


 BENEFIX® (Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant))Pfizer 
 IDELVION® (Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Albumin Fusion Protein)CSL Behring 
 IXINITY® (Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant))Aptevo (a spin-off from Emergent Biosolutions completed in
August 2016) 
 RIXUBIS® (Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant))Shire 


         Our products also compete with a number of plasma derived Factor VIII and IX products. We are also aware of other longer-acting products and new technologies, such as gene therapies and bi-specific antibodies that are in development and, if successfully developed and approved, would compete with 
 16

   our hemophilia products. New therapies and technologies have the potential to transform the standard of care for hemophilia patients, and our products may be unable to compete successfully with such new therapies and technologies that may be developed and marketed by other companies. 
         There are additional competitive products or alternative therapy regimens available on a more limited geographic basis throughout the world. 
         For additional information regarding competition, see the discussion of such matters in Item 1A. Risk Factors, including the following: "Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our BusinessIf our hemophilia products fail to compete effectively, our business and market position would suffer." 
   Regulatory Matters 
         Our operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, both within and outside of the United States. The FDA, the EMA, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan (the MHLW) and other government agencies both inside and outside of the United States, regulate the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, distribution and post-market surveillance of our products. We must obtain specific approval from the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities before we can market and sell most of our products in a particular country. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. 
 Clinical Trial and Approval Process 
         The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies promulgate regulations and standards for designing, conducting, monitoring, auditing and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are accurate and that the rights and welfare of trial participants are adequately protected commonly referred to as current good clinical practices (cGCPs). Regulatory agencies enforce cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites, contract research organizations (CROs), and institutional review boards. If studies fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated may be deemed unreliable and relevant regulatory agencies may conduct additional audits or require additional clinical trials before approving a marketing application. Noncompliance can also result in civil or criminal sanctions. We rely on third parties, including CROs, to carry out many of our clinical trial-related activities. Failure of such third parties to comply with cGCPs can likewise result in rejection of our clinical trial data or other sanctions. 
         Before new biologic products may be sold in the United States, preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must be conducted and the results submitted to the FDA for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA requires companies to register both pre-approval and post-approval clinical trials and disclose clinical trial results in public databases. Failure to register a trial or disclose study results within the required time periods could result in penalties, including civil monetary penalties. To support marketing approval, clinical trial programs must establish a candidate product's efficacy, determine an appropriate dose and dosing regimen and define the conditions for safe use. This is a high-risk process that requires stepwise clinical studies, usually conducted in three phases, in which the candidate product must successfully meet predetermined endpoints. The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a product are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application (BLA). In response to a BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. 
         Product development and receipt of regulatory approval takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, potential safety signals observed in preclinical or clinical tests and the risks and benefits of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials. 
 17

   Many research and development programs do not result in the commercialization of a product. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process, and it is impossible to predict with any certainty whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval, or whether an approval, if granted, will be subject to limitations based on the FDA's interpretation of the relevant pre-clinical or clinical data. The agency also may require the sponsor of a BLA to conduct additional clinical studies or to provide other scientific or technical information about the product, and these additional requirements may lead to unanticipated delay or expense. 
         Most non-U.S. jurisdictions have product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the United States. In Europe, for example, there are several tracks for marketing approval, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure in Europe, a company submits a single application to the EMA that is similar to the BLA in the United States. A marketing application approved by the EC is valid in all member states. In addition to the centralized procedure, Europe also has various other methods for submitting applications and receiving approvals. Regardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection and evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national authorities, the EMA, the EC and the marketing authorization holder. In some regions, it is possible to receive an "accelerated" review whereby the national regulatory authority will commit to truncated review timelines for products that meet specific medical needs. 
         Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biologics intended to treat a "rare disease or condition," which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity. This means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years following marketing approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product. Legislation similar to the U.S. Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries to encourage the research, development and marketing of medicines to treat, prevent or diagnose rare diseases. In the European Union, medicinal products intended for diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or very serious diseases affecting less than five in 10,000 people receive 10-year market exclusivity, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized procedure for marketing authorization. ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX have each received an orphan drug designation in the United States and have received orphan exclusivity through June 2021 and March 2021, respectively. ALPROLIX has also received an orphan drug designation in the European Union. 
         Biologic products may be subject to increased competition from biosimilar formulations of reference biologic products in the future. The complex nature of biologic products has warranted the creation of biosimilar regulatory approval pathways with strict, science-based approval standards that take into account patient safety considerations. These biosimilar approval pathways are considered to be more abbreviated than for new biologics, although they are significantly different from the abbreviated approval pathways available for "generic drugs" (small-molecule drugs that are the same as, and bioequivalent to, an already-approved small molecule drug). The European Union has created a pathway for the approval of biosimilars, and has published guidance for approval of certain biosimilar products. More recently, in 2010, the PPACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars, but only a small number of biosimilars have been approved by the FDA to date and the U.S. approval pathway for biosimilars remains subject to ongoing guidance from the FDA. While mature pathways for regulatory approval of generic drugs and healthcare systems exist around the globe that support and promote the substitutability of generic drugs, the approval pathways for biosimilar products remain in various stages of development, as do private and public initiatives or actions supporting the substitutability of biosimilar products. Thus, the extent to which biosimilars will be viewed as readily 
 18

   substitutable, and in practice readily substituted, for the reference biologic product is largely yet to be determined. 
   Post-Approval Requirements 
         The FDA may require a sponsor to conduct additional post-marketing studies as a condition of approval to provide data on safety and effectiveness. If a sponsor fails to conduct the required studies, the agency may withdraw its approval. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a product that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it can mandate post-marketing restrictions as necessary to assure safe use. These may include requiring the sponsor to establish rigorous systems, such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS), to assure use of the product under safe conditions. The FDA can impose financial penalties for failing to comply with certain post-marketing commitments, including REMS. In addition, any changes to approved REMS must be reviewed and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. 
         Changes to approved products, such as adding an indication, making certain manufacturing changes, or changing manufacturers or suppliers of certain ingredients or components, may be subject to rigorous review, including multiple regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. For example, to obtain a new indication, a company must demonstrate with additional clinical data that the product is safe and effective for the new use. FDA regulatory review may result in denial or modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes. 
         Even after a company obtains regulatory approval to market a product, the product and the company's manufacturing processes and quality systems are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. We and our contract manufacturers also must adhere to current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) and product-specific regulations enforced by regulatory agencies both before and after product approval. Regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of biologic products prior to approving a product, as well as periodically following the initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities or processes or that of our manufacturers do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, we may face civil, criminal or administrative sanctions or remedies, including significant financial penalties and the suspension of our manufacturing operations. 
         Manufacturers are also required to monitor information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval and report such information and events to regulatory agencies. Non-compliance with the FDA's safety reporting requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Based on new safety information that emerges after approval, the FDA can mandate product labeling changes, impose a new REMS or the addition of elements to an existing REMS, require new post-marketing studies (including additional clinical trials) or suspend or withdraw approval of the product. These requirements may affect a company's ability to maintain marketing approval of its products or require a company to make significant expenditures to obtain or maintain such approvals. 
   Pricing and Reimbursement 
         In both U.S. and non-U.S. markets, sales of our products depend, in part, on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third party payors, including governments, private health plans and other organizations. Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the coverage, pricing and reimbursement of our products. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and pricing of our products to control healthcare cost or affect utilization of the products. The U.S. and non-U.S. governments have enacted 
 19

   and regularly consider additional reform measures that affect health care and drug coverage and costs. Private health plans may also seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. Other payors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, government health administration authorities and private health insurers, seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived value. 
   Within the United States 
 

Medicaid:  Medicaid is a joint federal and state
program that is administered by the states for low-income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the
state Medicaid programs. For most brand name drugs, the amount of the basic rebate for each product is set by law as 17.1% for clotting factors and certain other products of the average manufacturer
price (AMP) or the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any customer (with limited exceptions). The rebate amount must be adjusted upward if AMP increases more than inflation
(measured by the Consumer Price IndexUrban). This adjustment can cause the total rebate amount to exceed the minimum 17.1% basic rebate amount. The rebate amount is calculated each
quarter based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The requirements for calculating AMP and best price are
complex. We are required to report any revisions to AMP or best price previously reported within a certain period, which revisions could affect our rebate liability for prior quarters. In addition, if
we fail to provide information timely or are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program provides for civil monetary
penalties. 
Medicare:  Medicare is a federal program that is
administered by the federal government and covers individuals age 65 and over, as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that must be administered by
physicians or other health care practitioners; are provided in connection with certain durable medical equipment; or certain oral anti-cancer drugs and certain oral immunosuppressive drugs. Clotting
factors for hemophilia are typically paid under Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price (ASP) of the drugs.
Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide ASP information to the CMS on a quarterly basis. The manufacturer-submitted information is used to calculate Medicare payment rates. For drugs
administered outside the hospital outpatient setting, the current payment rate for Medicare Part B drugs is ASP plus six percent (4.3% after sequestration). The payment rates for drugs
in the hospital outpatient setting are subject to periodic adjustment. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, the governing statute provides for civil
monetary penalties. 

Medicare
Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that are not administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered
by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug
plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. In addition,
manufacturers, including us, are required to provide to CMS a 50% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage
gap in their drug benefits. 


 20

   

Federal Agency Discounted Pricing:  Our products are
subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). FSS participation is required for our products to be covered and reimbursed by the Veterans
Administration (VA), Department of Defense, Coast Guard and the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS). Coverage under Medicaid, Medicare and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is also conditioned upon
FSS participation. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that we charge our most-favored non-federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the VA, Department of
Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TriCare retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76% of the
non-federal average manufacturer price (non-FAMP). An additional discount applies if non-FAMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price IndexUrban). In addition, if we
fail to provide information timely or are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties. 
340B Discounted Pricing:  To maintain coverage of
our products under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, we are required to extend significant discounts to certain covered entities that purchase products under
Section 340B of the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health
clinics, hemophilia treatment centers and other entities that receive certain types of grants under the Public Health Service Act. For all of our products, we must agree to charge a price that will
not exceed the amount determined under statute (the "ceiling price") when we sell outpatient drugs to these covered entities. In addition, we may, but are not required to, offer these covered entities
a price lower than the 340B ceiling price. The 340B discount formula is based on AMP and is generally similar to the level of rebates calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. 

   Outside of the United States 
         Within the European Union, products sold by Sobi are paid for by a variety of payors, with governments being the primary source of payment. Governments may determine or influence reimbursement of products. Governments may also set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization of our products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, "value-based pricing" and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). Budgetary pressures in many countries in the European Union are continuing to cause governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates and expanded generic substitution and patient cost-sharing. 
   Japanese Regulatory Matters 
         In Japan, the MHLW is responsible for regulating biological and pharmaceutical products under the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Law, which provides a regulatory framework similar to that of the United States. Specifically, with regard to the clinical trial and approval process, before a new biological product may be sold in Japan, clinical trials must be conducted for the product of which the MHLW and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), a governmental organization authorized by the MHLW, must be notified. For the product to be approved, the results of such clinical trials must then be submitted to the PMDA. Approved products are subject to regulatory requirements similar to those of the United States, including (i) the possibility of the MHLW requiring post-marketing studies to gather data on a product's safety and efficacy as a condition for approval, (ii) re-examination of the approved product within a specific time period following approval 
 21

   (e.g., 8 years for a new product) to verify its safety and efficacy and (iii) the reporting of any adverse event to the PMDA. With regard to pricing and reimbursement, Japan has a single health insurance system (National Health Insurance), under which drugs are provided to patients at a price designated by the MHLW in its discretion after negotiations between the applicable biopharmaceutical company and the MHLW under the National Health Insurance Act. 
   Other Laws 
         We and our products are also subject to various other regulatory regimes both inside and outside of the United States. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to data privacy and protection, safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. In the United States alone, we are subject to the oversight of the FDA, the Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services, the CMS, the Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Defense and Customs and Border Protection, in addition to others. In jurisdictions outside of the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by government agencies including the EMA in Europe, and other agencies in other jurisdictions. Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare companies in recent years. These actions appear to be part of a general trend toward increased enforcement activity globally. In addition, certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights may be subject to national or international antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted. 
 Patient Engagement, Patient Access and Humanitarian Aid 
         We interact with patients, advocacy organizations and healthcare societies in order to gain insights into unmet needs in the hemophilia treatment community. The insights gained from these engagements help develop services, programs and applications that are designed to help patients lead better lives. 
         We are dedicated to helping patients obtain access to our therapies. For example, we provide charitable contributions that may assist eligible patients to receive our products. We plan to continue our commitment, together with Sobi, to donate up to one billion international units (IUs) of clotting factor therapy for humanitarian use, of which up to 500 million IUs will be donated to the WFH over a period of five years. We will be responsible for half of the committed donation. In 2015, the first shipments of hemophilia therapy were made to the WFH. 
   Employees 
         We employ approximately 350 persons as of February 28, 2017. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. 
   Environmental Matters 
         Our environmental policies require compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate, among other things, appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection. While it is impossible to predict accurately the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities, compliance with environmental laws is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our operations or competitive position.

We include our website address in this report only as an inactive textual reference and do not intend it to be an active link to our website. The contents of our website are not incorporated into this report. 
      Item 1A    Risk Factors 
        You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this report in evaluating Bioverativ and Bioverativ's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and could adversely impact, or result in volatility to, our stock price following the distribution. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to our business, risks related to the separation from Biogen and risks related to our common stock.
 Risks Related to Our Business 
   We are dependent on revenues from our products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. If we or Sobi are unable to successfully commercialize ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX, our results of operations would be materially harmed. 
         Net sales of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX represent substantially all of our revenues, and this concentration makes us dependent on these two products. Further, we currently have limited resources for commercializing ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX outside of the United States, Japan and Canada, and are dependent on the efforts of Sobi in its commercialization territory. If we were to experience difficulty with the commercialization of ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX, or if Sobi were to experience difficulty with the commercialization of ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX in its commercialization territory, we could experience a significant reduction in revenue and may not be profitable. 
         We expect that continued commercialization of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX will depend on many factors, including the following:
 

 the effectiveness of our commercial strategy in and outside of the United States for the marketing of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX; 
 our ability to maintain our development and commercialization arrangements with Sobi (see Item 1. BusinessOur Development
and Commercialization Arrangements with Sobi); 
 the success of our strategies for maintaining and enhancing a positive reputation among hemophilia patients and those in the hemophilia
treatment community as to the efficacy and safety of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX; and 
 other factors described below in this "Risk Factors" section. 

         Many of these factors are beyond our control, and success in any one of these factors will not guarantee success in any of the others. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to generate revenue through the sale of ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX. 
   If our hemophilia products fail to compete effectively, our business and market position would suffer. 
         Due to our dependence on sales of our hemophilia products, our business may be harmed if our products are unable to successfully compete in the hemophilia treatment market. The hemophilia treatment market is highly competitive. We compete in the marketing and sale of our products, and in the development of, and acquisition of rights to, new products and technologies. 
 23

           We compete with biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies that have greater financial, technological and other resources than we do. One or more of our competitors may benefit from significantly greater sales and marketing capabilities, may develop products that are accepted more widely than ours or may receive patent protection that dominates, blocks or adversely affects our product development or business. 
         Our ability to successfully compete with other hemophilia treatments may be adversely affected if our therapies are not regarded by patients, healthcare providers or payors as offering significant benefits and value as compared to other current treatments. We are aware of a number of companies, including large biopharmaceutical companies, such as Bayer AG, Pfizer Inc., CSL Ltd., Roche Holding AG and Shire Plc., that currently market or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of hemophilia. We are also aware of other extended half-life factor products as well as other new technologies, such as gene therapies and bi-specific antibodies, that are in development and, if successfully developed and approved, would compete with ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX. New therapies and technologies have the potential to transform the standard of care for hemophilia patients, and our products may be unable to compete successfully with such new therapies and technologies that may be developed and marketed by other companies. 
         In addition, our relatively recent entrance into the hemophilia treatment market relative to certain of our competitors may impact our ability to develop relationships with the associated medical and scientific community that are necessary to properly inform these communities regarding the relative benefits that our products offer. 
   Issues with product quality or safety, including the perception of such issues, could negatively affect our business, subject us to regulatory or other actions and cause a loss of confidence in us or our products. 
         Our success depends upon the quality and safety of our products. Even after a product is approved for marketing, new safety data may emerge from adverse event reports or post-marketing studies. Previously unknown risks and adverse effects of our products may also be discovered in connection with unapproved or off-label uses of our products. Additionally, FDA, at their discretion, may review and raise new or additional questions related to approved product information. This could result in changes to the approved product prescribing information or to the product approval itself. A quality or safety issue, including the perception of such issues, may result in investigations by regulatory authorities, product liability, adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, requirements for additional labeling or safety monitoring, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address any of these issues in an effective and timely manner may cause negative publicity, loss of physician and patient confidence in the company or its current or future products and may negatively impact physicians' decisions to prescribe our products. These issues could also result in liabilities, loss of revenue, material write-offs of inventory, withdrawal or voluntary recall of our products from the marketplace, delays or limitations in regulatory approvals, material impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges, difficulty in successfully launching new products and other adverse impacts on our results of operations. 
   Our reliance on third parties for our manufacturing and distribution processes increases the risk that we will not have available sufficient quantities of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, or that such quantities may not be available at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization efforts and materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
         We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the commercial manufacture and distribution of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. For example, in connection with the separation and the distribution, we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Biogen as our sole supplier of 
 24

   ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX for a specified period of time. Biogen is currently the sole manufacturer of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. Biogen also relies on third parties with respect to certain aspects of its manufacturing process, including certain sole sources of raw materials. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to distribute our products, including global, regional, and specialty distribution and logistics providers and, for a transition period, Biogen. 
         Biogen and other third party providers are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are outside of our control. Any of these third parties may not perform their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner or in compliance with applicable regulations. Biogen, for instance, may be unable or unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our products. Finding alternative providers could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the specialized nature of these services. 
         In the event we change manufacturing partners or the third parties providing packaging, labeling and/or storage of our products, we may need to obtain approval from applicable regulatory authorities. Manufacturers are generally required to maintain compliance with current cGMPs and other stringent requirements and are subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. These cGMP requirements and regulations are not prescriptive instructions on how to manufacture products, but rather a series of principles that must be observed during manufacturing; as a result, their implementation may not be clearly delineated and may present a challenging task as these regulatory requirements are complex, time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, as our products are biologics, they require processing steps that are more difficult than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection could result in administrative sanctions by the FDA or other U.S. or non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions. 
         We cannot be certain that we could reach agreement with alternative providers or that the FDA or other regulatory authorities would approve our use of alternative manufacturers or providers on a timely basis. Any adverse developments affecting our supply chain may result in development delays, shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the commercial supply of our products. In addition, loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or to deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements, any of which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing or development costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share as patients and physicians turn to competing therapeutics, diminish our profitability or damage our reputation. Moreover, any failure of Biogen to supply ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX could cause us to breach our supply agreements to Sobi for these products, which may subject us to liability under those agreements and impair our relationship with Sobi. 
   Our inability to maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
         Sales of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of coverage, pricing and reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. When a new biopharmaceutical product is approved, the availability of government and private insurance coverage for that product may be uncertain, as may be the pricing of the product and extent to which the product will be reimbursed. Failure to maintain 
 25

   adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
         Pricing and reimbursement for our products may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
 

 changes in federal, state or foreign government regulations or private third party payors' reimbursement policies; 
 pressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs; 
 consolidation and increasing assertiveness of payors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers,
government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations seeking price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies
and, in some cases, imposing restrictions on access to, coverage of or pricing for particular drugs based on perceived value; and 
 the influence of third party organizations advocating for discounted pricing with respect to our products. 

         Our ability to set the price for our products can vary significantly from country to country and, as a result, so can the price of our products. Pricing and acceptance of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in certain countries are also subject to risks due to the tendering process required in those countries, as well as the comparison of dose pricing of our products against conventional treatments. If we are unable to demonstrate to healthcare providers and payors the value of prophylaxis treatment and reduced consumption of our products compared to conventional treatments, our products may not be accepted or we may not secure adequate prices in a particular country. Our inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may limit the marketing of our products within that country, and may also adversely affect our ability to obtain acceptable prices in other markets. This may create the opportunity for third party cross-border trade or influence our decision to sell or not to sell a product in a particular country, thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans and revenues. 
         Pricing for therapies and other health care costs are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are prescribed and continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures, which we anticipate will continue and escalate. As a result, our business and reputation may be harmed. 
   If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or if we are unable to avoid violation of the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others, we may be subject to liability, the operation of our business may be interrupted or our business or prospects may be otherwise harmed. 
         Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent and other intellectual property rights that are important to the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products and product candidates. The degree of patent protection that will be afforded to our products and processes in the United States and in other important non-U.S. markets remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts and lawmakers in those countries. We can provide no assurance that we will successfully obtain or preserve patent protection for the technologies incorporated into our products and processes, or that the scope of patent protection obtained will be sufficient to protect our commercial interests in all countries where we conduct business. If we cannot prevent others from exploiting our inventions, we will not derive the benefit from them that we currently expect. 
 26

           We exclusively license, under an agreement with Amunix, the XTEN technology that is used in connection with certain of our pipeline product candidates. If that agreement were to be terminated or if we otherwise lost our rights to such technology, our ability to develop, manufacture and commercialize such product candidates could be adversely affected, and could materially harm our business prospects. 
         We also rely on regulatory exclusivity for protection of our products. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect for our products in each of these markets due to challenges, changes of interpretations in the law or otherwise, could affect the revenue for our products, our decision on whether to market our products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
         Additionally, we rely in part on confidentiality and non-use agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and other business partners to protect our proprietary technology and processes. If any of these individuals or entities breaches their confidentiality, non-use or similar agreements with us, we may not have adequate remedies for that breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors and even patented by them. If that happens, the potential competitive advantages provided by our intellectual property may be adversely affected. We may then need to license such competing technologies, and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause material harm to our business. Moreover, to the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
         Our success also depends in part on our, and on the people with whom we collaborate and do business, not infringing patents and proprietary rights of others, and not breaching any licenses or other agreements that we or they have entered into with regard to our technologies, products and business. We cannot be certain that patents have not or will not be issued to others that would block our ability to obtain patents or to operate our business as we would like or at all. There may be patents in some countries that, if valid and if we are unsuccessful in circumventing or acquiring rights to them, could block our ability to commercialize products in those countries. There also may be claims in patent applications filed in some countries that, if granted and valid, and if we are unable to circumvent or license them, could also block our ability to commercialize products or processes in those countries. 
         Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, and may in the future be, necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Patent-related claims could include challenges to the scope and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or others. We may also face challenges to regulatory or patent protections covering our products by manufacturers of biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our regulatory or patent exclusivity. 
         Biogen received communications from a third party, Pfizer, regarding a proposal that Biogen take a license to Pfizer's U.S. Patent No. 8,603,777 (Expression of Factor VII and IX Activities in Mammalian Cells) and pay royalties on past and future sales of ALPROLIX. There is no pending litigation with Pfizer and an estimate of a possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. We do not believe this patent would adversely affect our ability to sell ALPROLIX; however, we cannot assure you that we would ultimately prevail if this or any other intellectual property 
 27

   infringement claim is asserted against us, and we may receive in the future other communications from third parties claiming infringement of third party intellectual property rights. 
         The disposition of claims or proceedings is unpredictable and, regardless of the merits or the outcome, may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. Moreover, the disposition and outcome of any such claims or proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights; hinder our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products; lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims; force us to redesign those products or processes that use any allegedly infringing or misappropriated technology, which may result in significant cost or delay to us, or which the redesign of could be technically infeasible; require us to seek a license for the impacted product or technology and pay royalties; or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements, including the possibility of treble damages in a patent case if a court finds us to have willfully infringed certain intellectual property rights. In addition, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products and services. Furthermore, many of our collaboration agreements, including with Sobi, require us to indemnify the collaboration parties for third party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of any such claim. Any of these adverse effects may be material and, consequently, may adversely impact our cash flow, financial position and results of operations. 
   Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business in Japan and other international markets, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
         We are increasing our presence in Japan, Canada and other non-U.S. markets, including in emerging markets, which subjects us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenues, such as:
 

 the inability to obtain necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of products in a timely manner; 
 differing local product preferences and product requirements; 
 changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs; 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, in particular the recent strength of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies; 
 difficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. operations; 
 uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable; 
 differing and increased labor regulations, including non-U.S. work councils; 
 the imposition of governmental controls; 
 less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws; 
 increasingly complex standards for complying with non-U.S. laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may
conflict with corresponding U.S. laws and regulations; 
 government involvement in funding health care in major overseas markets; 
 the far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and the
escalation of investigations and prosecutions pursuant to such laws; 
 compliance with complex import and export control laws; 
 restrictions on direct investments by non-U.S. entities and trade restrictions; 

 28

   

 greater political or economic instability; and 
 changes in tax laws and tariffs. 

         We cannot guarantee that our efforts to initiate or expand sales in these markets will succeed. Some non-U.S. markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on health care. To successfully implement our strategy in non-U.S. markets, we must attract and retain qualified personnel or may be required to increase our reliance on third party distributors within those markets. In addition, many of the countries in emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially. If such currencies devalue and we cannot offset the devaluations, our financial performance within those countries could be adversely affected. In addition, price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental actions could affect our business and results of operations in these markets. 
         In addition, our non-U.S. operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the FCPA. Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws could result in various adverse consequences, including: possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product; recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market; disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges; the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions; the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations; and damage to our reputation. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could adversely impact our business and financial results. 
   Development of our product candidates is expensive and uncertain. If we are unable to successfully develop and test our product candidates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be harmed. 
         A part of our long-term strategy is the continued development of marketed products and our product pipeline programs. The research and development of biological products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and requires significant capital expenditures and management resources. Only a small percentage of product candidates that enter the development process ever receive regulatory approval. The process of conducting the preclinical and clinical testing required to establish safety and efficacy and obtain regulatory approval is expensive and uncertain and takes many years. The FDA and non-U.S. regulatory agencies generally require pre-clinical (animal) testing as well as multiple stages of clinical (human) testing before a product gains regulatory approval, and failure may occur at any stage of testing. It is possible that positive results in a trial may not be replicated in subsequent or confirmatory trials, and success in preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful or that regulatory approval will be obtained. Furthermore, our ability to commence and complete clinical trials may be delayed, and our existing trials may be stopped, due to various factors, including: variability in the number and types of patients available for each study; difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data, unforeseen safety issues or side effects; varying interpretations of clinical trial data; poor or unanticipated effectiveness of candidates during clinical trials; and government or regulatory delays. 
         These risks are enhanced by our reliance on third parties for aspects of the research and development process. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials as well as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct and manage our preclinical and clinical trials and to 
 29

   accurately report their results. Reduced control over these activities may impact our ability to control the timing, conduct, expense, reliability and quality of our clinical trials, but does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibility for trials that we sponsor. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial as well as regulatory standards such as current cGCPs. Failure to fully comply with the study protocol or applicable regulations or regulatory standards could result in the clinical data generated in those studies being deemed unreliable. This failure may also result in the rejection of our product candidates by the FDA or a non-U.S. regulatory agency, or may result in our having to conduct additional audits or require additional clinical studies, which would delay our development programs, require us to incur additional costs and could substantially harm our business and financial condition. If the third parties we rely on for research and development activities do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, do not meet expected deadlines, experience work stoppages, terminate their agreements with us, need to be replaced or do not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties, which could be difficult, costly or impossible. As a result, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, terminated or may need to be repeated. 
         Even if we are able to successfully develop new products or indications, sales of new products or products with additional indications may not meet expectations. Our products may not achieve an adequate level of acceptance in the medical community until longer-term clinical data or other factors demonstrate their safety and efficacy as compared to other alternative treatments. We may also make a strategic decision to discontinue development of a product or indication if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to the standard of care or other opportunities in our pipeline. 
         The occurrence of any of these events could result in significant costs and expenses and lost market opportunities. 
   If our business development activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected. 
         We intend to engage in business development activities, including evaluating potential acquisitions, strategic alliances, collaborations, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may require a substantial investment of our resources, with no certainty of success. Our success developing products or expanding our product portfolio from such business development activities will depend on a number of factors, including:
 

 our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; 
 whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; 
 the strength of the technology and products being licensed or acquired; 
 any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; 
 our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including
the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations; and 
 our ability to access capital markets or incur indebtedness at terms that are satisfactory to us. 

         If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to grow or meet our financial targets and our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. 
 30

          
  We depend on relationships with collaborators and other third parties for revenue, and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain products, which are outside our full control. If our collaborative efforts are unsuccessful, our commercialization strategies or product development may be delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our business, prospects and results of operations. 
         We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a number of significant collaborative and other third party relationships for revenue, and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of our products and product candidates. These third parties may include other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies, academic and research institutions, governments and government agencies and other public and private research organizations. For example, in addition to our collaboration with Sobi, we are pursuing programs with other third parties in hemophilia A and hemophilia B using XTEN technology, gene therapy, gene editing and non-factor bi-specific antibodies, as well as other rare blood disorders. 
         Reliance on collaborative and other third party relationships subjects us to a number of risks, including:
 

 we may be unable to control the resources our collaborator devotes to our programs or product candidates; 
 disputes may arise with respect to ownership of rights to technology developed with our collaborator, and the underlying contract with our
collaborator may fail to provide us with significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if the collaborator fails to perform; 
 our collaborators' interests may not always be aligned with our interests and a collaborator may not pursue regulatory approvals or market a
product in the same manner or to the same extent that we would, which could adversely affect our revenues; 
 the failure to effectively cooperate with our collaborators could adversely affect product sales or the clinical development or regulatory
approvals of product candidates under joint control and could also result in termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, litigation or arbitration; and 
 any failure on the part of our collaborator to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements in the marketing, sale and maintenance
of the market authorization of our products or to fulfill any responsibilities our collaborator may have to protect and enforce any intellectual property rights underlying our products or product
candidates could have an adverse effect on our revenues and involve us in legal proceedings. 

         Given these risks, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline. 
   If we or third parties with whom we do business fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and harm to our business. 
         Our activities, and the activities of our collaborators, distributors and other third party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
         To be approved for marketing, a potential product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Satisfaction of these regulatory requirements typically takes many years. Moreover, regulatory oversight continues to apply after product marketing approval and covers, among other things, testing, manufacturing, distribution, quality control, labeling, advertising, promotion, risk 
 31

   mitigation and adverse event reporting requirements. Our facilities, or those of third parties on which we rely, must be licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Separately, if previously unknown problems occur with regards to our marketed products, any of our products may have to be withdrawn from the market or subject to restrictions. Regulatory agencies may also require additional clinical trials or testing for our products, and our products may be recalled or may be subject to reformulation, changes in labeling, warnings to the public and negative publicity. We are relying on Biogen for a period following the effective time of the distribution to supply and distribute our products to customers while we obtain appropriate regulatory authorizations in certain jurisdictions, such as the United States and Canada. In the United States, we are in the process of securing a Department of Health and Human Services United States License Number, certain state authorizations and other regulatory and government authorizations. In Canada, we are in the process of applying for additional licenses, including a Drug Establishment License from Health Canada. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval to market or engage in distribution or other activities regarding our products. 
         Further, even if we are successful in gaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, the extent to which we are able to commercialize the product may be less than we anticipate. Regulatory authorities may grant marketing approval that is more restricted than anticipated. These restrictions may include limiting indications to narrow patient populations and imposing safety monitoring, educational requirements and REMS. In addition, if we seek to expand or change the use of any of our marketed products, those changes may be subject to vigorous review and include multiple regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. 
         In addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to health care "fraud and abuse" laws governing our interactions in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions with physicians or other health care providers that prescribe or purchase our products. In the United States, these laws include the federal False Claims Act, the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, the Physician Payment Sunshine provisions, and other state and federal laws and regulations. In both the United States and other jurisdictions, health care companies such as ours are facing heightened scrutiny of their relationships with health care providers from anti-corruption enforcement officials and private individuals. Many biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of health care business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations or violations related to environmental matters. There also recently has been enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third party charities that provide such assistance. If we, or our vendors or donation recipients, fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or government guidance in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to significant fines or penalties. Our risks under health care fraud and abuse laws may be heightened as we continue to expand our global operations and if we enter new therapeutic areas with different patient populations, which may have product distribution methods distinct from those we currently utilize. 
         Violations of governmental regulation, such as a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, or any health care fraud and abuse law may be punishable by criminal, civil and administrative sanctions against us as well as against executives overseeing our business. These may include adverse inspection reports; refusal to grant approvals or licenses; warning letters; fines and civil monetary penalties; withdrawal of regulatory approval or licenses; interruption of production; operating restrictions; product recall or seizure; injunctions; criminal prosecution and exclusion from participation in government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as against executives overseeing our business. In addition to penalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be required to repay 
 32

   amounts we received from government payors, or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we have submitted to the government. We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will, in every instance, protect us from acts committed by our employees, collaborators, partners or third party providers that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation into alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business. Any of these actions could cause a loss of confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. Even if it is later determined that we are not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our position and have to divert significant management resources from other matters. 
   Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future health care reforms. 
         In the United States, federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third party payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care. Legislative and regulatory proposals and enactments to reform health care insurance programs could significantly influence the manner in which our products are prescribed and purchased. For example, provisions of the PPACA have resulted in changes in the way health care is paid for by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, including increased rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, the requirement that manufacturers participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under Medicare Part D and the expansion of the number of hospitals eligible for discounts under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. These changes have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our business. In 2017, we face uncertainties as a result of federal and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate or replace some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. There is no assurance that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as amended or replaced in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. 
         There is also significant economic pressure on U.S. state budgets that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our drugs. In recent years, some states have considered legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices of drugs, including laws to allow importation of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside of the United States. and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not paid. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products. 
         In the European Union and some other non-U.S. markets, the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates biotechnology and biopharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care system. Many countries have announced or implemented measures to reduce health care costs to constrain their overall level of government expenditures. These measures vary by country and may include, among other things, patient access restrictions, suspensions on price increases, prospective and possibly retroactive price reductions and other recoupments and increased mandatory discounts or rebates, recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries. These measures have 
 33

   negatively impacted our revenues and may continue to adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in the future. 
   If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, our business may suffer. 
         Our success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our management team and other key employees. Operating as an independent company will demand a significant amount of time and effort from our management and other employees and may give rise to increased employee turnover. If we lose the services of members of our management team or other key employees, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. 
         Our ability to attract, recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including the hiring practices of our competitors, the performance of our commercial products and pipeline programs, our compensation and benefits, work location and work environment and economic conditions affecting our industry generally. If we cannot effectively hire and retain qualified employees, our business, results of operations and prospects could suffer. 
   A breakdown or breach of our technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business. 
         We are increasingly dependent upon technology systems and data, many of which are new or unfamiliar systems. Our intellectual property, computer systems, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by individuals authorized to access our technology systems or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. The increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates additional opportunities for the unintentional dissemination of information and the intentional destruction of confidential information stored in the company's systems or in non-encrypted portable media or storage devices. Cyber attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. While we continue to build and improve our systems and infrastructure and take appropriate security measures to reduce these risks to our intellectual property, data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a negative effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, the misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs. 
   Our business involves environmental risks, which include the cost of compliance and the risk of contamination or injury, which could harm our business. 
         Our business and the business of several of our third party contractors involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biologics and radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our and their safety procedures for the handling and disposing of such materials comply with state, federal and non-U.S. laws and standards, there will always be the risk of accidental contamination or injury. If we were to become liable for an accident, or if a facility in which our products or product candidates were manufactured suffered an extended shutdown, we could incur significant costs, damages or penalties that could harm our business. Manufacturing, distribution and disposal of our products and product candidates also requires compliance with environmental laws and may require permits from government agencies, including governmental authorizations or permits for water supply, wastewater discharge and waste disposal. If we or our contract parties do not obtain or comply with appropriate 
 34

   permits and other requirements of environmental laws, we or they could incur significant penalties and other costs and limits on manufacturing volumes that could harm our business. 
   Significant legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 
         We are subject to the risk of litigation, derivative claims, securities class actions, regulatory and governmental investigations and other proceedings, including proceedings arising from investor dissatisfaction with us or our performance. If any claims were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, the finding could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously adversely impact our business. Allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, regardless of veracity, may harm our reputation and adversely impact our ability to grow our business. 
   Risks Related to the Separation 
   We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation, and the separation could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
         We may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational, marketing or other benefits expected to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. For example, we have undertaken and are undertaking strategic, structural and process realignment actions within our operations. These actions may not provide the benefits we currently expect, and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or inability to recruit, key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses following the separation, weakening of our internal standards, controls or procedures and impairment of our key customer and supplier relationships. 
         By separating from Biogen, we may become more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been if we were still a part of the current Biogen organizational structure. As part of Biogen, we were able to enjoy certain benefits from Biogen's operating diversity, purchasing power and opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with Biogen's other businesses. As an independent, publicly traded company, we do not have similar diversity or integration opportunities and may not have similar purchasing power or access to capital markets. Additionally, as part of Biogen, we were able to leverage Biogen's historical market reputation, performance and brand identity to recruit and retain key personnel to run our business. As an independent, publicly traded company, we do not have the same historical market reputation and performance or brand identity as Biogen. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, operating results, financial condition or prospects may suffer. 
   We may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent company, and we will be reliant on Biogen for the provision of certain services for a period of time. 
         We have historically operated as part of Biogen's corporate organization, and Biogen assisted us by providing various corporate and other business functions. Following the separation, Biogen has no obligation to provide us with assistance other than providing certain services pursuant to agreements described in, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions. If Biogen is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
         The services to be provided by Biogen do not include every service or all of the information and technology systems that we have received from Biogen in the past, and Biogen is only obligated to provide these services for limited periods of time from the distribution date. Accordingly, following the 
 35

   separation, we will need to provide internally or obtain from unaffiliated third parties the systems and services we currently receive from Biogen. 
         If we do not have in place our own systems and services, including technology systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those we receive from Biogen, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. Furthermore, if we fail to obtain the quality of services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining these services, our profitability, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 
   We have only operated as an independent company since February 1, 2017, and we expect to incur increased administrative and other costs following the separation by virtue of our status as an independent public company. Our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future results. 
         The historical information of Bioverativ included in this report refers to our business as operated by and integrated with Biogen and is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Biogen. Accordingly, the historical financial information included in this report does not necessarily reflect the operating results, financial condition or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or what we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors, among others:
 

 Prior to the separation, our business was operated by Biogen as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent
company. Biogen, or one of its affiliates, performed various corporate functions for us, including executive oversight, treasury, finance, legal, human resources, tax planning, internal audit,
financial reporting, information technology, investor relations, shared services, insurance, employee benefits and incentives and share-based compensation. Following the separation, Biogen has
continued to provide some of these functions to Bioverativ, as described in Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions. Our
historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Biogen for such functions, which are likely to be less than the expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a
separate, publicly traded company. Following the separation, our costs related to such functions previously provided by Biogen will likely increase. 
 Historically, we shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships with Biogen. Although
we have entered into certain agreements with Biogen in connection with the separation, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits that we have enjoyed as a result of being integrated with
Biogen and may result in us incurring higher costs than in the past. 
 Following the separation, we may lose certain synergies and benefits we enjoyed as a result of being a part of Biogen. As a part of Biogen, we
benefited from, among other things, access to potential new customers from Biogen and capital to fund acquisitions and investments. In addition, being a part of Biogen enabled us to leverage Biogen's
technological capabilities, data and commerce platforms. 
 Generally, prior to the separation, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and
capital expenditures, were satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of Biogen. Following the separation, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public
offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or through strategic relationships or other arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly. 

 36

   

 After the separation, the cost of capital of our business may be higher than Biogen's cost of capital prior to the separation. 
 Our historical financial information does not reflect our obligations to purchase from Biogen certain operations and assets, and assume the
corresponding liabilities, of Biogen's business after the separation date. 

         Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from Biogen. For additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of preparation of the historical consolidated financial statements of our business, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. 
   The separation may result in disruptions to, and negatively impact our relationships with, our customers and other business partners. 
         Uncertainty related to the separation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in our existing business relationships, or cause them to delay entering into business relationships with us or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. These disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. The effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by any delays in the completion of the separation. 
   Our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject following the distribution. 
         Our financial results historically were included within the consolidated results of Biogen, and until the distribution occurred, we were not directly subject to reporting and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We currently qualify as an "emerging growth company" and for so long as we remain so qualified we will be exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires auditor attestation to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. We are, however, immediately subject to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. At such time as we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we will be broadly subject to reporting and other requirements under the Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which will require, among other things, annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. These and other obligations will place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting and information technology resources. To comply with these requirements, we anticipate that we will need to further upgrade our systems, including duplicating computer hardware infrastructure, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting, finance and information technology staff. If we are unable to do this in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired and our business could be harmed. 
 37

     If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Biogen and its stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities, and we could be required to indemnify Biogen for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement. 
         Completion of the separation from Biogen was conditioned on the receipt by Biogen of an opinion from Biogen's tax counsel or other third party advisor regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that will qualify under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Except as otherwise noted, it is expected that the distribution will qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes to Biogen and the holders of Biogen common stock. The opinion was received and was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of us and Biogen, including those relating to the past and future conduct of us and Biogen. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or Biogen breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. 
         Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could determine on audit that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings are incorrect or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. 
         If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, is ultimately determined to be taxable, Biogen and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities. For example, if the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, Biogen would, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be treated as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and those Biogen stockholders who are subject to U.S. federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock received in the distribution. 
         Under the tax matters agreement we entered into with Biogen, we would potentially be required to indemnify Biogen against taxes incurred by Biogen that arise as a result of our taking or failing to take, as the case may be, certain actions that result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Code. If we are required to indemnify Biogen under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition. 
   We will be subject to numerous restrictions to preserve the tax-free treatment of the transactions in the United States, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility. 
         Our ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted after the distribution in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the distribution by Biogen. Even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment, the distribution may result in corporate-level taxable gain to Biogen under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of shares of our stock or Biogen's stock are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. The process for determining whether an acquisition or issuance triggering these provisions has occurred is complex, inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. Any acquisitions or issuances of our stock or Biogen's stock within a two-year period after the distribution generally are presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or Biogen, as applicable, may be able to 
 38

   rebut that presumption. Accordingly, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Biogen, for the two-year period following the distribution, we will be prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from:
 

 entering into any transactions resulting in the acquisition of 40% or more of our stock or substantially all of our assets, whether by merger
or otherwise; 
 merging, consolidating or liquidating; 
 issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds; 
 repurchasing our capital stock; or 
 ceasing to actively conduct our business. 

         These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, we will be required to indemnify Biogen against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of our stock or assets, even if we do not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition. 
   Our agreements with Biogen may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiations with unaffiliated third parties. 
         The agreements we entered into with Biogen related to the separation, including, among others, the separation agreement, the tax matters agreement and the transition services agreement, were entered into in the context of the separation while we were still controlled by Biogen. Until the distribution occurred, Biogen effectively had the sole and absolute discretion to determine and change the terms of the separation, including the terms of any agreements between Biogen and us and the establishment of the record date and distribution date. As a result, the terms of such agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. 
   We will be subject to continuing contingent tax related liabilities of Biogen following the distribution. 
         After the distribution, there are several significant areas where the liabilities of Biogen may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of Biogen's consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for such taxable period. The tax matters agreement we entered into with Biogen allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of Biogen's consolidated tax reporting group between us and Biogen. If Biogen were unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, however, under applicable law we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state, local or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities. 
   In connection with the separation, we assumed and agreed to indemnify Biogen for certain liabilities. If we are required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities to Biogen, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. 
         Pursuant to the separation agreement and certain other agreements we entered into with Biogen, we assumed and agreed to indemnify Biogen for certain liabilities for uncapped amounts, which may include, among other items, associated defense costs, settlement amounts and judgments Payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the distribution and certain 
 39

   related transactions. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities of the Biogen business. Biogen agreed to indemnify us for liabilities of the Biogen business, but such indemnity from Biogen may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and Biogen may not fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Biogen any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. 
   Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
   The market price for our common stock may fluctuate widely. 
         The market price of our shares of common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:


 our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other comparable companies; 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; 
 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; 
 announcements by us or our competitors of significant investments, acquisitions or dispositions; 
 the failure of securities analysts to cover our shares of common stock after the distribution; 
 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; 
 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; 
 overall market fluctuations; and 
 general economic conditions. 

         Stock markets in general often experience volatility that is unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our shares of common stock. You may not be able to resell your shares of common stock following periods of volatility because of the market's adverse reaction to volatility. When the market price of a company's common stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. This type of lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources. 
   Future sales or distributions of our common stock could cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline. 
         As a result of the separation, Biogen distributed approximately 108 million shares of our common stock to its stockholders, all of which are freely tradeable without restriction or further registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), unless the shares are owned by one of our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act. The sale of significant amounts of our shares or the perception in the market that this will occur may result in the lowering of the market price of our shares. We can offer no assurance that Biogen's stockholders will continue to hold the shares they received in the distribution. 
   Your percentage ownership in the company may be diluted in the future. 
         In the future, your percentage ownership in the company may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we issue stock options or other share-based awards to employees under our employee benefits plans. 
 40



        In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over the company's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as the board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 
   The public announcement of data from clinical studies or news of any developments related to our or our competitors' products or pipeline may cause significant volatility in our stock price. 
         As we evolve into a standalone company, we will be focusing efforts and resources on further commercializing our existing products, as well as building a diversified pipeline of products into areas of unmet medical need. We expect that investors may place heightened scrutiny on some of our products in development when making investment decisions in the company compared to how such product developments relating to our business were previously viewed by investors when such programs part of the larger Biogen. The announcement of data from clinical studies by us or our collaborators or news of any developments related to our or our competitors' products or pipeline may cause significant volatility in our stock price. Furthermore, the announcement of any negative or unexpected data or the discontinuation of development of any of our key pipeline product candidates, or any delay in anticipated timelines for filing for regulatory approval, could cause our stock price to decline significantly. 
   We do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. 
         We do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on the value of their shares of our common stock. 
   Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt. 
         Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. For example, our corporate governance documents include provisions:
 

 authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common
stock; 
 limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers; 
 limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings; 
 eliminating the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting; 
 requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of
candidates for election to our board of directors; and 
 limiting the determination of the number of directors on our board of directors and the filling of newly created seats on the board to our
board of directors then in office. 

 41

   These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in our management. 
         As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. 
         In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the tax matters agreement, we would be required to indemnify Biogen for any resulting taxes, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable. 
   Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. 
         Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will be the sole and exclusive forum for:
 

 any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; 
 any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees of the company to us or
our stockholders; 
 any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL; or 
 any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine under Delaware state corporate law. 

 This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.
