Item 1. Business
Overview
Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. ("CBA") is the sixth largest craft brewing company in the U.S. and a leader in brewing, branding, and bringing to market world-class American craft beers.
Our distinctive portfolio combines the power of Kona Brewing Company, a fast-growing national craft beer brand, with an expanding stable of strong regional breweries and innovative lifestyle brands, including Appalachian Mountain Brewery, Cisco Brewers, Omission Brewing Co., Redhook Brewery, Square Mile Cider Co. and Widmer Brothers Brewing. We nurture the growth and development of our brands in today’s increasingly competitive beer market through our state-of-the-art brewing and distribution capability, integrated sales and marketing infrastructure, and strong focus on partnerships, local community and sustainability. 
CBA was formed in 2008 through the merger of Redhook Brewery and Widmer Brothers Brewing, the two largest craft brewing pioneers in the Northwest at the time. Following a successful strategic brewing and distribution partnership, Kona Brewing Co. joined CBA in 2010 and has become one of the fastest-growing craft brands in the U.S. As part of CBA, Kona has expanded its reach across all 50 U.S. states and approximately 30 international markets, while remaining deeply rooted in Hawaii.
In addition to growing and nurturing distinctive brands steeped in local heritage, Craft Brew Alliance is committed to developing innovative new category leaders, such as Omission Beer, which is the #1 beer in the gluten-free beer category, and Square Mile Cider.
As the craft beer market continues to grow and consumers increasingly demand local offerings, Craft Brew Alliance has expanded its portfolio of brands and maximized its brewing footprint through strategic partnerships with emerging craft beer brands in targeted markets. In 2015, we announced strategic partnerships with Appalachian Mountain Brewery, based in Boone, North Carolina; and Cisco Brewers, based in Nantucket, Massachusetts. Through this strategic partnership model, we gain local relevance in select beer geographies, while our partner breweries gain access to our world-class leadership and national brewing and sales infrastructure to grow their brands. In December 2016, we announced a new strategic partnership with Wynwood Brewing Co., a fast-growing craft brewery based in the heart of Miami’s multicultural arts district.
Publicly traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol BREW, Craft Brew Alliance is headquartered in Portland, Oregon and operates breweries and brewpubs across the U.S. For more information about CBA and its brands, see “Available Information” on page 13.
We proudly brew our craft beers in four company-owned breweries located in Portland, Oregon; the Seattle suburb of Woodinville, Washington; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and Kailua-Kona, Hawaii; and, through the end of 2016, one partner brewery in Memphis, Tennessee. In 2016, we entered into a contract brewing agreement with A-B Commercial Strategies, LLC (“ABCS”), an affiliate of Anheuser-Busch, LLC (“A-B”), and are beginning the process of transitioning our current production volume out

of Memphis into ABCS’s facilities. Additionally, we own and operate two 10-barrel innovation breweries in Portland, Oregon and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which are primarily used for small batch production and limited-release brews.
We distribute our beers to retailers through wholesalers that are aligned with the A-B network. These sales are made pursuant to a Master Distributor Agreement (the “A-B Distributor Agreement”) with A-B, which extends through 2028. As a result of this distribution arrangement, we believe that, under alcohol beverage laws in a majority of states, these wholesalers would own the exclusive right to distribute our beers in their respective markets if the A-B Distributor Agreement expires or is terminated. In 2016, Kona, Redhook and Widmer Brothers beers were distributed in all 50 states. Omission Beer continues to expand into new markets in the U.S. and internationally, while Square Mile Cider is currently available in 13 states in the West. Separate from our A-B wholesalers, we maintain an internal independent sales and marketing organization with resources across the key functions of brand management, field marketing, field sales, and national retail sales.
We operate in two segments: Beer Related operations and Brewpubs operations. Beer Related operations include the brewing, and domestic and international sales, of craft beers and ciders from our breweries. Brewpubs operations include our five brewpubs, four of which are located adjacent to our Beer Related operations, other merchandise sales, and sales of our beers directly to customers.
Industry Background
We are one of the top six brewers in the craft brewing segment of the U.S. brewing industry. The domestic beer market includes ales and lagers produced by large domestic brewers, international brewers and craft brewers. Shipments of craft beer in the U.S. are estimated by industry sources to have increased by approximately 7% in 2016 over 2015 and by 12% in 2015 over 2014. While the overall domestic market experienced a modest increase in shipments of 0.3% in 2016, the craft beer segment continued its growth and captured market share from the rest of the domestic market. Craft beer shipments in 2016 and 2015 were approximately 14.5% and 13.6%, respectively, of total beer shipped in the U.S. Approximately 30.0 million barrels and 28.1 million barrels, respectively, were shipped in the U.S. by the craft beer segment during 2016 and 2015, while total beer sold in the U.S., including imported beer, was 207.5 million barrels and 206.8 million barrels, respectively. Compared with the other segments of the U.S. brewing industry, craft brewing is a relative newcomer. Twenty years ago, Redhook and Widmer Brothers Brewery were two of the approximately 200 craft breweries in operation. By the end of 2016, the number of craft breweries in operation had grown to more than 5,000. Industry sources estimate that craft beer produced by regional and national craft brewers, similar to us, accounts for approximately two-thirds of total craft beer sales, with one-third of the production brewed by smaller craft breweries.
Our comprehensive portfolio and national scale provide a competitive advantage in today’s market environment, which includes craft brewers, domestic specialty beers, and imports. Our distinctive brand portfolio is positioned to address significant changes in consumer trends, including increased demand for innovative flavors and styles, a growing interest in sustainability, and the increasing importance of local relevance. As an example, Kona Brewing is one of the most distinctive craft brewers, with a broad portfolio of beers that reflect a uniquely Hawaiian flavor profile, a recognized track record in sustainable business practices, and deep ties to its local community as Hawaii’s oldest and largest craft brewery.
Business Strategy 
At Craft Brew Alliance, we believe we have an advantaged strategy that differentiates us in the rapidly evolving craft beer segment.
The central elements of our business strategy include:

• | An innovative complementary portfolio of beers and ciders, which includes national lifestyle brands such as Kona and Omission, as well as storied regional craft brands that reflect changing consumer trends around variety, flavor and locale.


• | Distinct, authentic craft beer brands with rich stories that are rooted in their local communities, including Widmer Brothers, Redhook Brewery, and Kona Brewing Company, and bold new trailblazers Omission Beer and Square Mile Cider Company, as well as strong regional craft partners such as Appalachian Mountain Brewery and Cisco Brewers.


• | A national brewing footprint that allows us to get our beers to market faster, fresher and more efficiently. We have significant flexibility to fully leverage the specific strengths of our distinct breweries and operations. Additionally, we guarantee the quality and consistency of all of our products through fine-tuned processes designed to ensure that everything, from brewing to quality-assurance to warehousing and distribution, meets our high standards. We believe that maximizing production under our direct supervision and through accomplished and expert partners is critical to our success. Further, we believe that our ability to engage in ongoing product innovation and to control product quality provides critical competitive advantages. Each of our breweries is modern, has flexible production capabilities, and is designed to produce beer in smaller batches compared to the national domestic brewers, thereby allowing us to brew a wide variety of brand offerings. We believe that our investment in brewing and logistics technologies enables us to minimize brewery operating costs and consistently produce innovative beer styles.

• | Nationwide sales activation through robust partnerships with leading retailers. We leverage our national sales and marketing capabilities and complementary brand families to create a unique identity in the distribution channel and with the consumer. Our sales force calls on all retail channels nationally, including grocery, drug and convenience stores, something most other craft brewers are not positioned to do.


• | National seamless distribution through the Anheuser-Busch wholesaler network alliance. This distribution footprint provides efficiencies in logistics and product delivery, state reporting and licensing, billing and collections. We have realized these efficiencies while maintaining full autonomy over the production, sale and marketing of our products as an independent craft beer company.


• | A diverse leadership team with extensive experience in the beer and beverage industries. The team has a proven ability to manage brand lifecycles, from development to turnaround, in both large and growth-company settings.

Brand Overview
Our portfolio includes our owned brands, the Kona Brewing Company, Widmer Brothers Brewing, Redhook Brewery, Omission Beer and Square Mile Cider Company brand families, along with partner brands Appalachian Mountain Brewery and Cisco Brewers.
We produce a variety of specialty craft beers and ciders using traditional brewing methods complemented by American innovation and invention. We brew our beers using high-quality hops, malted barley, wheat, rye and other natural traditional and nontraditional ingredients. To craft our ciders, we use three apple varieties from the Pacific Northwest and then use a lager beer yeast to make a unique and easy-to-drink hard cider.
Below is an overview of our five owned brands:
Kona Brewing Company
Kona Brewing Company was born in Kailua-Kona on the Island of Hawaii in the spring of 1994 by father and son team Cameron Healy and Spoon Khalsa, who had a dream to create fresh, local island brews made with spirit, passion and quality. Today, Kona is Hawaii’s largest and favorite craft brewery, known for top-selling flagship beers Longboard Island Lager and Big Wave Golden Ale and award-winning innovative small-batch beers available across the Islands. The Hawaii-born and Hawaii-based craft brewery prides itself on brewing the freshest beer of exceptional quality closest to market, which helps to minimize its carbon footprint by reducing shipping of raw materials, finished beer and packaging materials.
Kona Brewing Company has become one of the top craft beer brands in the world, while remaining steadfastly committed to its home market through a strong focus on innovation, sustainability and community outreach. 
Widmer Brothers Brewing
Widmer Brothers Brewing founders Kurt and Rob Widmer helped create the Pacific Northwest craft beer movement in 1984 when, in their 20s, they began brewing unique interpretations of traditional German beer styles. In 1986, Widmer Brothers Brewing introduced the original American-style Hefeweizen, which elevated the brewery to national acclaim and has long been Oregon’s favorite craft beer. The brewery’s iconic Hefe celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2016 and remains one of the most awarded craft beer brands in the U.S. For more than three decades, Widmer Brothers has continued to push the boundaries of craft beer, developing a variety of beers with an unapologetic, uncompromising commitment to innovation. Based in Portland, Oregon, the brewery currently brews a variety of beers including Hefeweizen, Upheaval IPA, Steel Bridge Porter, Drop Top Amber Ale, and a full seasonal lineup. Additionally, the Widmer Brothers innovation brewery continues to make limited edition, small-batch beers available exclusively in Oregon and at the Widmer Brothers pub in North Portland.
Redhook Brewery
Redhook was born out of the energy and spirit of the early 1980s in the heart of Seattle. While the term didn’t exist at the time, Redhook became one of America’s first craft breweries with its focus on creating “better beers.” From a modest start in a former transmission shop in the Seattle neighborhood of Ballard to a Fremont trolley barn that housed The Trolleyman brewpub, to its current breweries in Woodinville, Washington, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Redhook has become one of America’s most recognized craft breweries. Redhook will open a 10-barrel brewpub in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle in 2017. 

While Redhook has “grown up” over the past 30 years, one thing has never changed - Redhook is still brewing great beers like ESB and Long Hammer IPA, which is one of the top-ten IPAs in the U.S., along with a variety of seasonal beers. Redhook beers are available on draft and in bottles and cans around the country.

Omission Beer
Omission is the first craft beer brand in the United States focused exclusively on brewing great-tasting craft beers with traditional ingredients-including malted barley-that are crafted to remove gluten. Brewed in Portland, Oregon, Omission tests the gluten levels in every batch through an independent lab that uses the R5Competitive Eliza test to ensure that gluten levels are less than 20 parts per million. Test results for every batch of Omission beer are available to consumers at: www.omissiontests.com. Omission produces three craft beers specially crafted to remove gluten: Omission Lager, Omission Pale Ale and Omission IPA. Omission has been the #1 beer brand in the gluten-free beer category for well over a year.
Square Mile Cider Company
Launched in 2013, Square Mile Cider is the hard cider for the modern day pioneers celebrating the spirit of the Pacific Northwest. We set out to reinvigorate an enduringly classic American beverage with a blend of hand-selected apples combined with unique Northwest ingredients. Square Mile Cider produces two varieties of hard cider, The Original and Spur & Vine, our hopped version.
We also have brewing and distribution arrangements with partner brands, which included the following partners in 2016:
Appalachian Mountain Brewery
Appalachian Mountain Brewery, LLC is dedicated to making seriously delicious craft beer while focusing its business model on community, sustainability and philanthropy. Their Pints for Non-Profits program collaborates with local organizations that are dedicated to enriching the land, water, air and people of the High Country. Appalachian Mountain Brewery has earned numerous awards for its innovative craft beers and ciders, including Boone Creek Blonde Ale, which won a Gold Medal at the U.S. Open Beer Championships in 2016. The brewery’s core portfolio also includes Long Leaf IPA, Spoaty Oaty Pale Ale, and Porter, which is a gold medal winner at the Great International Beer and Cider Competition.
Cisco Brewers
Cisco Brewers is a craft brewery that embodies Nantucket’s “away off shore” lifestyle. Cisco Brewers is a unique operation, proud to be one of the very first producers in the United States crafting beer, wine, and spirits. Their home base is a major attraction for locals and tourists alike, and is regularly highlighted in the media as one of the top destinations on Nantucket Island. Cisco Brewers' year-round offerings include Whale’s Tale Pale Ale, Grey Lady, and Indie IPA.
Developments in Brands and Packaging 
Our recent brand and packaging developments include:
Kona Brewing
In 2016, Kona Brewing Co. capitalized on the IPA craft trend with the launch of a new Island-inspired, tropical brew, Hanalei Island IPA, in Hawaii and southern California, followed by a national launch in January 2017. As with all of Kona’s beers, Hanalei Island IPA was named for a specific place in Hawaii, Hanalei Bay in Kauai, and evokes the spirit of Hawaii with distinctive local ingredients. Brewed with Hawaii’s beloved POG (pineapple, orange and guava) juice, Hanalei Island IPA is a coppery, laidback, session-style ale with tropical flavors and just 4.5% alcohol by volume ("ABV"). 2016 represented the seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth for the Hawaiian brewery on the mainland, as Kona continued to expand Longboard Lager and Big Wave distribution across all 50 states. We also added new countries to our distribution network, bringing Kona beers to more than 30 countries.
Widmer Brothers Brewing
In 2016, Widmer Brothers announced the arrival of its flagship beer Hefe in cans. Hefe has been the brewery’s flagship beer for 30 years, and the Original American Hefeweizen is still the best-selling craft beer in Oregon. To celebrate Hefe’s 30th anniversary in 2016, the storied, award-winning beer was launched in 12-ounce cans in six- and 12-packs in the Oregon market exclusively. As part of its ongoing commitment to its hometown, Widmer Brothers tapped three new beers in 2016 that were themed around the Portland Timbers MLS team. The first, launched in March 2016, was a rye altbier collaboration with Timbers Head Coach Caleb Porter and the Portland Timbers coaching staff called First Star, after the gold star worn by MLS Cup champion teams to signify their title wins. The brewery also tapped Thrill of Victory Cascadian Dark Ale, a collaboration with Columbus Brewing as part of a bet between the two breweries before last year’s MLS Championship game between the Timbers and the Columbus Crew. In September 2016, Widmer Brothers Brewing and Portland Timbers Goalkeeper Jake Gleeson teamed up to brew a small-batch, commemorative beer , “Centennial Celebration IPA,” a pineapple rye India Pale Ale, to mark the 100th consecutive Portland Timbers regular season match sellout.

Redhook Brewery
In 2016, Redhook continued to pay homage to its roots as the first craft brewery in Seattle. The brewery launched a new packaging design that evokes the brewery’s earliest days in the Emerald City and announced that it will open a new innovation brewery in the historic Capitol Hill neighborhood. 
In May 2016, Redhook introduced a new summer seasonal that is a true Seattle original. Summerhook is a golden rye ale made for Seattle summers: picnics at Green Lake, day games at Safeco Field, or warm evenings at the Fremont Solstice Fair. Summerhook is a golden rye ale that features crisp hoppiness and rye malt characteristics. Summerhook’s light body and 4.7% ABV make it a refreshing must for the season. Redhook also released a new national beer, American Pale Ale. This hoppy addition to Redhook’s year-round lineup, featuring classic red, white and blue packaging, was available nationally starting in July 2016. Redhook’s take on the American Pale Ale style integrates classic Chinook and Cascade hop characters into this easy-drinking and full-flavored pale ale. At 4.7% ABV, the sessionable American Pale Ale is a great beer for any occasion throughout the year, including Fourth of July barbeques, game nights, and casual hangouts with friends. American Pale Ale is available nationally in six- and twelve-packs, and on draught. The brewery also continued its partnership with the University of Washington and its beloved football and basketball teams. 
Omission Beer
In 2016, Omission Beer maintained its position as the market leader in the gluten-free beer category. Omission IPA continued to expand into new markets across the country, following in the footsteps of Omission Lager and Pale Ale. With a focus on the healthy and active lifestyle consumer, Omission Beer remains a favorite among those consumers seeking a great-tasting beer crafted to remove gluten.
Square Mile Cider Company
In 2016, Square Mile Cider Company continued to expand distribution into 12 states, becoming the number one locally produced cider in the Northwest. The brand, which finds its inspiration from the pioneering spirit of the original Oregon pioneers, continues to offer two varieties: The Original, a classic American hard cider; and Spur & Vine, a hopped version of the classic American hard cider, with the addition of Citra and Galaxy hops.
Brewing Operations
Brewing Facilities
We use highly automated brewing equipment at our four owned production breweries and also operate two smaller, manual brewpub-style brewing systems. As of December 31, 2016, our total owned production capacity was 1,075,000 barrels. Our breweries include:

• | Oregon Brewery. Our Oregon Brewery is our largest capacity production brewery and we expect to complete construction on our expansion of the brewery’s annual capacity in 2017.


• | Washington Brewery. Our Washington Brewery utilizes a 100-barrel brewing system.


• | New Hampshire Brewery. Our New Hampshire Brewery utilizes a 100-barrel brewing system and uses an anaerobic waste-water treatment facility that completes the process cycle.


• | Hawaiian Brewery. Our Hawaiian Brewery utilizes a 25-barrel brewing system and utilizes a 229-kilowatt photovoltaic solar energy generating system to supply approximately 50 percent of its energy requirements through renewable energy. In 2016, we held a ground breaking ceremony for a new brewery near our existing brewery and pub in Kona. The new brewery, which is being built with sustainability in mind, is scheduled to go online in the first quarter of 2019.


• | Innovation Breweries. In 2016, we built a new 10-barrel innovation brewery adjacent to our main Portland production brewery. The brewery is focused on releasing innovative small-batch and limited release beers in the local market. Our New Hampshire innovation brewery system maintains a 3-barrel pilot brewing system and is located on the same site as our New Hampshire production brewery.

In addition to our owned brewing capacity, we supplemented our 2016 production needs through a brewing partnership with Blues City Brewing in Memphis, Tennessee. This partnership, which began in 2014, provided us the ability to produce up to 100,000 barrels at this location annually. In 2016, we entered into a contract brewing agreement with ABCS and will be transitioning our current production volume out of Memphis into ABCS’s facilities during 2017.
Packaging
We package our craft beers in cans, bottles and kegs. All of our production breweries, with the exception of the Hawaiian Brewery, have fully automated bottling and keg lines. The bottle fillers at all of the breweries utilize a carbon dioxide environment during bottling, ensuring that minimal oxygen is dissolved in the beer and extending the beer’s shelf life. We offer an assortment of packages to highlight the unique characteristics of each of our beers and to provide greater opportunities for customers to drink 
6

Index

our beers in more locations and at more events and occasions, matching the active lifestyles and preferences of our consumers. Additionally, in our Portland Widmer Brothers Brewpub, we package our small-batch and innovation beers for consumers in crowlers.
Quality Control
We monitor production and quality control at all of our breweries, with central coordination at the Oregon Brewery. All of the breweries have an on-site laboratory where microbiologists and lab technicians supervise on-site yeast propagation, monitor product quality, test products, measure color and bitterness, and test for oxidation and unwanted bacteria. We also regularly utilize outside laboratories for independent product analysis. In addition, every batch of beer that we produce goes through an internal taste panel to ensure that it meets our taste and profile standards.
Ingredients and Raw Materials
We currently purchase a significant portion of our malted barley from two suppliers and our premium-quality select hops, mostly grown in the Pacific Northwest, from competitive sources. We also periodically purchase small lots of hops from international sources, such as New Zealand and Western Europe, which we use to achieve a special hop character in certain beers. In order to ensure the supply of the hop varieties used in our products, we enter into supply contracts for our hop requirements. We believe that comparable quality malted barley and hops are available from alternate sources at competitive prices, although there can be no assurance that pricing would be consistent with our current arrangements. We currently cultivate our own yeast supply for certain strains and maintain a separate, secure supply in-house. We have access to multiple competitive sources for packaging materials, such as labels, six-pack carriers, crowns, cans and shipping cases.
Contract Brewing
We enter into contract brewing arrangements in an effort to absorb excess capacity under which we produce beer in volumes and per specifications as designated by the arrangements.
During 2016, we shipped 26,700 barrels under contract brewing arrangements, compared to 36,800 barrels in 2015 and 39,700 in 2014.
Brewpubs Operations
We own and operate five brew-pub restaurants and retail stores that support consumer awareness and research and development. Our five brew-pub restaurants allow us to interact directly with over 1.5 million consumers annually in our home markets, which creates a sense of brand loyalty. Our brewers are continually experimenting with different varieties of hops and malts in all styles of beer, and our brewpubs allow us to bring those beers to market in test-size batches in order to evaluate their potential prior to releasing them on a wider basis. 
Distribution
With limited exceptions, all brewers in the United States are required to sell their beers to independent wholesalers, who then sell the beers to retailers. We are the only independent craft brewer in the U.S. to have established a wholly-aligned distribution network through our partnership with A-B. This partnership provides us national distribution, which results in both an effective distribution presence in each market and administrative efficiencies. Our beers are available for sale directly to consumers in draft, cans and bottles at restaurants, bars and liquor stores, as well as in cans and bottles at supermarkets, warehouse clubs, convenience stores and drug stores. We sell beer directly to consumers at our brewpubs and breweries.
Our products are distributed in all 50 states, pursuant to a master distributor agreement with A-B that allows us access to A-B’s national distribution network. For additional information regarding our relationship with A-B, see “Relationship with Anheuser-Busch, LLC” below. Management believes that our competitors in the craft beer segment generally negotiate distribution relationships separately with wholesalers in each locality and, as a result, typically distribute through a variety of wholesalers representing differing national beer brands with uncoordinated territorial boundaries.
In 2016 and 2015, we sold approximately 693,300 barrels and 753,400 barrels, respectively, to the wholesalers in A-B’s distribution network, accounting for 89.4% and 91.4%, respectively, of our shipment volume for the corresponding periods.
Sales and Marketing
In addition to leveraging our owned brewpubs and retail locations, we promote our products through a national sales and marketing network that includes, but is not limited to, i) creating and executing a range of advertising programs; ii) training and educating 
7

Index

wholesalers and retailers about our products; and iii) promoting our name, product offerings, brands, and experimental beers at local festivals, venues and brewpubs.
We advertise and promote our products through an assortment of media, including television, radio, billboard, print and social media, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, in key markets and by participating in cooperative programs with our wholesalers whereby our spending is matched by the distributor. We believe that the financial commitment by the distributor helps align the distributor’s interests with ours, and the distributor’s knowledge of the local market results in an advertising and promotion program that is targeted in a manner that will best promote our products.
Our breweries also play a significant role in increasing consumer awareness of our products and enhancing our image as a craft brewer. Thousands of visitors per year take tours at our breweries and all of our production breweries have a retail restaurant or pub where our products are served. In addition, several of the breweries have meeting rooms that the public can rent for business meetings, parties and holiday events, and that we use to entertain and educate wholesalers, retailers and the media about our products. At our brewpubs, we sell various items of apparel and other merchandise bearing our trademarks, which creates further awareness of our beers and reinforces our brand image. To further promote retail canned and bottled product sales, and in response to local competitive conditions, we regularly recommend that wholesalers offer discounts to retailers in most of our markets.

Distributor Agreement
The Master A-B Distributor Agreement (the "A-B Distributor Agreement"), as amended in August 2016, provides for the distribution of our brands, as well as those of AMB and Cisco, in all states, territories and possessions of the United States, including the District of Columbia and, except with respect to Kona beers, all U.S. military, diplomatic, and governmental installations in a U.S. territory or possession.

Contract Brewing Agreement
On August 23, 2016, we entered into a Contract Brewing Agreement (the “Brewing Agreement”) with A-B Commercial Strategies, LLC (“ABCS”), an affiliate of A-B, pursuant to which ABCS will brew, bottle and package up to 300,000 barrels of our mutually agreed products annually, in facilities owned by ABCS within the United States, for an initial term through December 31, 2026. We are in the process of transitioning our current production volume from our contract brewer in Memphis, Tennessee, to ABCS’s facilities. We will share equally with ABCS in any cost savings arising from the Brewing Agreement, provided that our cost savings will equal at least $10.00 per barrel on an aggregate basis, following certain adjustments as set forth in the Brewing Agreement. 
The Brewing Agreement provides specified termination rights, including, among other things, the right of either party to terminate the Brewing Agreement if (i) the other party fails to perform any material obligation under the Brewing Agreement, subject to certain cure rights, (ii) the International Distribution Agreement (as defined below) is terminated pursuant to certain specified provisions thereof, or (iii) subject to certain conditions, if the Master Distributor Agreement (as defined above) is terminated pursuant to certain specified provisions thereof.

International Distribution Agreement
On August 23, 2016, we also entered into an International Distribution Agreement (the “International Distribution Agreement”) with Anheuser-Busch Worldwide Investments, LLC (“ABWI”), an affiliate of A-B, pursuant to which ABWI will be the sole and exclusive distributor of our malt beverage products in jurisdictions outside the United States, subject to the terms and conditions of our agreement with our existing international distributor, CraftCan Travel LLC, and certain other limitations, in each case as set forth in the International Distribution Agreement. Under the International Distribution Agreement, following delivery of notice to us, ABWI may also elect to commence brewing outside of the United States some or all of the products to be distributed in the non-U.S. jurisdictions covered by the International Distribution Agreement. 
Under the terms of the International Distribution Agreement, with respect to our exported products produced by us, ABWI will pay us our costs of production plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to export shipment costs. Additionally, ABWI will pay us an international royalty fee based on volume of our products sold by ABWI, equal to either $40 per barrel or $30 per barrel, depending on certain factors described in the International Distribution Agreement, which royalty fee will be subject to escalation annually, beginning in calendar year 2018, on the terms described in the International Distribution Agreement. For calendar year 2016, 2017 and 2018, ABWI will also pay us one-time fees of $3.0 million, $5.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively. The sum of the fees is recognized in Beer Related Net sales on a straight-line basis over the 10-year contract term, while the fees are collected in the first quarter of the year following the applicable calendar year.
The International Distribution Agreement contains specified termination rights, including, among other things, the right of either party to terminate the International Distribution Agreement if (a) the other party fails to perform any material obligation under the International Distribution Agreement, subject to certain cure rights or (b) the Brewing Agreement is terminated pursuant to certain specified provisions thereof. In addition, ABWI has the right to terminate the International Distribution Agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice to us following (i) a “change of control event” (as defined above) that occurs or for which a definitive agreement is entered into prior to August 23, 2019, and is subsequently completed, or (ii) the earliest of (x) our rejection of a “qualifying offer” (as defined above), (y) the completion of a transaction implementing a qualifying offer, and (z) our failure to enter into a definitive transaction agreement within 120 days following receipt of a qualifying offer, with certain exceptions (each of the foregoing subclauses (x) through (z), a “qualifying offer lapse”). Following termination of the International Distribution Agreement due to a qualifying offer lapse, or any change of control event, ABWI shall have the right to purchase the international distribution rights for each of our brands then being distributed under the International Distribution Agreement at the fair market value of such rights, and on otherwise customary terms and conditions, as set forth in the International Distribution Agreement. 
Under the International Distribution Agreement, ABWI will also be required to make a one-time $20.0 million payment to us on August 23, 2019. The payment is being recognized in Beer Related Net sales on a straight-line basis over the 10-year contract term. However, ABWI will not (subject to compliance with certain notice requirements) be obligated to make such one-time payment if, prior to that date, (i) a “change of control event” occurs or a definitive agreement for a transaction constituting a change of control event is entered into, (ii) ABWI (or an affiliate thereof) makes a qualifying offer and there is a qualifying offer lapse or (iii) we enter into a definitive agreement with ABWI (or an affiliate thereof) with respect to a qualifying offer but such agreement

is subsequently terminated, other than for certain regulatory reasons (in which case the $20.0 million shall remain payable). Unless terminated sooner, the International Distribution Agreement will continue in effect until December 31, 2026.
Exchange Agreement
We have also entered into an Amended and Restated Exchange and Recapitalization Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with A-B, pursuant to which we have granted A-B certain contractual rights. The Exchange Agreement originally was entered into in 2004 as part of a recapitalization in which we redeemed preferred shares held by A-B in exchange for cash and the shares of our common stock currently held by A-B. A-B owned 31.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock at December 31, 2016.
The Exchange Agreement entitles A-B to designate two members of our board of directors. A-B also generally has the right to have a designee on each committee of the board of directors, except where prohibited by law or stock exchange requirements, or with respect to a committee formed to evaluate transactions or proposed transactions between A-B and us. The Exchange Agreement contains limitations on our ability to take certain actions without A-B’s prior consent, including, but not limited to, our ability to issue equity securities or acquire or sell assets or stock, amend our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, grant board representation rights, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, distribute our products in the United States other than through A-B or as provided in the A-B Distributor Agreement, or voluntarily terminate our listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
On August 23, 2016, A-B and we entered into an amendment to the Exchange Agreement providing A-B with rights, following a “change of control event” or a “qualifying offer,” similar to those described above under “Distributor Agreement.”
Contract pricing may not be commensurate with amounts that an independent market participant would pay due to the related party nature of the agreements.
Fees
We pay fees to A-B in connection with the sale of our products, including margin fees, invoicing, staging and cooperage handling fees, and inventory manager fees.
See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Relationship with Pabst Northwest Brewing Company
On January 8, 2016, we entered into brewing agreements ("the brewing agreements") with Pabst Northwest Brewing Company ("Pabst"), a subsidiary of Pabst Brewing Company, under which Pabst has the ability to brew selected Rainier Brewing Company and other brands at our brewery in Woodinville, Washington under a license agreement. The brewing agreements expire on December 31, 2018. During 2016, we recorded $1.6 million in fees earned from Pabst related to a contract brewing volume shortfall in Contract brewing and beer related sales.
In conjunction with the brewing agreements, we granted Pabst an option to purchase the Woodinville brewery and adjacent pub, as well as related assets (together, the "Property"), at any time prior to termination of the brewing agreements. The purchase price of the Property will be $25.0 million if Pabst exercises the option during the first year of the agreement (which has elapsed), $26.0 million if exercise occurs during the second year of the agreement, and $28.0 million if Pabst exercises the option during the third year of the agreement and on or before the close of business on December 31, 2018. Under the option agreement, Pabst conducted an additional diligence review of environmental and title issues relating to the Property, and, upon completion, did not exercise its right to terminate either the brewery agreements or the option agreement. If Pabst does not exercise its option to purchase the Property, it may be required to pay us a termination fee.
Seasonality
Our sales generally reflect a degree of seasonality, with the first and fourth quarters historically exhibiting low sales levels compared to the second and third quarters. Accordingly, our results for any particular quarter are not likely to be indicative of the results to be achieved for the full year.

Competition
We compete in the craft brewing market as well as in the much larger alcoholic beverage market, which encompasses domestic and imported beers, flavored alcohol beverages, spirits, wine and ciders.
In 2016, the craft brewing industry continued to experience unprecedented change and competition, characterized by three trends: 1) the growing number and popularity of new local craft breweries that captured market share from established craft breweries, 2) continued acquisition and investment activity between craft brewers, large domestic and foreign brewers, and private equity firms, and 3) continued competitive pressure from international brewers, including Crown, which target both domestic and craft beer drinkers. In 2016, according to industry sources, A‑B and MillerCoors accounted for almost 80% of total beer shipped in the U.S., excluding imports. In addition, A-B and MillerCoors have continued to invest in existing smaller craft breweries and nurtured separate craft-focused divisions in an effort to capitalize on the growing craft beer segment and consumer trend for locally produced products.
Competition varies by regional market. Depending on the local market preferences and distribution, we have encountered strong competition from microbreweries, regional specialty brewers and several national craft brewers that include MillerCoors’ Tenth and Blake Beer Company division (“Tenth and Blake”), Constellation Brands, and A-B’s High End division. A-B’s High End division includes Goose Island, Blue Point Brewing, 10 Barrel Brewing Company, Elysian, Golden Road, Shock Top, Karbach Brewing and others. Because of the large number of participants and offerings in this segment, along with the accelerating consumer preference for local offerings, the competition for packaged product placements and especially draft beer placements has intensified. Although certain of these competitors distribute their products nationally and may have greater financial and other resources than we have, we believe that we possess certain competitive advantages, including our unique portfolio strategy that combines strong national lifestyle brands supported by distinctive regional craft brands, the scale and specialization of our production breweries, strategically distributed sales and marketing resources, and alignment within the A-B distribution network.
We also compete against imported brands, such as Heineken, Stella Artois, Corona Extra and Guinness, which typically have significantly greater financial resources than we have. Although imported beers currently account for a greater share of the U.S. beer market than craft beers, we believe that craft brewers possess certain competitive advantages over some importers, including lower transportation costs, no importation costs, proximity to and familiarity with local consumers, a higher degree of product freshness, eligibility for lower federal excise taxes and absence of exposure to currency fluctuations.
In response to the growth of the craft beer segment, the major domestic national brewers have invested in purchasing small craft breweries. The major national brewers, including Tenth and Blake through MillerCoors, and A-B High End brands through A-B, have significantly greater financial resources than we do and have access to a greater array of advertising and marketing tools to create product awareness of these offerings.
In the past several years, several major distilled spirits producers and national brewers have introduced flavored alcohol beverages. Products such as the Bud Light Rita family, Smirnoff Ice, the hard soda category, and Mike’s Hard Lemonade have captured sizable market share in the higher-priced end of the malt beverage industry. We believe sales of these products, along with strong growth in the imported and craft beer segments of the malt beverage industry, contributed to an increase in the overall U.S. alcohol market. These products are particularly popular in certain regions and markets in which we sell our products.
Competition for consumers of craft beers also comes from wine and spirits, which reflects today’s millennial consumers who typically drink across three alcoholic beverage categories in a single drinking occasion. Growth in this segment appears to be attributable to competitive pricing, television advertising, increased merchandising and increased consumer interest in local wine and craft spirits. Recently, the wine industry has been aided, on a limited basis, by its ability to sell outside of the three-tier system, allowing sales to be made directly to the consumer. While the craft beer segment competes with wine and spirits, it also benefits from many of the same advantages enjoyed by wine and spirit producers. These include consumers who allow themselves affordable luxuries in the form of high quality alcoholic beverages.
A significant portion of our sales continues to be in the Pacific Northwest and in California, which we believe are among the most competitive craft beer markets in the United States, both in terms of number of participants and consumer awareness. We believe that these areas offer significant competition for our products, not only from other craft brewers but also from the growing wine market and from flavored alcohol beverages. Additionally, we are monitoring the impact of cannabis as more states legalize marijuana for retail sales. Our recent marketing efforts have been focused on promoting the authenticity of our pioneering owned brands and partner brands, the appeal of our newer brands and better segmenting our marketing strategies to communicate the attributes of our portfolio to our target consumers. We believe that our broad array of beers and brands enables us to offer an assortment of flavors and experiences that appeal to more people.

Regulation
Our business is highly regulated at federal, state and local levels. Various permits, licenses and approvals necessary for our brewery and pub operations and the sale of alcoholic beverages are required from a number of agencies, including the U.S. Treasury Department, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), state alcohol regulatory agencies, and state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and environmental agencies. In addition, the beer industry is subject to substantial federal and state excise taxes.
The FDA issued a proposed rule in November 2015 on the use of “gluten-free” labeling for fermented and hydrolyzed foods and beverages that may affect our ability to market our Omission Beer. The proposed rule is under review by the Office of Management and Budget and is expected to become final in April 2017. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.
We operate our breweries under federal licensing requirements imposed by the TTB. The TTB requires the filing of a “Brewer’s Notice” upon the establishment of a commercial brewery and the filing of an amended Brewer’s Notice any time there is a material change in the brewing or warehousing locations, brewing or packaging equipment, brewery ownership, or officers or directors. Our operations are subject to audit and inspection by the TTB at any time.
Management believes that we currently have all of the licenses, permits and approvals required for our current operations. Existing permits or licenses could be revoked if we fail to comply with the terms of such permits or licenses and additional permits or licenses may be required in the future for our current operations or as a result of expanding our operations.
The U.S. federal government currently levies an excise tax of $18 per barrel on beer sold for consumption in the United States; however, brewers, such as us, that produce less than two million barrels annually are taxed at $7 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels shipped, with shipments above this amount taxed at the normal rate. Certain states also levy excise taxes on alcoholic beverages. Excise taxes may be increased in the future by the federal government or any state government or both. In the past, increases in excise taxes on alcoholic beverages have been considered in connection with various governmental budget-balancing or funding proposals. In January 2017, the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act (S.236/H.R. 747) was introduced in both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. If enacted, the act would provide significant tax relief to all brewers and importers. Our benefit would be significant because it would reduce the excise tax from $7 to $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels shipped and from $18 to $16 per barrel shipped on the next 6 million barrels shipped.
Federal and State Environmental Regulation
Our brewing operations are subject to environmental regulations and local permitting requirements and agreements regarding, among other things, air emissions, water discharges and the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes. While we have no reason to believe the operation of our breweries violate any such regulation or requirement, if such a violation were to occur, or if environmental regulations were to become more stringent in the future, we could be adversely affected.
Dram Shop Laws
The serving of alcoholic beverages to a person known to be intoxicated may, under certain circumstances, result in the server being held liable to third parties for injuries caused by the intoxicated customer. Our restaurants and brewpubs have addressed this issue by maintaining reasonable hours of operation and routinely performing training for personnel.
Trademarks
We have obtained U.S. trademark registrations for numerous products. Trademark registrations generally include brand names and logos and specific product names. The Kona Brewing Co., Widmer Brothers Brewing, Redhook, and Omission marks and certain other marks are also registered in various foreign countries. We regard our Kona Brewing Co., Widmer Brothers Brewing, Redhook, Omission, Square Mile and other trademarks as having substantial value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our products. We are not aware of any infringing uses that could materially affect our current business or any prior claim to the trademarks that would prevent us from using such trademarks in our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of our material trademarks in our markets whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our trademarks.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 800 people, including 395 employees in the brewpubs and retail stores, 180 employees in production, 135 employees in sales and marketing and 90 employees in corporate and administration. Included in the totals above are 184 part-time employees and 9 seasonal or temporary employees. None of our employees are represented by a union or employed under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees to be good.
