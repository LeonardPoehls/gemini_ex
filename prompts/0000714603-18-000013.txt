Item 1.    Business
DST Systems, Inc. is a global provider of technology-based information processing and servicing solutions. References below to “DST,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” may refer to DST Systems, Inc. exclusively or to one or more of our consolidated subsidiaries. We provide business solutions through a unique blend of industry knowledge and experience, technological expertise and service excellence to clients in the asset management, brokerage, retirement, healthcare and other markets. The Company was formed in 1969. Through a reorganization in August 1995, we are a corporation organized in the State of Delaware.
NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
DST uses our proprietary software applications to provide sophisticated information processing and servicing solutions through strategically unified data management and business process solutions to clients globally within the asset management, brokerage, retirement, healthcare and other markets. Our wholly-owned data centers provide the secure technology infrastructure necessary to support our solutions.
On January 11, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (“SS&C”) and Diamond Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of SS&C (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into DST, with DST surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of SS&C (the “Merger”).
At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of DST issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to certain exceptions as provided in the Merger Agreement) shall be converted into the right to receive $84.00 in cash, without interest, for a total enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion, including assumption of debt. The transaction is currently expected to close before the end of the second quarter of 2018 and is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement; however, there can be no assurances as to the actual closing or the timing of the closing. 
In March 2017, we acquired State Street Corporation’s (“State Street”) ownership interest in our joint ventures Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (“BFDS”) and International Financial Data Services, U.K. (“IFDS U.K.”), as well as other investments and real estate held by International Financial Data Services, L.P. (“IFDS L.P.”). BFDS and IFDS U.K. were consolidated in our financial results from the date control of these entities was obtained. 
We sold our North American Customer Communications business on July 1, 2016 and sold our United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Customer Communications business on May 4, 2017. We have classified the results of the Customer Communications businesses sold as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. 
Beginning in 2017, DST established a new reportable segment structure that reflects how management is now operating the business and making resource allocations following the acquisitions of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. and BFDS, as well as the recent reductions in non-core investment assets. The Company’s operating business units are now reported as three operating segments (Domestic Financial Services, International Financial Services and Healthcare Services).  Prior periods have been revised to reflect the new reportable operating segments. 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, DST’s operating revenues were $2,086.7 million. Segment operating revenues, as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues (excluding intersegment revenues), were 54.2%, 25.8%, and 20.0% contributed from the Domestic Financial Services, International Financial Services, and Healthcare Services segments, respectively. 
DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT
Through the Domestic Financial Services segment, we provide investor, investment, advisor/intermediary and asset distribution services to companies within the United States (“U.S.”) financial services industry. Utilizing our proprietary software applications, we offer our clients information processing solutions to support direct and intermediary sales of mutual funds, alternative investments, securities brokerage accounts and retirement plans. This includes transaction processing; account opening and maintenance; reconciliation of trades, positions and cash; corporate actions; regulatory reporting and compliance functions; and tax reporting. We also support full reporting to investors for confirmations, statements and tax forms, web access, and electronic delivery of documents.
Services are provided either on a remote processing (“Remote”) or business process outsourcing (“BPO”) basis utilizing our proprietary software applications, including our TA 2000® and TRAC® systems. Our BPO service offerings are enhanced by

AWD®, our proprietary workflow software, which is also licensed separately to third parties. In the U.S., we provide services to mutual funds, brokerage firms, retirement plans and alternative investment funds (such as real estate investment trusts “REITs”). 
Accounts serviced under shareowner recordkeeping arrangements with the mutual fund and alternative investment sponsors are referred to as “registered accounts.” Registered accounts include both tax-advantaged and non tax-advantaged accounts on the books of the transfer agent. We also contract directly with broker/dealers to manage brokerage subaccounts. 
Additionally, we deliver a comprehensive suite of asset servicing, distribution solutions and asset management for open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds and alternative investment funds. Focusing on the needs of small- to medium-sized funds that require a broad set of customizable services, we provide compliance, creative services, medallion distribution, fund administration, fund accounting, legal, tax administration, transfer agency and asset management services. 
Our distribution services range from consulting to active wholesaling and marketing, including closed-end funds IPO launch platform services. We also offer products designed to assist clients in meeting the expanding needs associated with distributing U.S. investment products through financial intermediaries. 
We serve as the asset manager to proprietary open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds through active management and through the utilization of sub-advisors and index providers. Additionally, we offer data analytics and consulting services in the U.S. to help our clients gain actionable insights into the needs and preferences of their customers. 
We typically have multi-year agreements with our clients. Domestic Financial Services segment fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts, participants or transactions processed. For subaccounts, broker/dealers provide a portion of the services directly. As a result, our revenue per account is generally higher for registered accounts than for subaccounts. On a more limited basis, we also generate revenue through asset-based fee arrangements, subscriptions and/or seat licensing and from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in our full service transfer agency bank accounts.
The Domestic Financial Services segment’s largest client accounted for 10.0% of the segment’s operating revenues in 2017 and the five largest Domestic Financial Services clients collectively accounted for 18.8% of the segment’s operating revenues in 2017. 
Sources of new business for the Domestic Financial Services segment include: (i) existing clients, particularly with respect to complementary and new products and services, (ii) companies relying on their own in-house capabilities and not using outside vendors, (iii) companies using competitors’ systems, and (iv) new entrants into the markets we serve. We believe that competition in the markets in which the Domestic Financial Services segment operates is based largely on price, quality of service, features offered, the ability to handle rapidly changing volumes, response to security and compliance needs, product innovation, and responsiveness. Our competitors are primarily financial institutions and in-house systems. Our financial institution competitors may have an advantage because they may take into consideration the value of their clients’ funds on deposit or under management when pricing their services. We believe there is significant competition in our markets and our ability to compete effectively is dependent in part on access to capital. 
 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT
We offer investor and policyholder administration and technology services on a Remote and BPO basis in the U.K. and, through our joint venture IFDS L.P., in Canada, Ireland and Luxembourg, utilizing our proprietary FAST platform and IFDS L.P.’s iFAST platform. Additionally, in Australia and the U.K., we provide solutions related to participant accounting and recordkeeping for wealth management, “wrap platforms” and retirement savings (“superannuation”) industries/markets through use of our wealth management platform (Bluedoor) and our life and pension administration system (Percana). 
Our primary clients are mutual fund managers, insurers, and platform providers. International Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts or transactions processed. We also realize revenues from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage or members increase. Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from the fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations. We typically have multi-year agreements with our clients.
The International Financial Services segment’s largest client accounted for 24.4% of the segment’s operating revenues in 2017 and the five largest International Financial Services clients collectively accounted for 55.7% of the segment’s operating revenues in 2017. 
Sources of new business for International Financial Services segment include: (i) existing clients, particularly with respect to complementary and new products and services, (ii) companies relying on their own in-house capabilities and not using outside vendors, (iii) companies using competitors’ systems, and (iv) new entrants into the markets we serve. We believe that

competition in the markets in which the International Financial Services segment operates is based largely on price, quality of service, features offered, the ability to handle rapidly changing volumes, response to security and compliance needs, product innovation, and responsiveness. We believe there is significant competition in our markets and our ability to compete effectively is dependent in part on access to capital. 
 HEALTHCARE SERVICES SEGMENT
The Healthcare Services segment uses our proprietary software applications to provide healthcare organizations with pharmacy, healthcare administration, and health outcomes optimization solutions to satisfy their information processing, quality of care, cost management and payment integrity needs. Our healthcare solutions include claims adjudication, benefit management, care management, business intelligence and other ancillary services. The Healthcare Services segment’s five largest clients accounted for 48.7% of segment operating revenues in 2017, including 18.6% from its largest client. 
Our healthcare services are marketed to health insurance companies, health plans and benefits administrators. Clients primarily consist of managed care organizations, preferred provider organizations, third-party administrators, dental, vision, and behavioral health organizations operating commercial and government sponsored programs such as the Health Insurance Exchanges that operate under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid. 
We compete with other third-party providers and companies that perform their services in-house with licensed or internally developed systems and processes. We believe that we compete effectively in the market due to our ongoing investment in our products and the development of new products to meet the evolving business requirements of our clients.
Our competitors’ healthcare administration and health outcomes optimization solutions are primarily based on complete replacement of a payer’s core system. We believe that a component application approach shifts the focus away from core application replacement to one in which clients have more alternatives for modernization of the business operation. With a component approach, health payer clients can still choose core application replacement if warranted, or adopt component applications that address only those areas of the business that offer the most opportunity of improvement for the client, resulting in protection of the client’s current IT investment and less disruption to its business operation.
Pharmacy Solutions
We use our proprietary software applications, supporting technology and enhanced clinical expertise to provide pharmacy health management solutions supporting commercial, Medicaid and Medicare Part D plans. These services include pharmacy claims administration, pharmacy network solutions, government programs administration, formulary and rebate management, trend control and quality compliance programs, member services, and discount drug card programs. RxNova, our proprietary claims processing system, is a highly scalable and comprehensive system for the administration of pharmacy benefits, prescription claims adjudication, eligibility, pharmacy management, and related activities. This benefit management solution provides substantial flexibility to accommodate varying provider requirements, allows point-of-sale monitoring, and provides control of pharmacy plan benefits with online benefit authorization. 
We generally derive revenue from our pharmacy-solutions business on a transactional fee basis. Fees are earned on pharmacy claims processing and payments services, pharmacy and member call center services, formulary and rebate administration, administration or management of clinical programs, pharmacy network management, member and plan web services and management information and reporting. We also receive investment earnings on cash balances maintained in our bank accounts related to funds held to satisfy our client’s pharmacy claim obligations.
Healthcare Administration
We use our proprietary software applications to provide medical claim administration services and health plan compliance and revenue integrity services for payers and providers in the domestic healthcare industry.  Healthcare administration services are offered on a software license, Remote and BPO basis. Our solutions, combined with our health outcomes optimization solutions described below, are offered as stand-alone component solutions to complement health plans, existing operations or systems, or as an integrated core administration package of solutions.
Claims administration services include claims processing, benefit plan management, eligibility and enrollment management, provider contract administration, mail receipt and processing, imaging/data capture and retention, fulfillment, utilization management, and customer service. Health plan compliance and revenue integrity services include a retrospective review of medical records to accurately capture members’ health status through proper hierarchical condition categories. 
Healthcare administration revenues are generally derived from fees charged on a per member/per month basis or transactional basis. We also realize revenue from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage or members increase.

Health Outcomes Optimization 
We provide health outcomes optimization solutions through the use of our integrated care management and population health analytics applications and professional services for health plans and providers in the domestic healthcare industry.  Our Integrated Care Management solution is a real-time, intuitive, workflow-driven solution suite that assists clients to improve member outcomes and manage costs. Our population health technology provides organizations with the ability to measure and manage federal and state required quality management initiatives, provider network quality and efficiency, member health programs, and risk adjustment on an integrated system. In addition to our proprietary systems, we are the exclusive distributor of Johns Hopkins’ Adjusted Clinical Groups (“ACG”), a patient classification system developed by Johns Hopkins University. The ACG System is a software tool that provides health plans the ability to easily identify their at-risk population and stratify them into the optimal care management program. 
Professional services include business and industry consulting, risk adjustment, compliance and regulatory consulting, behaviorally based interventions, healthcare quality incentive management, medical management (disease, care, and utilization), HEDIS, managed information technology, software engineering, operations process engineering and management consulting.
Health outcomes optimization revenues are generally derived from fees charged based on a per member/per month basis. We also realize revenue from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage or members increase. Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE
DST’s software development and maintenance efforts are focused on introducing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. The software development, maintenance and enhancement costs, including capitalized software development costs, were $243.0 million, $217.3 million and $205.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We hold U.S. patents, U.S. copyrights and trademarks covering various aspects of the information processing and computer software services and products provided by the Domestic Financial Services, International Financial Services and Healthcare Services segments. The duration of the patent term is generally 20 years from its earliest application filing date. The patent term is not renewable. The durations of the copyrights depend on a number of factors, such as who created the work and whether he or she was employed by us at the time. The trademark rights generally will continue for as long as we maintain usage of the trademarks. We believe our copyrights are adequate to protect our original works of authorship. We believe that although the patents, trademarks and copyrights related to the segments are valuable, our success primarily depends upon our product and service quality, marketing and service skills. Despite patent, trademark and copyright protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our systems or processes. In addition, other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable to our systems and processes.
EMPLOYEES
We had approximately 14,200 total employees at December 31, 2017, of which approximately 7,500 employees were located in the U.S. and approximately 6,700 employees were located internationally. Additionally, our joint ventures had approximately 1,500 employees in Canada, Ireland, Luxembourg and the U.S. at December 31, 2017. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
