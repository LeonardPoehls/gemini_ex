ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Inc. is a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing our proprietary controlled cooling technology platform. Our first commercial product, the CoolSculpting system, is designed to selectively reduce stubborn fat bulges. CoolSculpting is based on the scientific principle that fat cells are more sensitive to cold than the overlying skin and surrounding tissues. CoolSculpting utilizes precisely controlled cooling to reduce the temperature of fat cells in the treated area, which is intended to cause fat cell elimination through a natural biological process known as apoptosis, without causing scar tissue or damage to the skin, nerves, or surrounding tissue. We developed CoolSculpting to safely, noticeably, and measurably reduce the fat layer within a treated fat bulge without requiring the patient to diet or exercise. In our pivotal U.S. clinical trial involving 60 patients, physicians were able to accurately differentiate between pre- and post-treatment photographs in 88% of the patients, while unable to identify aesthetic benefits in the remaining 12%. We received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in September 2010 to market CoolSculpting for the selective reduction of fat around the flanks, an area commonly referred to as the “love handles.” We received further FDA clearance in May 2012 to use CoolSculpting for the selective reduction of fat around the abdomen area. In April 2014, CoolSculpting was cleared by the FDA for treatment of the thigh area, and, in January 2015, CoolSculpting was cleared by the FDA for treatment at lower temperatures which enables shorter treatment times. In September 2015, the FDA cleared CoolSculpting for treatment of the submental area under the chin, an area that is consistently ranked as one of the top areas of concern both by consumers and physicians. In March 2016, CoolSculpting was cleared for the additional treatment areas of around the bra straps, on the back, and underneath the buttocks or “banana roll.” Most recently, in November 2016, the FDA cleared the CoolSculpting treatment of the upper arm. Additionally, in July 2016, the CoolSculpting system achieved China FDA approval for non-invasive fat reduction of the abdomen and flanks. We sell our CoolSculpting system primarily to dermatologists, plastic surgeons, aesthetic specialists and general practice physicians and generate revenue primarily from sales of our CoolSculpting system and from sales of consumables to our customers. Consumables are the CoolSculpting procedure packs we sell that are needed to perform procedures using our CoolSculpting system. 
The global market for aesthetic procedures is significant. In the United States alone, the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, or the ASAPS, estimates that consumers spent approximately $13.5 billion on aesthetic procedures in 2015. Invasive procedures (such as liposuction and tummy tucks, arm, buttock and thigh lifts) and minimally-invasive procedures (such as laser-assisted liposuction, laser lipolysis or injection lipolysis) effectively reduce fat but involve surgical procedures that require significant physician skill and resources, may involve pain, downtime, and expense for the patient, and carry the risks associated with any surgical procedure. Existing non-invasive procedures, which currently include those based on radio 
3

frequency, laser, or high intensity focused ultrasound, avoid the patient downtime and high costs of invasive and minimally-invasive procedures, but often are painful, produce limited or inconsistent results, and may require multiple treatments, and ongoing maintenance treatments. In addition, existing non-invasive procedures are not capable of selectively targeting fat cells, which can lead to damage to the surrounding tissues. Further, the treatment methods used by many existing invasive, minimally-invasive, and non-invasive procedures acutely injure fat cells in the treated area, which leads to fat cell elimination through a biological process known as necrosis. Unlike apoptosis, necrosis triggers the body's wound-healing response and can result in scar tissue formation in the treated area. This scar tissue can lead to stiffening of the treated area and limits the number of times a patient can undergo these types of procedures in one area or the efficacy of any repeat treatments. 
We developed CoolSculpting to provide patients with a safe, effective, non-invasive, and convenient procedure to reduce stubborn fat bulges that are not satisfactorily served by existing fat reduction and body contouring procedures. CoolSculpting is clinically proven to reduce fat bulges, allowing most patients to achieve noticeable and measurable aesthetic results without the pain, expense, downtime, and risks associated with invasive and minimally-invasive procedures. Further, these results are achieved without the pain, multiple procedures, and maintenance programs required with other non-invasive procedures. Because the fat layer in the treated area is reduced by eliminating fat cells that will not be replaced by the body, we believe the aesthetic benefits patients achieve through CoolSculpting will be durable. In addition, patients can elect to repeat the CoolSculpting procedure multiple times on the same treatment area if they desire further fat reduction. We offer training to our customers to better enable them to identify those patients whose aesthetic appearance will be noticeably improved by the reduction of their fat bulges through CoolSculpting. Due to these advantages, we believe CoolSculpting is appealing to both existing consumers who have previously had one or more aesthetic procedures, and to new consumers who have not previously elected to undergo an aesthetic procedure. 
Our customers can market CoolSculpting as a highly differentiated, non-invasive fat reduction procedure. Based on our commercial data and customer experiences, we have seen attractive economic benefits for our customers. In addition, the CoolSculpting procedure does not require significant training or skill, as it is largely automated. Once the procedure is initiated, the CoolSculpting system is self-monitoring, allowing our customer to see and treat other patients or perform concurrent procedures (such as injections or other dermal treatments) on the same patient during the balance of the CoolSculpting procedure. Further, we believe CoolSculpting's appeal will allow our customers to target the aesthetic first-time user market and expand their aesthetic practices. 
We market CoolSculpting to dermatologists, plastic surgeons, aesthetic specialists and general practice physicians. Aesthetic specialists are physicians who elect to offer aesthetic procedures as a significant part of their practices, but are not board-certified dermatologists or plastic surgeons. Some of the practices to which we sell have purchased or may elect to purchase more than one CoolSculpting system. We utilize our direct sales organization to market and sell CoolSculpting in our North American market which includes the United States and related territories, as well as Canada. In our markets located outside of North America, we market and sell CoolSculpting through both a direct sales force and a network of distributors. Our sales force and distributors target dermatologists, plastic surgeons, aesthetic specialists and general practice physicians who have practices focused on aesthetic procedures and who express a willingness to position CoolSculpting as a differentiated treatment and participate in our practice marketing and support programs. Revenue from markets outside of North America accounted for 20%, 24% and 23% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We are driving growth in CoolSculpting procedures through our targeted marketing programs that provide our customers with practice development programs which include organization assessments and recommendations, sales training, practice marketing strategies, and metric analysis. After we establish a significant installed base of CoolSculpting systems in specific markets, we partner with our customers' practices on marketing, advertising, and promotional activities in their local markets to drive demand for CoolSculpting. To further enhance and expand our brand awareness, in 2015 we launched a direct-to-consumer advertising campaign, which includes television, radio and print media, throughout the U.S. and in selected target cities in North America and Europe. Direct-to-consumer advertising builds awareness in the marketplace by having consumers (a) go to existing local practices and request treatment and drive consumable revenue, or (b) go to their local physician who does not yet have consumable services, create the desire and drive system revenue. System revenue consists of our CoolSculpting control unit and our CoolSculpting applicators.
We generate revenue from sales of our CoolSculpting system and from sales of cycles in the form of consumable procedure packs to our customers. As of December 31, 2016, we had an installed base of approximately 6,000 CoolSculpting systems installed across approximately 4,800 practices worldwide. As of December 31, 2016, 3.9 million CoolSculpting revenue cycles had been shipped to our customers and distributors. A cycle is an authorization to perform one procedure to one specific area on the body; customers can only perform a treatment if they have purchased a cycle. We generated revenue of $354.2 million, $255.4 million and $174.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. System revenue represented 45%, 51% and 53% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Consumable revenue accounted for 55%, 49% and 47% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Our business is dependent upon the success of CoolSculpting, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in significantly expanding physician and patient demand for CoolSculpting. In addition, we will continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future as we expand our commercialization and other business activities. Although, based upon our current plans and market conditions, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain profitability. 
Merger with Allergan
On February 13, 2017, ZELTIQ, Allergan Holdco US, Inc. (which we refer to as Allergan US), a subsidiary of Allergan plc (which we refer to as Allergan), and a wholly owned subsidiary of Allergan US (which we refer to as merger sub), entered into an agreement and plan of merger, which we refer to as the merger agreement, pursuant to which ZELTIQ will merge with and into merger sub, with ZELTIQ surviving the merger as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Allergan.
Upon the consummation of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of ZELTIQ common stock (other than (1) treasury shares, (2) shares held by Allergan US, merger sub, or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan US, and (3) dissenting shares) will be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive $56.50 in cash, without interest. All outstanding vested options shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the difference between $56.50 and the exercise price for each share subject to the vested option, subject to applicable withholding taxes; all outstanding vested restricted stock units (RSUs), and all performance restricted stock units (PRSUs), shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the $56.50 for each share subject to the vested RSU or PRSU, subject to applicable withholding taxes; and all unvested stock options and RSUs will be assumed by Allergan in the merger. Each outstanding unvested option and RSU shall be exercisable or shall be settled upon the same terms and conditions as under the applicable ZELTIQ equity compensation plan, except that each option shall be exercisable for, and each RSU shall be converted into the right to receive, shares of Allergan ordinary shares using an exchange ratio based on the average closing sales price per share of Allergan ordinary shares for the ten trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the closing of the merger.
The merger agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants of ZELTIQ and Allergan US, including, among others: (a) representations relating to the accuracy of ZELTIQ ' filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; (b) ZELTIQ ' ownership of and other rights in its intellectual property; (c) Allergan US's authority to enter into the merger agreement; and (d) covenants by ZELTIQ to conduct its business in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the merger agreement and the merger and not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period.

The consummation of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including requisite ZELTIQ stockholder approval. The merger agreement also includes termination provisions for both ZELTIQ and Allergan US. In connection with a termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances involving competing transactions, a change in ZELTIQ’s board of directors’ recommendation of the merger to ZELTIQ’s stockholders or other triggering events, ZELTIQ may be required to pay Allergan US a termination fee of $74 million. In connection with a termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances involving failure to obtain clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (“HSR”), to consummate the merger within nine months from the date of the merger agreement, subject to two extensions of up to 90 days each (provided other closing conditions are satisfied) or legal restraint of the merger arising under HSR, Allergan US may be required to pay ZELTIQ a reverse termination fee of $75 million. 
The merger agreement is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 15, 2017. 
Market Overview
The global market for aesthetic procedures is significant. The ASAPS estimates that U.S. consumers spent approximately $13.5 billion on approximately ten million aesthetic procedures in 2015. According to the ASAPS, cosmetic procedures have increased by 39% over the past five years with nonsurgical procedures up 44%. The top five aesthetic surgical procedures were liposuction, breast augmentation, tummy tuck, eyelid surgery and breast lift, while the top five non-surgical procedures were botulinum toxin injections, hyaluronic acid, hair removal, chemical peel and microdermabrasion. No one treatment procedure is offered by all physicians, and treatments vary in terms of the treatment goal and desired effect. As a result, the total aesthetic market as reported by the ASAPS does not represent the market potential for CoolSculpting or any other single product or treatment, but illustrates that each year patients elect to have millions of procedures to enhance their appearance.

We believe several factors are contributing to the ongoing growth in aesthetic procedures, including: 

• | Continuing focus on body image and appearance. Both women and men continue to be concerned with their body image and appearance, fueled in part by popular culture's perpetuation of the ideal thin body type for women and the ideal lean and defined body type for men. We believe the size and wealth of the aging “baby boomer” demographic segment and its desire to retain a youthful appearance for professional and personal reasons have driven the growth in aesthetic procedures.


• | Broader availability of safe non-invasive aesthetic procedures. Technological developments have resulted in the introduction of a broader range of safe, non-invasive aesthetic procedures. According to the ASAPS, non-invasive aesthetic treatments are growing faster than invasive surgical procedures.


• | Increased physician focus on aesthetic procedures. We believe increased restrictions imposed by managed care and government agencies on reimbursement for medical treatments are motivating our customers to establish or expand their elective aesthetic practices, which generally consist of procedures paid for directly by patients. We expect this trend to continue as our customers look for ways to expand their practices and improve profitability.

Limitations of Existing Fat Reduction and Body Contouring Procedures 
The following outlines the benefits and limitations of existing body contouring procedures:
Fat reduction and body contouring procedures, including invasive, minimally-invasive, and non-invasive procedures, have become increasingly popular. The following discussion outlines the benefits of these existing procedures, as well as our opinion of the inherent limitations of these procedures when compared to CoolSculpting. Many of the companies marketing these procedures have greater resources and brand recognition than we do. In addition, some of the procedures offered by our competitors have broad market acceptance with our target customers and their patients. 
Invasive and Minimally-Invasive Procedures 
Physicians currently perform a number of invasive surgical procedures for fat reduction and body contouring, including liposuction, abdominoplasty (tummy tucks), gluteoplasty (buttock lifts), brachioplasty (arm lift), thighplasty (thigh lift), lower rhytidectomy (neck lift) and mentoplasty (chin). Laser-assisted liposuction, laser lipolysis, ultrasound lipolysis and injection lipolysis are minimally-invasive alternatives for fat reduction and body contouring. These minimally-invasive procedures require the physician to surgically insert a cannula, or metal tube, into the area to be treated and to use heat or ultrasound energy from the cannula to damage fat cells. Patients who are obese and require significant fat reduction to achieve aesthetic results are candidates for invasive and minimally-invasive procedures. Although effective at reducing a significant amount of fat, these invasive and minimally-invasive procedures present the following limitations: 


• | Surgical risks. All invasive and minimally-invasive procedures disrupt the skin's barrier function and therefore may increase risks of infection, local or widespread scarring, perforation, and hemorrhage. These procedures generally require a general or local anesthesia, which carries additional risks.


• | Pain and downtime. Invasive procedures may involve pain and may require weeks of post-surgical recovery. As a result, patients may need to spend significant time away from work and take prescribed pain medications for extended periods of time post-surgery. In addition, body lifts may severely limit muscle movement in the treated area during recovery, which can limit a patient's mobility for a significant period of time. Minimally-invasive procedures require a surgical incision or multiple injections, and may cause patient pain. Patients generally require at least two days or more of recovery time after a minimally-invasive procedure, which may require the patient to miss work and necessitate prescribed pain medications post-surgery.


• | Potentially undesired results. Invasive procedures may cause non-uniform fat reduction, dimpling, lumpiness, numbness, scarring, discoloration, or sagging skin in the treated area. Follow-up surgeries may be required to correct these problems. Minimally-invasive procedures can cause skin or tissue damage if, among other things, the physician does not carefully control the heat or ultrasound energy delivered in the treatment area.


• | Physician skill and technique dependent. The aesthetic results achieved through invasive and minimally-invasive procedures are dependent upon a physician's skill and training, which can vary from physician to physician. In addition, these procedures require a significant amount of direct physician time to perform.


• | High cost. Invasive and minimally-invasive procedures can be significantly more expensive for patients than non-invasive aesthetic procedures. In addition, there is an opportunity cost for physicians as these procedures require direct physician involvement and supervision.

 Non-Invasive Procedures 
Patients who do not require significant fat reduction to achieve aesthetic results may explore non-invasive fat reduction and body contouring procedures to avoid the pain, expense, downtime, and surgical risks associated with invasive and minimally-
6

invasive procedures. Existing non-invasive procedures used for body contouring or fat reduction, other than CoolSculpting, currently include those based on various forms of energy, including radiofrequency, laser, or ultrasound. Although these procedures are generally safer and less expensive than invasive and minimally-invasive procedures, these procedures have the following limitations when compared to CoolSculpting: 

• | Limited, inconsistent, and unpredictable results. We believe existing non-invasive procedures have limited efficacy and produce inconsistent fat reduction results. In addition, these procedures are not capable of selectively targeting fat cells, which can lead to unpredictable results, including damage to surrounding tissue.


• | Multiple steps required. Existing non-invasive procedures based on radio frequency or laser energy often require multiple steps spread over several weeks before the patient obtains noticeable aesthetic results, requiring the patient to schedule and coordinate multiple, time-consuming office visits.


• | Maintenance requirements. Some existing non-invasive procedures have only a temporary treatment effect, and thus require periodic maintenance treatments to sustain the desired aesthetic results.


• | Technique dependent. Existing non-invasive procedures often require highly trained personnel to conduct the treatment. Poor technique may lead to reduced efficacy and inconsistent aesthetic results.


• | Pain. Energy based products that utilize heat to destroy fat cells are associated with significant procedural pain and discomfort. Patients may require pain medications to tolerate the procedure. Pain management considerations may complicate the procedure and impose additional risks associated with pain medications.

Our Solution 
CoolSculpting is a non-invasive fat reduction procedure that is clinically proven to be safe and effective and provides most patients with noticeable and measurable aesthetic results. CoolSculpting utilizes our proprietary controlled cooling technology to selectively reduce stubborn fat bulges. CoolSculpting is based on the scientific principle that fat cells are more sensitive to cold than the overlying skin and surrounding tissues. CoolSculpting precisely cools the targeted fat bulge, and is designed to eliminate fat cells through a natural biological process known as apoptosis, without causing scar tissue or damage to the skin, nerves, or surrounding tissues. 
We believe that CoolSculpting provides the following benefits to our customers and their patients: 

• | Clinically proven, consistent, and durable results. Clinical studies involving more than 300 patients demonstrate that a single CoolSculpting procedure can noticeably and measurably reduce the fat layer within a treated fat bulge without requiring diet or exercise. In our pivotal U.S. clinical trial involving 60 patients, physicians were able to accurately differentiate between pre- and post-treatment photographs in 88% of the patients. Patients typically notice results as soon as three weeks following the CoolSculpting procedure, with the most dramatic results occurring over a period of two to four months for most patients. Because the fat layer in the treated area is reduced by eliminating fat cells that will not be replaced by the body, we believe the aesthetic benefits patients achieve in the treated area will be durable.


• | Safety profile. CoolSculpting selectively targets fat cells. Our proprietary treatment algorithms are designed to sufficiently cool the fat cells in the treated area to obtain the desired aesthetic results while preserving the skin and surrounding tissues. We designed the CoolSculpting system to constantly monitor the controlled cooling process and to automatically terminate the procedure if it detects any errors and warm the treated area if the detected temperature falls below our cooling algorithms. As of December 31, 2016, we have shipped 3.9 million cycles. To date, approximately 4,943 clinical complaints have been reported to us, representing 0.10% of all cycles. The most common clinical complaints relate to pain associated with the procedure, as well as common side effects, such as redness and edema. Medical Device Reports were filed when we believed reporting requirements were met.


• | Patient satisfaction. CoolSculpting allows most patients to achieve noticeable and measurable aesthetic results without the pain, expense, downtime, and risks associated with invasive and minimally-invasive procedures for fat reduction. In addition, unlike many other non-invasive procedures, patients are not required to undergo multiple treatment procedures or adopt special diet or exercise programs following the procedure to obtain aesthetic results. Patients have the flexibility to undergo a CoolSculpting procedure discreetly, scheduling an appointment for the procedure in the morning before work, during a lunch break, or in the evening. In our pivotal clinical study, 82% of the participating patients reported satisfaction with the CoolSculpting procedure. As a further indication of patient satisfaction, our customers reported that 45% of their patients returned for an additional CoolSculpting treatment, according to the market research study we commissioned through Easton Associates.


• | Repeatability enabled by natural biological process. CoolSculpting is designed to reduce the fat layer in the treated area through apoptosis, a natural biological process that leads to gradual elimination of the fat cells from the body. Unlike other treatment methods, we designed CoolSculpting to avoid triggering the body's wound-healing response, which can lead to the formation of scar tissue. As a result, patients can elect to have the CoolSculpting procedure repeated multiple times on the same treatment area if they desire further fat reduction. Because fat cells are gradually eliminated from the body

7

following a CoolSculpting treatment over a three to 16 week period, we recommend that patients wait at least six weeks before repeating a CoolSculpting procedure on the same treatment area.

• | Reproducible results. The CoolSculpting procedure requires limited training and skill to obtain successful aesthetic results. We designed the CoolSculpting system to be easy to operate and largely automated which results in a more consistent application and reproducible results. Once the procedure is started, the clinician is not required to monitor or make any adjustments to the CoolSculpting system during the balance of the procedure.


• | Differentiated, high-value product for physician practices. Our selective distribution strategy is designed to enable our customers to market CoolSculpting as a highly differentiated, non-invasive fat reduction procedure. Based on our commercial data and customer experiences, we have seen attractive economic benefits for our customers. In addition, the clinician is not required to administer the procedure and can see and treat other patients or perform concurrent procedures, such as injections or other dermal treatments, on the same patient during the CoolSculpting procedure.


• | Ability to expand the aesthetic market. Through market research we have confirmed there is strong consumer demand for a non-invasive procedure that can address the aesthetic concerns of individuals who have stubborn fat bulges. During the third quarter of 2013, we conducted quantitative survey of 3,515 adults in the United States through Berglas Research, an independent marketing research company, and were able to project that more than 85 million consumers were considered aesthetically-oriented and qualify for CoolSculpting. Among this group and based on this study, we projected that 22.4 million consumers would be interested in learning more about the CoolSculpting procedure after reading the product description. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted another quantitative survey of 3,261 adults in the United States through Quintessent Marketing, an independent marketing research company, and were able to project that more than 106 million consumers are considered aesthetically-oriented and qualify for CoolSculpting. Among this group and based on this study, we projected that 28.6 million consumers would be interested in learning more about the CoolSculpting procedure after reading the product description. The ASAPS reported 161,000 non-invasive fat reduction procedures in 2015. When we compare our potential audience to the number of procedures conducted we find that our market penetration is lower than 1%. Additionally, according to a separate market research study we commissioned through Easton Associates in 2011, our customers participating in the study reported that 30% of their CoolSculpting patients were aesthetic first-time users. Based on these results, we believe our customers will be able to target the aesthetic first-time user market and expand their aesthetic practice due to CoolSculpting's appeal.

Our Strategy 
Our goal is to become a leading medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing our proprietary controlled cooling technology platform. To achieve this goal, we intend to: 

• | Selectively market and sell our CoolSculpting system. With CoolSculpting established as a highly differentiated treatment we plan to continue to market and sell our CoolSculpting system to dermatologists, plastic surgeons, aesthetic specialists and general practice physicians. Some of our target practice sites have purchased or may elect to purchase more than one CoolSculpting system. Our sales force and distributors target dermatologists, plastic surgeons, aesthetic specialists and general practice physicians who have practices focused on aesthetic procedures and who express a willingness to position CoolSculpting as a differentiated treatment and participate in our practice marketing and support programs.


• | Deliver a focused and efficient marketing strategy. Our marketing strategy is designed to accelerate revenue while reducing overall sales and marketing spend through establishing co-operative customer partnerships and a direct-to-consumer program. This model has enabled our customers to leverage their local-market knowledge to create tailored, local patient marketing programs, with strong digital emphasis, to achieve greater awareness and demand. We intend to expand our co-operative customer partnership program in 2017. We also have a 5-step practice marketing program designed to help practices leverage established best practices relating to patient and staff treatments, front desk operations and internal and external marketing. At the core of this 5-step program is Treatment-to-Transformation, or T2T, a customized assessment and treatment protocol, which has revolutionized the way our customers use CoolSculpting to deliver improved outcomes and high patient satisfaction. We believe this clinical protocol has been instrumental in improving our system utilization and driving incremental system sales in existing practices. Its adoption was and continues to be a significant contributor to our current and long-term growth objectives.


• | Leverage data and customer insights. During 2013 and 2014, we launched our connectivity and data management tool, CoolConnect, across our installed base to collect real-time sales, demographic and marketing data that we believe can further optimize marketing strategies for both us and our customers. CoolConnect is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, of HIPPA, and the information derived from CoolConnect provides valuable trends and insights to our Practice Development Managers, or PDMs, showing both account-level treatment information and comparisons against peer-group counterparts within the same geographic area. We also leveraged our 2013 customer segmentation research to hone our messaging targeted towards consumers, and we have implemented a consistent creative strategy based on these insights.

• | Highly optimized, experienced and fully trained sales force. Our North American sales force is a bifurcated organization that has produced stronger focus and results on system sales and high-margin consumable sales. This organization is split between Area Sales Managers (ASMs), who focus on system sales, and Practice Development Managers (PDMs), who focus on assisting practices to market CoolSculpting to patients, product training and driving system utilization. We have continued to hire high quality, experienced sales representatives and sales management personnel in both categories and train the sales organization to optimize performance in their respective roles. This initiative has resulted in improved system placements to both existing and new practices, as well as increased system utilization, contributing to our recent revenue growth. We believe our sales force will continue to generate increased customer adoption and patient awareness momentum in the marketplace. We also believe that our focus on driving system utilization will offer the opportunity to drive increased sales of our high gross margin procedure packs.


• | Increase utilization of CoolSculpting through our marketing and customer support programs. We are driving demand for CoolSculpting procedures through our marketing and customer support programs. Through our PDMs we provide our customers with training on patient assessments, how to apply the CoolSculpting technology, practice development and marketing support to help our customers make CoolSculpting a key offering within their practices. We also intend to continue our co-operative marketing strategy with individual practices which is designed to encourage our customers to promote CoolSculpting to their aesthetic patients and those outside of their practices. To further support our customized marketing approach, we created the ZELTIQ Training Centers where we hold our training program, CoolSculpting University, or CSU. CSU is focused on customer training and education programs to optimize patient outcomes. In 2016, we hosted over 2,300 medical professionals from 1,035 offices worldwide at our CSU programs. This program invites practices to attend hands-on training where they learn the proper techniques for T2T, including a complete treatment assessment, applicator placement and patient consultation. Customers are also trained on a specific practice enhancement execution protocols designed to accelerate utilization and maximize the use of their CoolSculpting offering that includes branding, grassroots initiatives and digital marketing tactics. To address the demand for this training from our customers we currently have one training center in Pleasanton, California which we opened in 2013, and a second center in Reston, Virginia, which we opened in the second quarter of 2015. Our PDMs then visit customers in the field to further customize and optimize the program at a local level to ensure it is delivering improved patient flow. We believe this program is particularly well suited to the aesthetics industry. We also intend to continue to participate in industry trade shows, clinical workshops, and company-sponsored conferences with expert panelists. 


• | Increase our international presence. There is strong global demand for aesthetic procedures outside of North America. We intend to increase our market penetration outside of North America and build global brand recognition. We have received regulatory approval or are otherwise free to market CoolSculpting in numerous international markets, where use of the product is generally not limited to specific treatment areas. Our customers in these markets commonly perform CoolSculpting procedures on the back and chest, in addition to the flanks, abdomen, thigh, upper arm, submental area, around the bra straps and underneath the buttocks. We intend to seek regulatory approval to market CoolSculpting in additional international markets, as well as grow our international sales and marketing organization to focus on increasing sales and strengthening our customer relationships. As part of that strategy, we are and intend to continue to opportunistically deploy a direct sales force in select international markets.


• | Expand our FDA-cleared indications for CoolSculpting. We currently have FDA clearance to market CoolSculpting in the United States for the visible reduction of fat in the flanks, an area commonly known as the “love handles”, abdomen, thigh, upper arm, and back, as well as around the bra straps, under the buttocks and the in submental area under the chin. We intend to continue to seek additional regulatory clearances from the FDA to expand our United States marketable indications for CoolSculpting to other areas on the body.


• | Leverage our technology platform. We are exploring additional uses of our proprietary controlled cooling technology platform for the dermatology, plastic surgery, aesthetic and general practice markets. We are also exploring potential therapeutic uses for our platform technology, either directly or through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners.


• | Streamline our R&D focus and capital deployment. Our R&D efforts and associated capital deployment have been streamlined to focus on making the CoolSculpting procedure safer, more comfortable, faster and more efficacious. Our research is focused on optimizing the patient outcome and increasing practice efficiency by reducing treatment duration. In the long-term, we remain focused on leveraging our proprietary cooling technology into new applications and indications for CoolSculpting to treat acne and into areas with a smaller volume of fat on the body.

The CoolSculpting Experience 
Patient Consultation 
The first step of the CoolSculpting process is a patient consultation. We designed our CoolSculpting system to address the aesthetic concerns of individuals who are not considered obese but have stubborn fat bulges. Utilizing our PDMs and CSU program, we train our customers to properly identify those patients who would be good candidates for CoolSculpting and educate their patients on the aesthetic results they should expect from a CoolSculpting procedure. We also instruct our customers to explain to their patients the natural process of fat cell elimination triggered by a CoolSculpting procedure, so that they understand the expected time period before they will notice the full aesthetic results as well as the potential to repeat the procedure for additional aesthetic results. While some patients may notice results as soon as three weeks following a CoolSculpting procedure, the full aesthetic results are generally achieved over a period of two to four months following treatment. Because we believe the consultation process is an important step in ensuring patients are pleased with their CoolSculpting procedure, we encourage our customers to personally conduct the patient consultation. 
The CoolSculpting Procedure 
CoolSculpting is a non-invasive procedure that is clinically proven to be safe and effective and provides most patients with noticeable and measurable aesthetic results. Once the desired treatment area has been identified, the clinician applies our consumable CoolGel to the skin surface of the treatment area to ensure consistent thermal contact and to protect the skin from freezing. The CoolSculpting applicator is then positioned on the treatment area over the CoolGel, and the fat bulge is drawn into the applicator and positioned between its cooling panels. In the case of our CoolSmooth applicator, a non-suction based applicator is secured by disposable securement accessories. Once the applicator is affixed on the treatment area, no further clinician intervention is required for the duration of the procedure. The rate of the controlled cooling is modulated by thermoelectric cooling elements and controlled by sensors in the applicator that monitor the cooling of the fat bulge. Just prior to the end of the procedure, the CoolSculpting system signals the clinician that the treatment is ending. When the procedure is completed, the CoolSculpting system automatically terminates the cooling, and the clinician then removes the CoolSculpting applicator from the treatment area. 
Patient Experience 
Our surveys indicate that most patients find the CoolSculpting procedure easy to tolerate. Generally, anesthesia and pain medications are not required before, during, or after a CoolSculpting procedure. Patients feel a tugging sensation from the suction created when the CoolSculpting applicator (other than our CoolSmooth applicator) is placed on the treatment area. At the onset of the procedure, patients also experience a chilling sensation in the treatment area that subsides after a few minutes, as the cooling produces an anesthetic effect. Patients can talk on their cell phones, read, listen to music, work on their laptop, relax, or sleep during the procedure. 
After completion of a CoolSculpting procedure, patients may resume their normal activities, including work and exercise. CoolSculpting patients generally do not experience any significant adverse side effects. 
Our CoolSculpting System 
We generate revenue primarily from sales of our CoolSculpting system and from sales of consumables to our customers. Sales of systems can include sales of systems to new customers that include our entire suite of applicators, as well as multi-system sales to new customers or sales to existing customers which may not include the entire suite of applicators. Additionally, some practices may purchase additional applicators, or add-on applicators, for existing systems. We generate consumable revenue through sales of cycles in the form of consumable procedure packs, each of which includes our consumable CoolGels, CoolLiners, Geltraps and in the case of our CoolSmooth procedure packs, disposable securement accessories, all of which are used by our customer during treatments. In addition, each consumable procedure pack includes a disposable computer cartridge that we market as the CoolCard. The CoolCard contains enabling software that permits our customers to perform a fixed number of CoolSculpting procedures, or cycles.
We also announced the launch of a new CoolMini-only system, providing physicians with the option to purchase a system that only comes with the CoolMini applicator which was specifically designed to treat smaller pockets of fat, including the submental fat area, or "double chin." We began offering this new configuration in the first quarter of 2016, enabling us to target physicians that primarily or exclusively focus on facial aesthetic treatments. The system can be upgraded with the purchase of additional software and applicators. With these individually purchased upgrades, the system has the ability to treat other body areas.
CoolSculpting Control Unit 
10

The CoolSculpting control unit is the base of the CoolSculpting system and contains the simple user interface, power management and control functions, and chiller unit that is responsible for the controlled cooling. Our CoolSculpting control unit also contains a HIPAA compliant connectivity and data management tool that locally tracks and collects data about each procedure performed as well as any error messages that may be generated during the procedure. We can collect and analyze this information to help our customers better understand their usage patterns and improve their marketing plans, utilization, and profitability, as well as troubleshoot and resolve issues remotely. 
Additionally, the CoolSculpting control unit features: (1) a color touchscreen which provides operators with clear visual directions to initiate a CoolSculpting procedure, continuous status updates, and easy to follow notifications or corrective actions in the rare event of a procedure interruption; (2) vents which provide airflow and reduce heat build-up allowing our CoolSculpting system to be used in a standard physician treatment room without any special ventilation requirements or room modifications; (3) a drawer which provides storage space for our CoolSculpting CoolGels, CoolLiners, Geltraps and user documentation; and (4) the unit is mobile, allowing a physician to easily transfer the CoolSculpting unit between treatment rooms and reach different treatment areas on a patient.
CoolSculpting Applicators 
The CoolSculpting applicator: (1) delivers vacuum suction and cooling to the fat bulge being treated; (2) can be used to start and stop a CoolSculpting procedure and to turn the vacuum suction on and off; and, (3) has a thermoelectric cooling panel with temperature and pressure sensors which provide precise thermal control and monitoring of the fat bulge being treated and will automatically stop the procedure if a problem is detected. In the case of our CoolSmooth applicator, which is a non-suction based applicator, the applicator is secured by disposable securement accessories.

With the launch of our CoolAdvantage and CoolAdvantage Plus applicators in June and December 2016, respectively, we currently offer eight CoolSculpting applicators for use with our CoolSculpting system. Each CoolSculpting applicator is designed to allow the physician to treat a different size and shape fat bulge. 

1. | CoolCore - designed for use on small and medium fat bulges.


2. | CoolMax - designed for use on larger fat bulges.


3. | CoolCurve+ - designed to fit tightly curved contours.


4. | CoolFit - designed for use on long, narrow fat bulges.


5. | CoolSmooth Pro - designed for use on non-pinchable fat bulges.


6. | CoolMini - designed to address smaller fat bulges, including the submental area under the chin.


7. | CoolAdvantage and CoolAdvantage Plus - designed to reduce treatment time by nearly half compared to our existing applicators mentioned above; CoolAdvantage features an adaptable 3-in-1 configuration and enhanced cup design to address medium fat bulges, and CoolAdvantage Plus is designed to address larger fat bulges.

 CoolSculpting Procedure Packs 
A CoolCard is required to operate the CoolSculpting control unit and is programmed with enabling software that permits the CoolSculpting control unit to perform a fixed number of procedures, or cycles. In addition, each CoolCard is programmed with an encrypted security certificate that prevents the performance of a CoolSculpting procedure unless the CoolCard is recognized and authenticated by the specific CoolSculpting control unit and CoolSculpting applicator. The security certificate is designed to ensure that customers pay for each CoolSculpting procedure and prevent the use of counterfeit CoolCards. Our consumable CoolGels are cotton sheets saturated in a solution that protects the skin and ensures proper thermal coupling during a CoolSculpting procedure. One CoolGel is required for each treated area and is not reusable. Our consumable plastic CoolLiners and Geltraps protect the applicator from gel contact. One CoolLiner is recommended per patient for hygienic reasons. In the case of our CoolSmooth procedure packs, the applicator is secured by disposable securement accessories.

Our Technology 
Our Technology Platform 
Our controlled cooling technology platform is based on the scientific principle that cooling can be delivered safely and non-invasively to achieve specific biological outcomes, selectively affecting certain cells, tissues, or structures in and below the skin. The ability to predict and control the impact of cold exposure by developing algorithms to control the rate and period of the cooling is well established in the field of cryobiology and cryogenic medicine. Moderate cold has been demonstrated to trigger cellular apoptosis (programmed cell death), whereas more extreme cold causes uncontrolled cell death. Additionally, certain cells and tissue types exhibit particular sensitivity or resistance to cold injury. This principle enables the selective elimination of certain cells or tissues via a desired biologic pathway using precise cooling temperatures. In addition, the function of certain biological systems can be affected by cold exposure. Cold is known to reduce nerve conduction, and can produce either a transient or a prolonged interruption in nerve function depending on the specific thermal parameters applied. We believe the ability to control tissue effects by modulating the cooling algorithm with our technology platform enables multiple potential therapeutic applications in addition to our CoolSculpting fat reduction application. 
Our CoolSculpting Technology 
Our CoolSculpting technology utilizes the sensitivity of fat cells to cold injury to selectively eliminate subcutaneous fat tissue without affecting the skin or other surrounding tissues. Termed Cryolipolysis®, this technology enables a non-invasive alternative for subcutaneous fat reduction through cellular apoptosis. Cellular apoptosis is a normally occurring biological process whereby cells are eliminated as part of normal cell turnover. When injurious external stimuli (such as cold) are applied to a target cell, the apoptotic process may be triggered. If triggered, the injured cell consequently enters an orderly, regulated process of gradual degradation into smaller bodies which are absorbed by the body's immune system over time. This pathway to cellular elimination is in contrast to cellular necrosis, or uncontrolled cell death, in which an acute injury to the cell leads to lysis of the cell. Cellular necrosis triggers an aggressive inflammatory response leading to fibrotic scar tissue formation, which is not observed with cellular apoptosis. The cold treatment algorithm implemented by the CoolSculpting technology is designed to trigger apoptosis, eliminating fat cells without generating a wound healing reaction. 
The CoolSculpting technology has been clinically demonstrated to cause reductions in fat layer thickness without impacting the skin or other tissues or structures in the treatment area. Fat cells are particularly sensitive to cold injury due to their composition; they contain a large lipid droplet within the cell membrane which constitutes the majority of the cell's volume. When cooled, lipids crystallize (undergo phase transition to an ordered molecular state) at a temperature well above the freezing point of water. Exposure of fat cells to these moderately cold temperatures causes the lipid droplets to crystallize, causing a subtle molecular injury which triggers the apoptotic sequence. However, the cooling does not affect cell types without high lipid content, preserving the health of the epidermis, dermis, and the underlying tissue. The interactions between cold and different cell and tissue types have been investigated extensively in scientific studies and are well documented in the literature. 
A simplified description of the CoolSculpting process is as follows: 

1. | Cooling applicator is applied and the fat bulge being treated is suctioned into the applicator head (unless our CoolSmooth applicator is being used, in which case it is secured by disposable securement accessories).


2. | Subcutaneous fat in the treatment area is precisely cooled at a rate that does not cause scar tissue or damage to the skin, nerves, or surrounding tissues.


3. | Maintained cooling causes lipid crystallization in the fat cells and triggers apoptosis of the fat cells.


4. | Patient's natural immune response leads to gradual elimination of the fat cells, resulting in a reduction in the fat layer thickness and an improvement in the appearance of the treated fat bulge.

Clinical History and Development of CoolSculpting 
The founding principles of controlled cooling for the non-invasive and selective reduction of fat cells were originated at the Wellman Center for Photomedicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital, or MGH, a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School. CoolSculpting’s core technology was developed by Harvard scientists Dr. R. Rox Anderson and Dr. Deiter Manstein, two pioneers in the aesthetic industry. Researchers at MGH were prompted by published reports of cold-induced panniculitis, or inflammation of subcutaneous adipose tissue, in a syndrome frequent in young children called popsicle panniculitis, whereby inflammation of the fatty tissue in the lower cheek occurred after children sucked for a prolonged time on frozen treats. Clinical reports of popsicle panniculitis suggested that human adipose tissue may be preferentially damaged by exposure to cold. Based on these reports, research scientists at MGH conducted further research and patented certain aspects of Cryolipolysis technology. In May 2005, we secured an exclusive, worldwide license to the Cryolipolysis technology developed at MGH. 
Following our licensing of the Cryolipolysis technology from MGH, we initiated animal and human clinical testing to support the development of the CoolSculpting procedure. These scientific studies used objective endpoints, including histologic and ultrasound assessments and outcome evaluation by blinded, independent panel review, and provided evidence of the safety and 
12

efficacy of the CoolSculpting procedure. As of December 31, 2016, there were over 75 peer-reviewed scientific journal articles and published conference abstracts discussing the effects of our CoolSculpting technology, both by physicians affiliated with our company as clinical and scientific advisers, as well as by independent investigators. 

Preclinical Studies 
We conducted animal testing primarily in pig models. In the original MGH studies, Manstein et al. investigated the feasibility of Cryolipolysis, established correlations between cold treatment parameters (temperature, time) and fat reduction, and evaluated the impact on serum lipid levels in Yucatan pigs (see Manstein D, Laubach H, Watanabe K, et al: Selective cryolysis: A novel method of non-invasive fat removal. Lasers Surg Med 40:595-604, 2009). All sites treated with cold exposure less than -1°C developed panniculitis and fat layer reduction. No significant changes in the lipid profiles of the animals were noted immediately post-treatment or at any time point studied. 
A subsequent study was performed by Zelickson et al. (see Zelickson B, Egbert BM, Preciado J, et al: Cryolipolysis for non-invasive fat cell destruction: Initial results from a pig model. Dermatol Surg 35:1462-1470, 2009). In this study, three pigs underwent a single Cryolipolysis treatment, while the fourth pig underwent seven treatments with the Cryolipolysis device at different time points before euthanasia. Histopathology demonstrated an approximate reduction of 50% in the thickness of the superficial fat layer. No adverse impact on the skin was observed and lipid panels revealed no significant variations in lipid profiles at any time in the study. 
Clinical Studies 
We have conducted multiple institutional review board-approved (IRB-approved), non-significant risk human clinical studies to assess the use of controlled cooling for selective fat reduction. 

Pre-abdominoplasty study. An initial exploratory human clinical study of Cryolipolysis was performed at a single site in the United States on 180 patients. In this study, patients who were scheduled to undergo abdominoplasty were treated with our technology in the lower abdomen at different intervals up to 180 days prior to their scheduled surgery date. At the time of abdominoplasty, the treated tissue was excised and processed for histologic evaluation. There were no significant changes in the fat tissue at seven days post-treatment, relative to the untreated control. This supports that controlled cooling triggers an apoptotic mechanism of fat cell elimination, as this process occurs gradually and is not evident immediately after cold exposure. At 14 days post-treatment, infiltration of immune cells (macrophages) were observed in the fat layer, as indicated by intense nuclei staining. These cells are responsible for the removal of the apoptotic fat cells via phagocytosis. At 90 days post-treatment, the fibrous septae (connective tissue fibers) in the fat layer were condensed due to elimination of fat cells. There was no evidence of dermal, epidermal, nerve, or blood vessel inflammation, and there was no evidence of fibrosis (scar tissue formation). 

Pivotal study. To support our 510(k) notification for the use of CoolSculpting for non-invasive fat reduction of the flanks, commonly referred to as the love handles, we completed a prospective, multi-center U.S. human clinical trial in 2007. A total of 60 patients were treated at 12 dermatology or plastic surgery centers in the United States. Follow-up periods for both safety and efficacy were at two and six months. An additional one-week assessment was performed via telephone interview to document potential side effects. The primary endpoint was assessed on the basis of blinded, independent panel review of photographs. Patients were treated with our technology for 30 to 60 minutes. Patients were treated on one flank only to aid in the assessment of the primary endpoint. Outcomes were assessed via photographs, ultrasound measurements, and patient satisfaction questionnaires. 
Primary endpoint. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the correct identification of the series of pre-treatment images versus six-month post-treatment images by the three independent physician reviewers who specialize in dermatology or plastic surgery. High resolution digital photographs were made of the patients' abdomens at specific degrees of rotation. The physicians were blinded to the identification of which photograph corresponded to the baseline image. Each reviewer was then asked to determine which photograph corresponded to the baseline photograph series and record their selections onto individual data collection forms. Intra-rater consistency among reviewers was determined by the inclusion of repeat sets. The order in which the patients were presented to the reviewer was randomized; within each patient, the set presentation was also randomized (e.g., left or right side of the presentation slide). It was expected that the percentage of correct identification of the pre-treatment images would be at least 80% based on past identification rates. 

For all patients, regardless of weight change during the study period, reviewers were able to correctly identify baseline photos in 88% of the cases. Because fluctuations in weight can confound photo identifications, the primary endpoint outcome was also calculated for the patients who maintained their weight within five pounds of their baseline weight, and found that the correct identification percentage rose to 92%. These results suggest that clinically-meaningful changes were produced in the vast majority of patients regardless of subsequent weight change.

Secondary endpoints. The study also evaluated the following secondary outcome measures: reduction in the fat layer thickness as demonstrated by comparison of pre-treatment and post-treatment ultrasound measurements and patient satisfaction as determined by the results of a patient satisfaction questionnaire at the six-month follow-up visit. Standardized techniques for obtaining ultrasound images were developed and validated to ensure consistency throughout the study. A percent change in fat layer thickness was determined for an untreated area of the abdomen to account for patient weight variation during the study. A percent change in fat layer thickness was determined for the treated area to account for fat layer thickness reduction due to fat cell elimination through Cryolipolysis and patient weight variation during the study. Fat layer thickness changes were normalized for each patient by subtracting the percent change in fat layer thickness in the untreated area from the percent change in fat layer thickness in the treated area to remove the influence of weight variations.
Ultrasound results demonstrated a mean reduction in the fat layer of 19% for the entire study population. These fat layer reductions were statistically significant as compared to the control region. Since the pivotal study, we have continued to enhance and optimize the CoolSculpting procedure. The CoolSculpting algorithms used during the pivotal study used a lower CIF (Cooling Intensity Factor) and/or shorter treatment times than the algorithm currently in commercial use with our CoolSculpting system. As a result, we believe the average percentage fat layer reduction produced by our current commercial version of the CoolSculpting system may exceed the percentage fat layer reduction measured by ultrasound in our pivotal study. Patient surveys showed that 82% of the participants were satisfied with the CoolSculpting procedure, and 79% agreed that there was a noticeable improvement in the appearance of their treated fat bulge. 
Safety results. Treatment sites were evaluated immediately after treatment and at subsequent follow-up visits. Evidence of local inflammation was anticipated after a CoolSculpting treatment based on the body's reaction to a cold stimulus, and resolved spontaneously in all cases. Erythema, in most cases minor or moderate, was seen immediately post-treatment in virtually all patients. However, this condition had resolved itself within one week in the large majority of cases (93%). Purpura/bruising occurred in 27% of patients after the procedure was performed, and by the one week assessment had resolved in all but 5% of the patients. Minor or moderate edema was reported in only 13% of patients immediately after the procedure, and had universally resolved within a week. Numbness was common immediately after the CoolSculpting procedure, occurring in 87%. A week later only approximately half of the patients still experienced some degree of numbness (in no case marked), and by two months only 7% still had numbness; in all cases it was mild. At the six-month follow-up visit, no patient complained of numbness or tingling. 
Blood was drawn from a subset of patients (n=10) for evaluation of serum lipids and liver tests. The mean values in all patient groups show no trends over time and there were no clinically meaningful differences between baseline and post-treatment values. 
A total of four adverse events were reported in our pivotal study. Two involved pain during the initial cooling exposure; in both cases treatment was discontinued. These events resolved without intervention approximately one week after treatment. One patient reported bruising in the treated area one-day post treatment. Resolution was documented at an optional follow-up conducted four weeks post treatment. The fourth adverse event involved a report of pain and muscle spasm in the treatment area rated as a one (minor in severity) occurring once a month for three months. In a follow-up visit three weeks after the complaint, the patient stated the muscle spasm had resolved and the patient did not feel that the spasms were related to the treatment. None of the adverse events reported during this study were considered serious. 
Conclusions. The clinical findings of our pivotal study confirmed the safety and effectiveness of our CoolSculpting technology and procedure. Photographic review and ultrasound measurements demonstrated clinically significant and measurable reductions in the fat layer thickness in the treated area. Independent photo review of baseline and post-treatment images (the primary endpoint) yielded a correct identification percentage exceeding the 80% criteria, and a statistically significant achievement of the success criteria. No serious adverse events were reported. Side effects and adverse events were typically mild and transient and all resolved spontaneously without medical intervention. Post-treatment lipid profile and liver function test results exhibited only normal variations with no discernible difference from baseline. Patient survey results supported overall patient satisfaction with the treatment.

Research and Development 
Our ongoing research and development activities are primarily focused on improving and enhancing our CoolSculpting system and the CoolSculpting procedure. Our research and development efforts related to CoolSculpting currently include: 

• | Additional treatment indications. We intend to seek additional regulatory clearances from the FDA to expand our marketed indications for CoolSculpting in the United States to other areas of the body.


• | Additional applicators. We are developing additional applicators for the CoolSculpting system to expand our range of available applicator sizes and configurations, which will provide our customers with additional flexibility in selecting the applicator that best fits the body contour to be treated. In 2015, with our recent FDA clearance for lower temperatures, we launched our CoolSmooth PRO applicator in the second quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we introduced our CoolMini applicator for treatment of smaller areas, including under the chin. We introduced our CoolAdvantage and CoolAdvantage Plus applicator in June and December 2016, respectively.


• | Enhanced algorithms. CoolSculpting utilizes our proprietary treatment algorithms to ensure the fat cells in the treated area are sufficiently cooled to obtain the desired aesthetic results while preserving the overlying skin and surrounding tissues. We are continuing to examine the interaction between controlled cooling and tissue response to enhance our proprietary treatment algorithms.


• | Point of Sale information feature. Our CoolSculpting system currently records information locally at the unit level about each treatment procedure, including information regarding procedure and patient statistics. Our direct sales force and our distributors can collect this information for analysis. With CoolConnect, which is a HIPAA compliant connectivity and data management tool, we are able to accumulate and analyze treatment procedure information at the point of sale. These data points assist our sales force in discussions with customers regarding their marketing efforts and program effectiveness. CoolConnect continues to be used across our installed base to collect real-time sales, demographic and marketing data that we believe can further optimize marketing strategies for both us and our customers. This information provides valuable trends and insights to our PDMs showing both account-level treatment information and comparisons against peer-group counterparts within the same geographic area.


• | Procedure tracking. To help ensure we capture each procedure performed with our CoolSculpting system, we are continuing to optimize the security encryption in our CoolCards to protect against third-party manipulation or the use of counterfeit CoolCards with our CoolSculpting system.


• | Design improvements. We are continuing to optimize the design of our CoolSculpting system to improve reliability and to reduce our manufacturing and repair costs.


In addition to these development activities related to CoolSculpting, we are exploring additional uses of our proprietary controlled cooling technology platform for the dermatology, plastic surgery, aesthetic and general practice markets. We are also exploring potential therapeutic uses for our platform technology, either directly or through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners. Although MGH cannot restrict our future product development efforts, the terms of our license agreement with MGH may require us to pay MGH a royalty on commercial sales of future products we develop or that may be developed by our strategic partners. Whether we are required to pay a royalty will depend on whether our future products incorporate the intellectual property we license from MGH. Any royalty we are required to pay will reduce our profits from sales of such future products and may make it more difficult for us to successfully commercialize these products directly or through a strategic partner. 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 82 employees focused on research and development. In addition to our internal team, we retain third-party contractors from time to time to provide us with assistance on specialized projects. We also work closely with experts in the medical community to supplement our internal research and development resources. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were $25.5 million, $22.9 million and $18.2 million, respectively. 
Sales and Marketing 
Sales 
In North America, we utilize a direct sales force to sell CoolSculpting. As of December 31, 2016, we had a North American sales force of 171 employees. To support the continued roll-out of CoolSculpting, we intend to continue to invest in our North American sales force. 
15

In international markets, we sell CoolSculpting primarily through a network of distributors. As of December 31, 2016, we had an international sales team of 43 employees supporting approximately 47 independent distributors. Additionally, we utilize a separate direct sales force of 27 employees to sell into certain key markets in Europe. Our product currently has regulatory approval in 74 countries. We are increasing and intend to continue to increase penetration of our installed base in international markets in which CoolSculpting is currently sold and expand into attractive new international markets by identifying and training qualified distributors. We require our distributors to provide customer training, to invest in equipment and marketing, and to attend certain exhibitions and industry meetings. In addition, we are opportunistically pursuing direct sales and expanding our marketing campaigns in select international markets. 
We enter into distribution agreements with our distributors outside of North America. Our distribution agreements generally provide the distributor with a right to distribute our product for a limited period of time and are renewable by written agreement and terminable upon a material breach by either party, insolvency of the distributor, or a change of control of the distributor. Following the expiration or termination of the agreement, the distributor has an obligation to continue servicing existing customers for a period ranging from two to three months, upon our written request. Our distribution agreements generally provide the exclusive right to distribute our products within a designated territory, with certain distributors only receiving non-exclusive rights within a designated territory. We require distributors to purchase a minimum number of CoolSculpting systems each calendar quarter over the term of the agreement. The agreement sets forth the minimum quarterly purchase obligations for the first calendar year of the term of the agreement, and the parties will agree each year on the minimum quarterly purchase obligations for the remaining quarters during the term of the agreement. If the distributor fails to meet one of its minimum quarterly purchase obligations, we can convert the distributor to a non-exclusive distributor during the remaining term or terminate the agreement. These agreements also provide customary indemnities to the distributor including claims of patent infringement in the designated territory, material product defects, and our negligence or willful misconduct. 
Customers
No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of annual revenue in 2016 and 2014. One aesthetic chain, along with its affiliated franchises, accounted for 10% of revenue in 2015 and 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016. 
Customer Marketing and Support Programs 
We intend to drive CoolSculpting procedures through our targeted marketing and customer support programs. Since 2013, we have hired and trained a group of PDMs. Our PDMs train our customers on the use of the CoolSculpting system when the CoolSculpting system is first delivered to the customer's practice site. Following this initial training, our PDMs educate our customers on current CoolSculpting best practices and provide customers and their staff with sales and marketing training and support to help them increase patient demand for CoolSculpting procedures.
We also continue to offer a comprehensive practice certification program, originally launched in 2011. A customer's participation in this certification program and our other practice support programs, other than the initial training program, is voluntary. We have found that the most successful practices have the customer involved in every part of the training and marketing process. To become certified, customers must commit to engage in quarterly business strategy meetings with one of our PDMs, educate members of their office in our CoolSculpting best practices, and adopt our guidelines for before and after patient photographs. Once certified, customers receive distinction on our website. Furthermore, in late 2013 we launched the first of our customer training programs, CoolSculpting University. This program enables new and existing customers to successfully launch their CoolSculpting programs through a curriculum that includes hands-on education, live treatments and lecture-style presentations. In 2016, we hosted over 2,300 medical professionals from 1,035 offices worldwide at our CSU programs. To address the demand for this training from our customers we currently have one training center in Pleasanton, California which we opened in 2013, and a second center in Reston, Virginia, which we opened in the second quarter of 2015. Also, we hosted 19 satellite CSU programs internationally for the year ended December 31, 2016.
In addition, with the launch of our HIPAA compliant connectivity and data management tool, CoolConnect, across our installed base, we are able to collect real-time sales, demographic and marketing data that we believe can further optimize marketing strategies for both us and our customers. This information provides valuable trends and insights to our PDMs, showing both account-level treatment information and comparisons against peer-group counterparts within the same geographic area. We also leveraged our 2013 customer segmentation research to hone our messaging targeted towards consumers, and we have implemented a consistent creative strategy based on these insights. 
Direct-to-Consumer 
In 2016, we launched a national direct-to-consumer advertising program to build awareness and interest in the marketplace. The national campaign leveraged learnings from the successful direct-to-consumer pilots held in 11 U.S. cities: Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston, San Diego, Miami / Ft. Lauderdale, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Seattle, Washington, DC. 
16

CoolSculpting website traffic significantly increased in those markets, and local CoolSculpting providers experienced a significant increase in patient interest and treatments. The multiple channels we utilized included television commercials, radio spots, digital advertising, print advertising, out-of-home advertising, social media, and public relations. As of December 31, 2016, our program is active nationally in the U.S. 
Customer Support 
We strive to provide our customers and authorized distributors with superior customer support. We maintain a staff of Customer Care personnel in our facilities in Pleasanton, California and Reston, Virginia, as well as in the United Kingdom, to support our customers worldwide. This staff is available by telephone and email to field inquiries, troubleshoot product issues, facilitate sales activities and support the commercial activities of our international distributors. In addition, we provide worldwide technical support to our customers and distributors year round. Our goal is to minimize the disruption caused by a service event, and we strive to repair our customer's CoolSculpting system or provide the customer with a replacement CoolSculpting system within one day after notifying us of a problem. In the event of a technical issue with a CoolSculpting system, one of our Customer Care personnel will call the customer and determine whether the technical issue may be resolved over the telephone or whether the issue requires intervention. If the issue cannot be resolved by telephone, our Customer Care personnel will request our third-party logistics provider to ship and setup a replacement CoolSculpting system, or the applicable module of the CoolSculpting system, at the customer's office. To reduce shipping times and costs, we ensure that a number of CoolSculpting systems and replacement modules are available in specific regions throughout North America and other international locations. Upon arrival at the customer site, our logistics provider will move the replacement CoolSculpting system or module into the customer's office, unpack it, set it up and then power on the CoolSculpting system to ensure it is working properly. Because of the modular design of our CoolSculpting system, our logistics provider is not required to have any specialized training or expertise, and a number of logistics providers are available to provide these services. Upon completion, our logistics provider calls our Customer Care personnel and confirms the successful delivery and setup, and then ships the defective CoolSculpting system or module to our headquarters for repair. We allow our customers to keep the newly delivered CoolSculpting system or the applicable module, and in many cases we repair and reuse the defective CoolSculpting system or module received from our customer for future service calls. In the direct markets outside of North America and our Europe direct markets, our CoolSculpting system is serviced and supported through our independent distributors. We pro-actively deploy replacement CoolSculpting systems, modules, and components to strategic hubs worldwide to facilitate quick response time to service events and to maximize customer “uptime.” 
We provide a standard limited warranty on our products of one year for both control units and applicators for our direct customers. For indirect customers in international markets, we provide a standard limited warranty on our products of approximately three years for control units and one year for applicators. We also offer an extended warranty on both our CoolSculpting control units and CoolSculpting applicators. 
Manufacturing 
We occupy 34,176 square feet in our manufacturing facility in Dublin, California and 15,755 square feet of warehouse space in Livermore, California. We manufacture our CoolSculpting system and store raw materials at our Dublin facility. The Livermore facility is used for assembling our procedure packs and distribution of our CoolSculpting systems and procedure packs. In addition, in the third quarter of 2016 we began manufacturing CoolGels and CoolCards in our Galway, Ireland facility, which has a total of 47,880 square feet.    
We depend upon suppliers for some critical components of our manufacturing processes and for materials used in our manufacturing processes. Some of these components and materials are supplied by a single vendor, and some are subject to certain minimum order quantities. Generally, we rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with our suppliers, which subjects us to risks, including price increases and component shortages. We continue to evaluate alternative sources of supply for these components and materials.
CoolLiners, pretreatment wipes and other consumables continue to be manufactured by third-party manufacturers. In addition, our CoolSculpting system contains two critical components, the integrated circuit contained in the CoolSculpting control unit and the CoolCard, which is supplied by a company in Japan, and the connector that attaches our applicators to the control unit, which is supplied by a separate company in the United States. We do not have supply agreements with the suppliers of these critical components beyond purchase orders. However, we maintain a safety stock inventory for these critical components equal to one year of forecasted part requirements of the integrated circuit and one month of connectors in finished assemblies, as well as at least a three month supply of connectors to support open sales orders. 
Manufacturing facilities that produce finished medical devices intended for distribution in the United States and internationally are subject to regulation and periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. In the United States, we are required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, 
17

quality assurance, packaging, storage, and shipping of our products. The FDA inspected our Pleasanton facility in April 2011, April 2013 and March 2016, and had no findings or observations. In international markets, we are required to obtain and maintain various quality assurance and quality management certifications. We have obtained the following international certifications: EN ISO 13485:2012 Quality Management Systems Requirements for regulatory purposes, ISO 13485:2003 under CMDCAS (Canada), Ordinance 169 certification (Japan), 93/42/EEC MDD certification to Annex II Full Quality System (Europe). We have recently been audited by our Notified Body, TUV Rheinland, and all certifications have been extended to cover all of our facilities.
Neither our third-party contract manufacturers nor our suppliers are currently required to comply with the FDA's QSR, as these parties do not provide us with a finished medical device. However, we maintain a quality system designed to be compliant to QSR and have procedures in place designed to ensure that all products and materials purchased by us conform to specified requirements, including evaluation of suppliers, and where required, qualification of the components supplied. 
Our current facilities are adequate to support our near-term operations; however, they may not be sufficient in the long term. Leases for our manufacturing and warehouse locations expire in May 2017. In January 2017, we signed a six-year lease for a new manufacturing facility in Dublin, California in close proximity to our corporate headquarters, as well as a new warehouse facility lease (through January 2022) in Livermore, California. These new facilities are intended to replace our existing Dublin and Livermore facilities, which have leases that are set to expire in 2017.
Our business typically has a short sales cycle, and to date we have not had a significant backlog of orders at the end of any given quarter. We define backlog as unshipped orders resulting from lack of available product to fulfill non-cancelable sales orders.  
Competition 
The medical technology and aesthetic product markets are highly competitive and dynamic, and are characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. Demand for CoolSculpting could be limited by the products and technologies offered now or in the future by our competitors. We designed CoolSculpting to address the aesthetic concerns of individuals who have stubborn fat bulges. Although effective at reducing fat, invasive and minimally-invasive procedures may involve patient pain, expense, downtime, and the risks typically associated with surgical procedures. As a result, patients who do not require significant fat reduction to achieve meaningful aesthetic results explore non-invasive fat reduction and body contouring procedures to avoid the pain, expense, downtime, and surgical risks associated with invasive and minimally-invasive procedures.
In addition to the above invasive and minimally-invasive procedures, the FDA has also cleared the marketing of several noninvasive technologies for fat reduction, circumferential reduction, fat cell destruction or body contouring. These noninvasive procedures involve various energy forms, including radio frequency, laser, or high intensity focused ultrasound, applied through the skin to eliminate fat cells. These technologies vary in the number of treatments required to produce a noticeable effect. Additionally, the high temperatures involved in certain of these procedures may lead to the patient experiencing various degrees of pain. 
We believe that the marketing of these products has extended the sales cycle for CoolSculpting and may continue to have an impact on our sales in the future. 
Due to less stringent regulatory requirements, there are many more aesthetic products and procedures available for use in international markets than are cleared for use in the United States. There are also fewer limitations on the claims our competitors in international markets can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them. As a result, we face more competition in these markets than in the United States. 
We also generally compete against medical technology and aesthetic companies, including those offering products and technologies unrelated to fat reduction, for physician resources and mind share. Some of our competitors have a broad range of product offerings, large direct sales forces, and long-term customer relationships, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. Our potential customers also may need to recoup the cost of expensive products that they have already purchased from our competitors, and thus they may decide to delay or not to purchase our CoolSculpting system. 
We believe that CoolSculpting competes favorably, largely on the basis of the following competitive factors: 

• | CoolSculpting only affects fat cells without endangering any other structures in the skin resulting in more consistent, more predictable and durable outcomes;


• | CoolSculpting is able to achieve measurable results with minimal patient discomfort and high patient satisfaction;

18


• | CoolSculpting does not require a person to administer the procedure after the procedure is started which creates favorable customer practice economics by freeing uptime for the practice to generate additional revenue with new patients or with the patient undergoing CoolSculpting; and


• | Effectiveness of sales and marketing programs and initiatives along with product placement and distribution strategy.

Patents and Proprietary Technology 
To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade-secret laws, as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts. We have implemented a patent strategy designed to protect our technology and facilitate commercialization of our current and future products. As of December 31, 2016, our patent portfolio comprised 146 issued patents and 82 pending patent applications, each of which we either own directly or for which we are the exclusive licensee. Our intellectual property portfolio for our core Cryolipolysis technology was built through the combination of licensing patents from third parties and the issuance of new patents to us as the result of our ongoing development activities. Many of our issued and pending patents were exclusively licensed from MGH and generally relate to our core technology relating to our CoolSculpting system. In general, patents have a term of 20 years from the application filing date or earliest claimed priority date. We expect our issued and exclusively licensed patents to expire in 2023 or later. 
We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how, contractual arrangements, and continuing innovation to protect our intellectual property and maintain our competitive position. We have a policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees, and consultants. We also have a policy that our employees and consultants sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in intellectual property such as patents and copyrights arising from their work for us. It is our policy that all employees sign an agreement not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and upon termination of their employment through the misuse of confidential information, soliciting employees, and soliciting customers. 
ZELTIQ®, CoolSculpting®, Cryolipolysis® and our logo are among our registered trademarks in the United States and in certain foreign countries. 
Seasonal Fluctuations 
Seasonal fluctuations in the number of patients seeking treatment and the availability of our customers are likely to continue to affect our business. Seasonal fluctuations occur in both system revenue and consumable revenue as well as by geographic region. Specifically, our customers often take vacation or are on holiday during the summer months and therefore tend to perform fewer procedures, particularly in certain international countries. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.
Massachusetts General Hospital License Agreement 
In May 2005, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the General Hospital Corporation, which owns and operates the Massachusetts General Hospital, or MGH, which was amended and restated in September 2011. Under this agreement, MGH granted to us an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing license to patent applications related to our controlled cooling platform technology, including the removal of cutaneous, subcutaneous or subdermal fat, treatment or removal of cellulite, and any therapy or procedures to the tissues and structures of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and tumors, lesions and adipose tissue of the skin and of subdermal tissue. As consideration for the license granted to us by MGH, we agreed to pay to MGH (i) an upfront, non-refundable license issue fee of $0.3 million, (ii) a non-refundable minimum annual license maintenance payment of $75,000, $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million upon the first, second, third and each subsequent anniversary of the effective date of the agreement following our first commercial sale, respectively, credited against royalty payments due to MGH on net income and distributor income in the same year, (iii) payments totaling approximately $8.1 million upon the successful achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones, including (a) $1.1 million due upon receipt of FDA clearance to market our CoolSculpting system for the selective reduction of fat, (b) $1 million due upon achieving cumulative net sales of $70 million, and (c) $6 million due upon the earlier to occur of achieving cumulative net sales of $200 million or the completion of a change of control as defined in the agreement, including a qualifying initial public offering and (iv) a 7% royalty on net sales (as defined in the agreement) of CoolSculpting. We have the option to buy down up to 25% of the future royalty payments, and the agreement has a provision that requires an equitable adjustment to a specified royalty rate triggered by certain market conditions. We also agreed to pay to MGH a percentage of sublicense royalties in certain circumstances and to reimburse MGH for all costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of the patent rights under the agreement. 
The agreement will remain in full force and effect for the later of (i) the life of any patents that issue from the underlying patent applications, which are expected to expire in 2023 or (ii) one year after the last commercial sale for which a royalty is due to MGH, unless terminated in accordance with its terms and conditions. MGH may terminate the agreement upon our insolvency, failure to maintain insurance, breach of the agreement, failure to satisfy our development progress obligations, or failure to make required payments. We may terminate the agreement for any reason upon 90 days' advance written notice to MGH. 
19

In September 2015, we entered into a new agreement with MGH to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize certain patents and technology for the treatment of acne and certain related skin conditions. We are obligated to pay a 3% royalty on net sales, as defined in such agreement, of products incorporating such technology.
As of December 31, 2016, we have completed all milestones associated with the license agreement with MGH and have made all required license fee and milestone payments to MGH, described above. We continue to pay the royalty on net sales as required by the agreement and currently have no additional obligations to MGH resulting from any sublicensing agreement.
Government Regulation 
The design, development, manufacture, testing and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA, and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. 
Regulation by the FDA 
In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. The FDA regulates the design, manufacturing, servicing, sale, and distribution of medical devices, including aesthetic devices. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The FDA can also refuse to approve pending applications. 
Each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the United States will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, also called PMA approval. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II, or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device's safety and effectiveness. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and Quality System Regulation, or QSR. Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries, or post-market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, devices of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. 
Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from the FDA. Some Class I devices that have not been so exempted and Class II devices are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA approval or 510(k) de novo clearance prior to commercial marketing. The PMA approval process is more stringent, time-consuming, and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process; however, the 510(k) clearance process has also become increasingly stringent and expensive. 
The CoolSculpting system originally received 510(k) clearance in 2008 as a skin cooling device to minimize pain and thermal injury during laser and dermatological treatments. An additional 510(k) notification was submitted to the FDA in 2008 for the indication of cold-assisted lipolysis and a reduction in the subcutaneous fat layer. That premarket notification was subsequently determined by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent to the predicates identified because the device had a new intended use that alters the therapeutic effect impacting safety and effectiveness; therefore, our device for cold-assisted lipolysis and a reduction in the subcutaneous fat layer was automatically classified as Class III. We petitioned the FDA that this classification should be Class II because it does not support or sustain human life, is not of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, and does not present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. In September 2010, the FDA approved our de novo petition for Class II reclassification and issued a clearance letter for non-invasive fat reduction of the flanks (love handles). Subsequently on May 2, 2012, we received FDA clearance for expansion of the CoolSculpting indication to include the abdomen area. In April 2014, CoolSculpting was cleared by the FDA for treatment of the thigh area, and in January 2015, CoolSculpting was cleared by the FDA for treatment at lower temperatures which enables shorter treatment times. In September 2015, the FDA cleared CoolSculpting for treatment of the submental area under the chin, an area that is consistently ranked as one of the top areas of concern both by consumers and physicians. In March 2016, CoolSculpting was also cleared for the treatment of fat around the bra straps, on the back, and underneath the buttocks or “banana roll.” Most recently, in November 2016, the FDA cleared the CoolSculpting treatment of the upper arm.
20

We are also seeking additional regulatory clearances from the FDA to expand our United States marketed indications for CoolSculpting to areas on the body other than the flanks, abdomen, thighs and the submental area. We have received regulatory approval or are otherwise free to market CoolSculpting in numerous international markets where use of the product is generally not limited to specific treatment areas. 
510(k) clearance. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally marketed in the United States that is not subject to PMA approval, commonly known as the “predicate device.” A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more. 
After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device's safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
Before we can submit a medical device for 510(k) clearance, we may have to perform a series of generally short studies over a period of months, including method comparison, reproducibility, interference and stability studies to ensure that users can use the device successfully. Some of these studies may take place in clinical environments, but are not usually considered clinical trials. For PMA submissions, we would generally be required to conduct a longer clinical trial over a period of years that supports the clinical utility of the device and how the device will be used. 

PMA approval. A PMA application requires the payment of significant user fees to the FDA. PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, pre-clinical, clinical, and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. A PMA application must also include, among other things, a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. 
The FDA has 45 days from its receipt of a PMA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. 
FDA review of an initial PMA application is required by statute to take between six to 10 months, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete. The FDA can delay, limit, or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including: 

• | it is not demonstrated that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe or effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling;


• | the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient; and


• | the manufacturing process, methods, controls, or facilities used for the manufacture, processing, packing, or installation of the device do not meet applicable requirements.


If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA's evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if 
21

compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
Approval by the FDA of new PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. 
Regulation After FDA Clearance or Approval 
Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies, including establishment registration and device listing with the FDA. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which include, among other things, testing, control and documentation requirements. Non-compliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions. We have designed and operate our manufacturing facilities under the FDA's cGMP requirements and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Because we are a manufacturer of medical devices, we must also comply with medical device reporting requirements by reviewing and reporting to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that one of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution. 
Export of Our Products 
Export of products subject to the 510(k) notification requirements, but not yet cleared to market, is permitted with FDA authorization provided certain requirements are met. Unapproved products subject to the PMA approval requirements may be exported if the exporting company and the device meet certain criteria, including, among other things, that the device complies with the laws of the receiving country and the company submits a “Simple Notification” to the FDA when the company begins to export. If the company or device does not comply with such criteria, FDA approval must be obtained for export. To obtain FDA export approval, if required, we must meet certain requirements, including, among other things and with some exceptions, documentation demonstrating that the product is approved for import into the country to which it is to be exported and, in some instances, safety data to demonstrate that export of the device will not be contrary to public health or safety. 
Foreign Government Regulation 
The regulatory review process for medical devices varies from country to country, and many countries also impose product standards, packaging requirements, environmental requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties, and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject a company to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, criminal prosecution, or other consequences. 
Fraud and Abuse Regulations 
We may be subject to numerous federal and state health care anti-fraud laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute and False Claims Act that are intended to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in the health care industry. These laws are broad and subject to evolving interpretations. They prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in industries other than health care, including certain payments for consulting and other personal services, some discounting arrangements, the provision of gifts and business courtesies, the furnishing of free supplies and services, and waivers of payments. In addition, many states have enacted or are considering laws that limit arrangements between medical device manufacturers and physicians and other health care providers and require significant public disclosure concerning permitted arrangements. These laws are vigorously enforced against medical device manufacturers and have resulted in manufacturers paying significant fines and penalties and being subject to stringent corrective action plans and reporting obligations. We must operate our business within the requirements of these laws and, if we were accused of violating them, could be forced to expend significant resources on investigation, remediation, and monetary penalties. Companies targeted in such prosecutions have paid substantial fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, can be 
22

excluded from federal health care programs and become subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, and have often become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. 
Because we have commercial operations overseas, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other countries' anti-corruption/anti-bribery regimes, such as the U.K. Bribery Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws. The FCPA prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations. 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
Our operations are impacted by the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, which, as amended is known as the ACA. Effective January 1, 2013, we began to incur a 2.3% excise tax on sales of medical devices in the United States. Medical device excise tax payments totaled $3.1 million, $2.2 million and $1.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Such excise tax has been temporarily suspended effective January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. 
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and end-of-life handling or disposition of products, and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Although the costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including requirements in the European Union relating to the restriction of use of hazardous substances in products, have not been material, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 686 employees, with 343 employees in sales and marketing, 82 in research and development, including clinical, regulatory and certain quality functions, 166 employees in operations, and 95 employees in general and administrative. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or represented by a labor union. We believe our employee relations are in good standing and we strive to foster a positive work environment.
