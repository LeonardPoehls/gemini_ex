Subsequent Events

Initially, the Company was engaged in the strategic consulting business. However, on January 5, 2010, the Company experienced a change of control, and became engaged in offering automotive extended service warranties.

The Company remained in that automotive extended service warranty business until April 8, 2013, when there was a change of control, and the Company acquired Anatolian Walnut Company ("AWPC"), a Turkish company which owns and operates walnut plantations in Turkey, and was controlled by Ismail Uslu and Mustafa Laz.

The Company continued its ownership of AWPC until June 30, 2017, when Messrs. Uslu and Laz resigned as officers and directors of the Company, appointed Bruno Horn as sole director, and sold all of their common shares and their 20,000 Preferred Shares to Bruno Horn (869,596,180 common shares) and Carla Horn, his wife (96,621,798 common shares), and all 20,000 of their Preferred Shares to Mr. Horn. The 20,000 Preferred Shares were then retired, and there are no Preferred Shares currently issued or outstanding.

Also on June 30, 2017, the Company signed a Reorganization Agreement with SStartrade SA, a Swiss corporation controlled by Mr. Horn, pursuant to which the Company is to acquire 74% of SStartrade SA in exchange for 40,000,000 pre-reverse split common shares of the Company. At the same time, the Company sold AWPC back to Messrs. Uslu and Laz for $1. In connection with the change of control which took place on June 30, 2017, the Company filed an Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, changing its corporate name to SStartrade Tech, Inc., and authorizing a 1-for-10 reverse split of its 995,098,061 currently issued and outstanding common shares. The acquisition of SStartrade SA has not yet been completed.
