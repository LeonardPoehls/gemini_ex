Overview
 
NeuLion, Inc. (“NeuLion,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading provider of enterprise digital video solutions with the mission to deliver and enable the highest quality live and on-demand digital video content experiences anywhere and on any device.  Our flagship solution, the NeuLion Digital Platform, is a proprietary, cloud-based, fully integrated, turnkey solution that enables the delivery and monetization of digital video content.
 
Enterprises throughout the entire digital video ecosystem use our solutions to better grow, engage and monetize their customer bases.  The NeuLion Digital Platform offers content owners and rightsholders a highly configurable and scalable suite of digital technologies, together with services for back-end content preparation, management, secure delivery and monetization, in an end-to-end solution that addresses the complexities associated with successfully streaming and marketing their content.  Our solutions also include our NeuLion consumer electronics (“CE”) technologies, which allow CE manufacturers to provide a secure, high quality video experience with premium screen resolution, up to Ultra HD/4K, across virtually all content formats, for a wide range of connected devices.  Additionally, NeuLion offers a library of high quality video compression-decompression programs, or codecs, that we license under the MainConcept brand.  Our codecs are used by leading technology companies to encode and decode audio and video files.  All three solutions comprise the entire digital video ecosystem.
 
We primarily generate revenue by offering the NeuLion Digital Platform on a subscription license basis.  Our revenue is generated from fees determined by the number of events and linear channels we stream, the number of connected devices we enable, and variable fees determined by the volume of digital video content we deliver and/or the end user revenue generated by our customers.  We also generate revenue from licensing our NeuLion technologies, including our CE software development kit, or SDK, to CE manufacturers and our MainConcept technologies to video solution developers and others.
 
We believe that the proliferation of Internet-connected devices, the increasing amount of digital video content, the growth in video consumption, particularly sports and entertainment content, on mobile and other connected devices and the demand for continually improving and personalizing viewing experiences will be the principal drivers of our growth.  As enterprises continue to struggle with the complexities of managing growing libraries of digital content, creating compelling branded user experiences and delivering those experiences across a wide range of connected devices in high-quality resolutions, our comprehensive suite of products and focus on innovation will allow us to increase revenues from existing customers and expand our customer base in the Americas, Europe and beyond.

On November 30, 2010, we were domesticated under Delaware law, having originally incorporated as Jump TV Inc. on January 14, 2000 under the Canada Business Corporations Act.  In July 2009, we changed our corporate name to NeuLion, Inc.  In January 2015, we consummated the acquisition of DivX, which creates, distributes, and licenses digital video technologies for PCs, smart TVs, and mobile devices.  Its subsidiary, MainConcept, provides codecs and other software products to CE manufacturers, broadcasters, video solution developers and others.  In June 2016, the Company acquired the assets of Saffron Digital.  The Saffron Digital solution, which has been integrated into the NeuLion Digital Platform, helps customers build digital video services for entertainment delivered over-the-top to Internet-connected devices.  These digital video services support advanced implementations of subscription video on demand, electronic sell-through and advertising-supported video.
 
We have traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) since August 9, 2006.
 
Products and Technology
 
The NeuLion Digital Platform, coupled with NeuLion CE and MainConcept technologies, empower the entire video ecosystem.
 
NeuLion Digital Platform
 
NeuLion has developed its own proprietary end-to-end turnkey video distribution platform, called the NeuLion Digital Platform, that provides digital video broadcasting and distribution of live and on-demand sports and entertainment content to any connected device, and also enables the monetization of that content.  A flexible solution that spans the entire digital video workflow and supports the latest technologies, the NeuLion Digital Platform enables global content owners and rightsholders to ingest, encode, manage, deliver, monetize and analyze the performance of their live and on-demand digital video content and delivers the highest quality video, up to Ultra HD/4K, with advanced interactive features.  This product powers the digital experience for leading brands around the world.
 
NeuLion CE Technologies
 
NeuLion CE technologies empower connected devices with premium, up to Ultra HD/4K, screen resolution, secured streaming, playback and certification.  Along with offering a rigorous certification process, NeuLion works throughout the consumer electronics ecosystem to certify CE devices that enable high quality (up to Ultra HD/4K), interoperable video playback.  We license NeuLion CE technologies to some of the biggest names in consumer electronics.
 
MainConcept Technologies
 
Our MainConcept advanced media processing technologies provide video integrators with an extensive library of industry-approved digital video components, from codecs used to implement their own encoding solutions to support for next-generation standards.  These technologies provide advanced video/audio playback solutions that can be integrated into third party software applications, delivering plug-ins for a wide variety of video/audio encoding, decoding and transcoding while providing extensive audiovisual codec and format support for the video industry and third-party integrators.  Our MainConcept technologies are a leading set of video and audio codec solutions.
 
New Development
 
 Next month, at the National Association of Broadcasters show in Las Vegas, Nevada, we will be demonstrating an enhancement to the NeuLion Digital Platform.  NeuLion ACE Analytics offers our customers and prospects the latest advances in data analytics.  NeuLion collects live and on demand “watch data” for the benefit of our OTT and TV Everywhere customers who have licensed the NeuLion Digital Platform.  We have been beta testing NeuLion ACE Analytics with several of our customers.  The new product will offer our customers advanced analytics dashboards that will help target and segment possible new subscriber activations for their services and also pinpoint possible subscriber churn segments.  NeuLion ACE Analytics will be made available to all NeuLion Digital Platform customers.
Customers
 
We have enterprise customers in three broad categories:  content owners and rightsholders; CE manufacturers; and video integrators.  Relationships with our content owner and rightsholder customers, which include entertainment, professional sports (both leagues and teams), college sports (both schools and conferences) and broadcaster/operator customers, generally involve entering into software license, distribution and service agreements to provide end-to-end solutions for the delivery of their content.  We license our NeuLion CE technologies to CE manufacturers to enable their devices to deliver high quality, secure consumer video experiences.  Video integrators, such as enterprise software providers, license our MainConcept technologies to enable their software and hardware solutions with advanced video and audio content processing capabilities.
Customer Dependence
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, no customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, the National Hockey League (“NHL”) and LG Electronics accounted for 12% and 11% of revenue, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, the NHL accounted for 18% of revenue.
 
As at December 31, 2016, Samsung Companies and World Surf League accounted for 15% and 13% of accounts receivable, respectively.  As at December 31, 2015, Samsung Companies and Toshiba Companies accounted for 19% and 14% of accounts receivable, respectively. 
 
In 2016, the NHL transitioned its NHL GameCenter Live digital services to a third party in connection with a media rights transaction.  We continue to provide some digital video and consulting services to the NHL.

Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales team is responsible for acquiring new customers and growing our relationships with existing customers.  Our sales efforts are focused on three main geographic regions:  the Americas; Europe; and Asia.  During 2016, we substantially increased our sales team headcount and expanded our offices globally.  We intend to continue to increase our sales force to allow us to pursue many of the available opportunities for growth within and outside of our existing geographic markets.
 
Our marketing activities are designed to build awareness of our solutions.  Our principal marketing programs include: participation in, and sponsorship of, trade shows and industry events; use of our website to provide information about us and our solutions; integrated digital marketing campaigns, including email, online advertising and webinars; and public relations, analyst relations and social media initiatives.
 
Competition
 
Despite the barriers to entry created by the sizable technology investment required to deliver and monetize live and on-demand interactive content to connected devices, the overall market for digital content publishing and delivery solutions is rapidly evolving and highly competitive.  Our competitors vary for each of our solutions and include companies that build, license and deploy digital video content management services such as MLB Advanced Media and Verizon Digital Media Services, point solution providers such as Brightcove, Kaltura, Ooyala and Adobe, and in-house technology teams.  We also see indirect competition from media technology companies, such as Hulu, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon and sports/entertainment networks, who develop their own technologies internally and then license content rights from content producers for distribution and monetization on their platforms.  Our prospective customers who are content owners and rightsholders may elect to license and deliver their content via these types of third-party platforms.  We also face competition from companies providing products similar to our NeuLion CE and MainConcept technologies, including digital rights management services offered by Microsoft, Verimatrix and Google.
 
We believe the principal factors on which we compete in our market include, and our competitive advantages are, the following:
 
 
· | Reduced enhancement, integration and innovation complexities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Time to market;
--+----------------


· | Ability to drive new revenue opportunities;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Provision of a combination of proprietary technology and operational services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Creation of meaningful experiences that engage, retain and grow viewers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Breadth and depth of product functionality;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Superior customer service;
--+---------------------------


· | Scope of solutions that address the entire media technology ecosystem;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Innovation and responsiveness to new market trends; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | Integration with third-party applications and technologies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------



We believe we compete favorably on the basis of these factors due to our deep experience in the market, and our commitment to and investment in research and development as well as our ability to provide customers of any size with complete, proprietary, integrated turnkey solutions.
 
Our competitors may have access to other advanced technologies and financial resources not available to us, which may enable these competitors to offer products of greater interest to consumers, acquire content rights or provide their solutions at more competitive costs.  If we are not able to compete successfully in attracting new customers or lose existing customers to our competition, our results of operations could be harmed.
 
Seasonality
 
The revenue associated with our sports customers is seasonal because demand for such programming corresponds to the seasons of the sports for which we stream digital video content.  As the majority of our sports contracts contain a variable revenue share or usage component, our revenues are the highest during the first and fourth quarters of the year due to most of our professional sports customers broadcasting the majority of their games during those quarters.  We expect that as we further expand into other streaming areas such as news and entertainment, and into international markets with more sports programming throughout the calendar year, the seasonal nature of our business will decrease.

Intellectual Property
 
Our ability to protect our intellectual property is an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business.  We protect our intellectual property through trade secrets laws, patents, copyrights, trademarks and contracts.  Some of our technology relies upon third-party licensed intellectual property and open source software.
 
Through the DivX transaction, we acquired over 100 U.S. and foreign patents and have many more pending patent applications in the U.S. and abroad.  Through the Saffron Digital transaction, we acquired additional pending and issued patents in the U.S., United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and European Union (“E.U.”) that support technologies relevant to our business.  The DivX and Saffron Digital transactions also added hundreds of U.S. and foreign trademark registrations to our trademark portfolio.
 
We have an active and robust intellectual property protection program.  We are committed to protecting our innovations and brands by filing patent and trademark applications in the United States and any other country that represents an important actual or potential commercial market.
 
In addition to the foregoing, we have established business procedures designed to maintain ownership and confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements and assignment-of-inventions agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business.  We continue to seek new ways to enhance protections over our proprietary information both in the U.S. and abroad.
 
Research and Development
 
Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development, as well as on our ability to continue to innovate and enhance our suite of technologies and solutions.
 
Our research and development costs primarily consist of wages and benefits for research and development department personnel, who are primarily located in China, Russia and the U.S.  Our research and development expenses were $19.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, $24.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 and $8.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014.
 
Employees
 
As of February 27, 2017, we had 657 total employees, 552 of whom were full-time employees.  None of our employees is represented by a union or is party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.  We believe we have good relations with our employees.
