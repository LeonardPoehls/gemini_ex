Item 1. Business
Background
 
The Registrant, DiVall Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnership (the “Partnership”), is a limited partnership organized under the Wisconsin Uniform Limited Partnership Act pursuant to a Certificate of Limited Partnership dated as of November 20, 1987, and governed by a Limited Partnership Agreement, as amended from time to time (collectively, the “Partnership Agreement”). The Partnership is managed by its general partner, The Provo Group, Inc. (“TPG” or the “General Partner”). As of December 31, 2017, the Partnership had 1,296 limited partners owning an aggregate of 46,280.3 Limited Partnership Interests (the “Interests”).
 
The Partnership is engaged in the business of owning and operating its investment portfolio of commercial real estate properties (each a “Property” and collectively, the “Properties”). At December 31, 2017, the Partnership owned 11 Properties, located in a total of four states. 10 of the Properties are leased on a triple net basis primarily to, and operated by, franchisees of national, regional and local fast food, family style, and casual/theme restaurants under long-term leases.
 
At December 31, 2017, eight of the 11 Properties were (and continue to be) leased to three Wendy’s franchisees, with five of the Properties being leased to Wendgusta, LLC (“Wendgusta”), two of the Properties being leased to Wendcharles I, LLC (“Wendcharles I”), and one of the Properties being leased to Wendcharles II, LLC (“Wendcharles II”). An additional Property was leased to Wendgusta until its lease expired on November 6, 2016; this Property is currently vacant. Operating base rents from these eight leases during the year ended December 31, 2017 comprised approximately 77% of the total 2017 operating base rents. During the year ended December 31, 2017, additional percentage rents were also generated from these eight Wendy’s properties and totaled $595,399. Additionally, those eight Properties exceeded 72% of the Partnership’s total Properties, both by historical asset value and number. As a result of the previously reported lease extension notices received by the Partnership in January 2017, all eight of the Properties that are currently leased to Wendy’s franchisees now feature a lease expiration date of November 6, 2026.
 
See Properties under Item 2 below for the table of all Properties and lease expirations and a discussion of Properties with significant developments during the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
During the process of leasing the Properties, the Partnership may experience competition from owners and managers of other properties. As a result, in connection with negotiating tenant leases, along with recognizing market conditions, the General Partner may offer rental concessions, or other inducements, which may have an adverse impact on the results of the Partnership’s operations. The Partnership is also in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for its Properties.
 
The Partnership Agreement specifies that the Partnership is scheduled to be dissolved on November 30, 2020, or earlier upon the prior occurrence of any of the following events: (a) the disposition of all its Properties; (b) the written determination by the General Partner, that the Partnership’s assets may constitute “plan assets” for purposes of ERISA; (c) the agreement of limited partners owning a majority of the outstanding Interests to dissolve the Partnership; or (d) the dissolution, bankruptcy, death, withdrawal, or incapacity of the last remaining General Partner, unless an additional General Partner is elected previously by a majority of the limited partners.
 
On February 15, 2018, the Partnership announced that the General Partner intends to seek affirmative consent from the limited partners to sell the Partnership’s assets, including all the Properties, and liquidate the Partnership. The proposed sale of assets, liquidation and dissolution is expected to be completed by December 31, 2018, and it requires affirmative consents from limited partners owning a majority of the outstanding Interests. Affirmative consents will be sought by a consent solicitation statement that the Partnership expects to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission by April 2018.
 
The Permanent Manager Agreement
 
The Permanent Manager Agreement (“PMA”) was entered into on February 8, 1993, between the Partnership, DiVall 1 (which was dissolved in December 1998), DiVall 3 (which was dissolved in December 2003), the now former general partners, Gary J. DiVall and Paul E. Magnuson, their controlled affiliates, and TPG, naming TPG as the Permanent Manager. The PMA contains provisions allowing TPG to submit to the PMA, election of TPG as General Partner, and the issue of acceptance of the resignations of the former general partners to a vote of the limited partners through a solicitation of written consents.

TPG, as the General Partner, has been operating and managing the affairs of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of the PMA and the Partnership Agreement since February 8, 1993.
 
Effective January 1, 2017, the PMA was renewed by the General Partner for a two-year period ending December 31, 2018. The PMA can be terminated earlier (a) by a vote at any time by a majority interest of the limited partners, (b) upon the dissolution and winding up of the Partnership, (c) upon the entry of an order of a court finding that TPG has engaged in fraud or other like misconduct or has shown itself to be incompetent in carrying out its duties under the Partnership Agreement, or (d) upon 60 days’ written notice from TPG to the limited partners of the Partnership.
 
Advisory Board
 
The concept of the Advisory Board was first introduced by TPG during the solicitation of written consents seeking to elect TPG as the General Partner. The first Advisory Board was established in October 1993. Among other functions, the three-person Advisory Board has the following rights and duties: to review operational policies and practices; to review extraordinary transactions; to review internal financial controls and practices; and to review the performance of the independent auditors of the Partnership. The Advisory Board’s powers are advisory only and the Advisory Board does not have the authority to direct management decisions or policies of the Partnership or remove the General Partner. The Advisory Board has full and free access to the Partnership’s books and records, and individual Advisory Board members have the right to communicate directly with the limited partners concerning Partnership business. Members of the Advisory Board are compensated $1,500 annually and $500 for each quarterly meeting attended.
 
The Advisory Board currently consists of a broker dealer representative, William Arnold; and limited partners of the Partnership: Jesse Small and Albert Kramer. For a brief description of each Advisory Board member, refer to Item 10, Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant.
