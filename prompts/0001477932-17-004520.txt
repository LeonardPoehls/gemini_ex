Item 1. Business
Background
 
Business Overview
 
We were incorporated on December 18, 2007, in the State of Nevada. We are a smaller reporting biomedical company and through our wholly owned subsidiary, Cerebain Operating, Inc. (“Cerebain”), our business involves the discovery of products for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease utilizing Omentum. Under our current plan, our products will include both a medical device solution as well as a synthetic drug solution. 
 
Our only operations are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cerebain Operating, Inc. The term “we” as used throughout this document refers to Cerebain Biotech Corp. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cerebain Operating, Inc.
 
In accordance with our current business plan, the testing, research and development of both a medical device solution as well as a synthetic drug solution are underway, and we have contracted with certain third party companies to research, develop, and test certain products that could be used to treat dementia utilizing Omentum. We have also contracted with various individuals to facilitate the introduction of the Company to medical device testing organizations in overseas locations including Poland, China and Uzbekistan for the purpose of testing our medicinal treatments utilizing Omentum. Our management anticipates that we may form subsidiaries and joint ventures to develop different drugs based on the intellectual property. Although we have contracted with a firm to research, develop and test products that could be used to treat dementia utilizing Omentum, in order to fully execute on that agreement, as well as hire one or more firms to research, develop and test medicinal treatments utilizing Omentum, we will need to raise additional funds. There can be no assurance we will be successful in raising the necessary funds. There can also be no assurance that further research and development will validate and support the results of our preliminary research and studies, or that the necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained or that we will be able to develop commercially viable products on the basis of our technologies.
 
General
 
Description of Patent License Agreement
 
On June 10, 2010, our subsidiary, Cerebain Operating, Inc., entered into a Patent License Agreement under which it acquired the exclusive rights to certain intellectual property related to using Omentum for treating dementia conditions. Under the agreement, we paid rights fees of $50,000 to Dr. Saini, and issued Dr. Saini 825,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $6,600 (based on the fair market value on the date of grant) restricted in accordance with Rule 144. In addition, Dr. Saini has the option to participate in the sale of equity by us in the future, up to ten percent (10%) of the money raised, in exchange for the applicable number of his shares. 
 
The Patent License agreement provides for a royalty payment of six (6) percent of the value of the net sales, as defined, generated from the sale of licensed products. The agreement also provides for yearly minimum royalty payments of $50,000 for the fourth (June 2014), fifth (June 2015), and sixth (June 2016) anniversary of the date of the agreement, and a yearly minimum royalty payment of $100,000 for each year thereafter during the term of the agreement. We have recognized costs associated with the patent rights for $250,000 in accounts payable at June 30, 2017 for the patent rights and are currently in arrears and in discussions to renegotiate the terms of the agreement. The term of the agreement shall continue until the patent in the intellectual property expires, unless terminated sooner under the provisions of the agreement, as defined.

Legal fees, pertaining to the patent, are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred. Legal fees charged to operations were approximately $7,500 and $2,500 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
We recognized a patent royalty expense of approximately $100,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to $150,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The accrued payable of $250,000 pertaining to the patent royalty expense at June 30, 2017 is included in related party payables.
 
Overview of Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease
 
Dementia (taken from Latin, originally meaning "madness") is generally referred to as a serious loss and/or decline of human brain function. The areas of brain function affected by dementia include memory, attention, language, problem solving and emotion. Dementia is generally considered as a progressive and non-reversible condition. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia. Alzheimer’s disease is an age-related, non-reversible brain disorder that develops over a period of years. Initially, people experience memory loss and confusion, which may be mistaken for the kinds of memory changes that are sometimes associated with normal aging. However, the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease gradually lead to behavior and personality changes, a decline in cognitive abilities such as decision making and language skills, and problems recognizing family and friends. Alzheimer’s disease ultimately leads to a severe loss of mental functions. These losses are related to the worsening breakdown of the connections between certain neurons in the brain responsible for memory and learning. Neurons can’t survive when they lose their connections to other neurons. As neurons die throughout the brain, the affected regions begin to atrophy, or shrink. By the final stage of Alzheimer’s disease, damage is widespread and brain tissue has shrunk significantly.
Causes
 
Many scientists generally accept that one or more of the following mechanisms are responsible for dementia:
 
1) accumulation of toxic materials in brain cells, which leads to death of the cells;
 2) reduction of certain biological factors (e.g. Acetylcholine or ACh) in a brain; and
 3) loss or reduction of blood flow in the brain.
 
Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are the most common causes of dementia. Dementia can also be due to a stroke. In most circumstances, the changes in the brain that are causing dementia cannot be controlled or reversed. 
Statistics
 


· | Affected population worldwide
--+------------------------------

 
According to the Alzheimer’s Association 2017 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures, an estimated 5.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, including approximately 200,000 individuals younger than age 65 who have younger-onset Alzheimer's. By 2050, it is estimated that up to 16 million Americans will have the disease. Almost two-thirds, 3.3 million, of American seniors living with Alzheimer's are women. By 2025, it is estimated that 20 states will see a 35 percent or greater growth in the number of people with Alzheimer’s. Someone in the United States develops Alzheimer’s every 66 seconds. In 2050, it is predicted that someone in the United States will develop the disease every 33 seconds.

In addition, the Alzheimer’s Association stated Alzheimer’s disease is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States and the 5th leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older. In 2013, over 84,000 Americans officially died from Alzheimer’s; in 2016, an estimated 700,000 people will die with Alzheimer’s, meaning they will die after having developed the disease. Deaths from Alzheimer increased 71 percent from 2000 to 2013, while deaths from other major diseases (including heart disease, stroke, breast and prostate cancer, and HIVAIDS) decreased. Alzheimer’s is the only cause of death among the top 10 in America that cannot be prevented, cured, or even slowed.
 

According to the 2015 World Alzheimer Report, in 2015 about 46.8 million people had dementia worldwide. The report stated that this figure is likely to nearly double every 20 years, to nearly 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050. For 2015, they estimate over 9.9 million new cases of dementia each year worldwide, implying one new case every 3.2 seconds. The regional distribution of new dementia cases is 4.9 million (49% of the total) in Asia, 2.5 million (25%) in Europe, 1.7 million (18%) in the Americas, and 0.8 million (8%) in Africa.
 


· | Cost
--+-----

 
According to the Alzheimer’s Association 2017 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures, unpaid caregivers are primarily immediate family members, but they may be other relatives and friends. In 2015, 15.9 million family and friends provided an estimated 18.1 billion hours of unpaid care, a contribution to the nation valued at over $221.3 billion. Nearly half of care contributors cut back on their own expenses (including food, transportation and medical care) to pay for dementia-related care of a family member or friend. Care contributors are 28 percent more likely than other adults to eat less or go hungry because they cannot afford to pay for food. One in five care contributors cut back on their own doctor visits because of their care responsibilities. And, among caregivers, 74 percent report they are “somewhat” to “very” concerned about maintaining their own health since becoming a caregiver. On average care contributors lose over $15,000 in annual income as a result of reducing or quitting work to meet the demand of caregiving.
 
According to the 2015 World Alzheimer Report, the global cost of care for dementia will likely exceed $818 billion in 2015, or 1.09 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP). These costs include those attributed to informal care from family member or others, direct social care from professional care givers, and direct medical bills. About 70% of these costs occur in Western Europe and North America. Such costs will continue to increase dramatically as the affected population of dementia increases.
 


· | Cost to Nation
--+---------------

 
According to the Alzheimer’s Association 2017 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures, Alzheimer’s disease is the most expensive condition in the nation. In 2017, the direct costs to American society of caring for those with Alzheimer's will total an estimated $236 billion, with just under half of the costs borne by Medicare. Nearly one in every five Medicare dollars is spent on people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias. In 2050, it is estimated it will be one in every three dollars. The average per-person Medicare spending for those with Alzheimer's and other dementias is three times higher than for those without these conditions. The average per-person Medicaid spending for seniors with Alzheimer's and other dementias is 19 times higher than average per-person Medicaid spending for all other seniors. Unless something is done, in 2050, Alzheimer’s will cost over $1.1 trillion (in 2016 dollars). Costs to Medicare will increase over 365 percent to $589 billion.

Current Approaches to Treating Dementia
 
Currently, there is no cure for dementia. There are a number of prescription drugs that target those with Alzheimer’s and dementia, however those drugs primarily relieve some of the disease mechanisms and are often used early in the course of the disease; however, their effects in long-term progression of the disease condition are still unclear. A majority of management of dementia generally focuses on providing emotional and physical support to a patient during the progression of the disease from caregivers or in facilities. While such support is important and necessary to a patient, it is irrelevant to treatment of the disease. Accordingly, an effective method of treatment which may be able to delay the progression of the disease and/or recover damaged brain cells does not presently exist and remains a great need. 
 
Omentum and its Use in Treating Dementia
 
Omentum Overview
 
The Omentum is a layer of tissue lying over internal organs (e.g. the intestines) like a blanket. Omentum has the ability to generate biological agents that nourish nerves and help them grow. When such agents identified from the Omentum were tested, they were shown to provoke the growth of new brain cells in areas of the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease. The Omentum tissue can also increase the level of Acetylcholine (ACh) whose reduction is considered as a main cause of brain cell death. Some scientists believe that the ability of the Omentum to provide this important factor (ACh) may be a key to successfully treating dementia. Additionally, the Omentum has been shown to be angiogenic (i.e. to promote new blood vessel growth) in areas of the body lacking blood flow. 
Use of Omentum in Treating Dementia
 
Historically, doctors have utilized Omentum to treat dementia using a procedure called omental transposition. This approach involves a surgical procedure in which the Omentum is surgically lengthened into the brain through the chest, neck and behind the ear. The Omentum is then laid directly on the underlying brain. According to studies conducted by a team in the University of Nevada, School of Medicine, omental transposition not only arrested Alzheimer's disease, but also reversed it, resulting in the patient’s neurologic function being improved. Despite the promising results, this surgical procedure has not been popular because it is very invasive and therefore often causes unwanted complications to a patient, especially in the elderly. Accordingly, a less invasive procedure or a pharmaceutical approach in treatment of dementia remains a significant need.
Principal Products and Services
 
Our Products
 
Dr. Saini is the inventor of U.S. Patent Application No. 15/493,535, derived from Patent Applications No. 15/260,699, No. 15/006,939, No. 13/849,014, No. 13/309,468 and No. 12/361,808, and its foreign counterparts in Europe and Japan. He is one of our founders and a medical advisor to the Company. As a practicing physician, he is a gastrointestinal specialist, and often needs to apply a gastrostomy tube to an abdominal area of a patient for surgical procedures. In some cases, when a patient having dementia underwent such surgery, Dr. Saini observed that some of symptoms of dementia became noticeably improved for at least 24 hours or longer after the surgery. These observations led Dr. Saini to a hypothesis that stimulation of Omentum can improve conditions related to dementia and such improvement may occur because the stimulation of Omentum induces production and/or secretion of some biological agent(s) that can improve such conditions.

7

 
Based on these observations, Dr. Saini conducted intensive studies that led to the discovery of a potential breakthrough in the treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease. These breakthroughs are described in Dr. Saini’s pending patent applications, which we have licensed from Dr. Saini under the patent license agreement. More particularly, the pending patent applications describe in detail a variety of methods of isolating several biological agents from the Omentum and testing the agents for their activity in treating dementia conditions. The isolation and identification of active biological agents can be done with the Omentum tissue obtained from a patient or grown in a petri-dish. Accordingly, methods of producing the Omentum tissue, possibly on a large scale, are included in the applications.
 
Once the active biological agent(s) are identified, a composition (e.g. various forms of medicaments) having such agents can be produced for treatment of a patient. Alternatively, the Omentum tissue/extract containing the active agents can be used to produce the composition. 
 
With respect to treatment methods, there is a method of administering the composition having the isolated active biological agents to a patient. The composition can be manufactured in different forms (e.g. oral medication or injection) and can be administered to a patient accordingly. The ability to treat dementia using Omentum through oral medication or injection would provide a breakthrough in the treatment of dementia using Omentum, which has historically been applied only through a surgical procedure. In addition, methods of monitoring improvement of the disease conditions after the treatment are provided in the applications.
 
Dr. Saini’s patent application also discloses a method for producing the Omentum tissue in a petri-dish. The growth of such material outside of the human body will permit the large-scale production of material that can be used as raw materials for treatment and/or further research.
 
Currently, Dr. Saini has been conducting a series of scientific experiments with other experts in the research area to prove the efficacy and applicability of the above-listed treatment methods. 
 
Up until now, it has been notoriously difficult to identify effective treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. All of the efforts heretofore, have been directed to palliative treatments or addressing the three mechanisms of action discussed above. Many once-promising therapies have been shown to address one or more of the underlying mechanisms of action; however, many such therapies fail in clinical trials because no clear improvement in mental function can be shown. In contrast, Dr. Saini’s invention was developed based on the observation that a clear improvement in mental function was observed in patients whose Omentum had been stimulated. Thus, Dr. Saini’s invention was based on the premise that clinical improvement could be obtained rather than on a hope that affecting one of the underlying mechanisms of action would also affect mental functioning.
 
Another advantage of Dr. Saini’s technology is that patents were written in a manner that permitted all stages of the development of the technology to be covered. Thus, the technology includes the direct stimulation of Omentum tissue, which leads to release of the factors that can promote mental functioning. Once it can be proven that such factors exist and are effective, the technology also provides methods for identifying what such relevant factors are and then isolating or producing such factors. To the extent that the Omentum itself is necessary to produce such factors, the invention provides that the Omentum can be grown in tissue culture, and used directly or factors isolated from it. The ability to grow the tissue in culture obviates the need to obtain Omentum tissue directly from patients or animals.

Industry Overview
 
As noted above, according to the Alzheimer’s Association 2017 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures, an estimated 5.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, including approximately 200,000 individuals younger than age 65 who have younger-onset Alzheimer's. By 2050, it is estimated up to 16 million will have the disease. Almost two-thirds, 3.3 million, of American seniors living with Alzheimer's are women. By 2025, it is estimated 20 states will see a 35 percent or greater growth in the number of people with Alzheimer’s. Someone in the United States develops Alzheimer’s every 66 seconds. In 2050, it is estimated someone in the United States will develop the disease every 33 seconds. The global cost of care for dementia exceeded $818 billion in 2015, or 1.09 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP) according to the 2015 World Alzheimer Report. These costs include those attributed to informal care from family member or others, direct social care from professional care givers, and direct medical bills. About 70% of these costs occur in Western Europe and North America. Such costs will continue to increase drastically as the affected population of dementia increases.
Marketing 
 
We plan to launch a marketing campaign using a number of different channels. We plan to work with already established affiliates and partnerships to promote our products to healthcare providers and Alzheimer patients. We also plan to market directly to consumers through direct-to-consumer advertising that communicates the uses, benefits and risks of our products. In addition, we plan to sponsor general advertising to educate the public on Alzheimer’s disease awareness, prevention and wellness, and public health issues. However, we will need to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering, which we currently have no commitments for.
Customers
 
If we are successful in bringing a product to market, our customers will be consumers suffering through the various stages of Alzheimer’s disease.
 
Distribution
 
If we are successful in bringing a product to market we plan to distribute our products principally through wholesalers, but we will also try to sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies.
Competition
 
Due to the number of people suffering from dementia, and the projected future numbers, there are several players in the dementia medication market. Four of the five Alzheimer’s disease-inhibiting drugs approved to treat Alzheimer’s in the United States – donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Razadyne), rivastigmine (Exelon), and tacrine (Cognex) – belong to the same class and essentially work the same way. They reduce the breakdown in the brain of a chemical called acetylcholine, which is a chemical messenger that transmits information from nerve cell to nerve cell. This effectively increases levels of acetylcholine in the brain, and may preserve brain function. These drugs are generally capable, at best, of boosting memory for up to 18 months. After that, patients continue to decline as the disease progresses.
 
The fifth and most recently approved drug, memantine (Namenda), works differently. It blocks the actions of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Glutamate is needed for memory but too much of it is toxic to nerve cells and it appears that in people with Alzheimer’s, there is too much of it (for unknown reasons). 
 
Of these five drugs currently approved to treat Alzheimer’s in the United States, none of them “cure" Alzheimer’s disease. They are all disease-inhibiting drugs. Studies have found these drugs only treat symptoms of the disease and can slow a person’s mental decline and ease symptoms (especially forgetfulness and confusion), but they do not stop the disease.
 
All the studies indicate that when people taking any of the Alzheimer’s medicines are compared to those taking a placebo, only 10% to 20% more people taking the drug get a significant, noticeable or sustained response. And it is the rare person who has a strong response, with marked improvement or a significant delay in the worsening of symptoms. By another measure, one team of researchers calculated that for every three to seven people taking an Alzheimer’s drug, only one benefits at all. Unfortunately, there is no way as yet to predict who will respond and who will have little or no benefit.

Disease-arresting drugs, however, would be a game changer. These drugs would target what researchers believe is the root cause of Alzheimer’s: a buildup of protein called beta-amyloid or a-beta (often referred to as plaque) that is poisonous to brain cells. If they work, doctors could administer the drugs during the earlier stages of the disease, when brain damage caused by disease is still manageable. The drugs could then be used to keep the disease in check, giving patients the prospect of going on to live relatively normal lives.
 
Research and Development
 
In an effort to develop a less invasive procedure in the treatment of dementia, on May 16, 2012, we signed an agreement with medical device product development company Sonos Models, Inc. (“Sonos”) to assess our options for a medical device solution (“Initial Feasibility Study”).
 
We completed the Initial Feasibility Study and, as a result of the findings, entered into an agreement with Sonos in September 2012 to build up to three medical device prototypes to be used for testing. In April 2014, we entered into an addendum to the agreement with Sonos, which included a commitment by us to pay Sonos up to One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) cash, excluding stock based compensation, for research and development costs. These costs will be recognized in research and development expense as costs are incurred. To date, Sonos has been issued 325,000 restricted shares of our stock and paid approximately $220,000, of which $65,000 has been incurred towards our monetary commitment.
 
To date, the results of the research suggest we have three options for implantable devices with a bias towards having them as non-invasive as possible. The options are comprised of two electro-stim types that have a multitude of variable test parameters that can be changed and modified externally as the testing facility conducts clinical trials on each patient. It is theorized that if a patient’s response to the Omentum stimulation is successful, the clinical facility should be able to perform various tests for the purpose of setting “markers” for the patient and then perform the standardized cognitive testing for Alzheimer’s patient with the intent of developing a testing matrix. It is our objective to test various methods and modalities with the aim of developing an enormous matrix of input to direct us to the best solution. Our goal is to be less invasive, as small as possible and as simple as possible to reach the broadest patient base. We intend to “Shape and Innovate History” as we visualize and create a solution for this debilitating disease.
 
Liability and Insurance
 
We currently do not maintain a general liability insurance policy. However, we plan to obtain general liability insurance policy in advance of releasing products. We believe that our anticipated insurance coverage will be adequate for the types of products and services that may be marketed in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that such insurance will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present level of coverage, or increased coverage, will be available in the future at a reasonable cost. 
Government Regulation
 
Our research, development and testing of potential products, including clinical trials, will be subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States, both federal and state. The sanctions for failure to comply with such laws, regulations, or rules could include denial of the right to conduct business, significant fines, and criminal and civil penalties. An increase in the complexity or substantive requirements of such laws, regulations, or rules could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any change in the current regulatory requirements or related interpretations of regulatory requirement could adversely affect our operations. Moreover, as noted above, we intend to commence clinical trials in Poland and other foreign countries. We will be subject to regulations by each respective country’s governmental authority.

Intellectual Property
 
Currently, our only intellectual property is the patent we are licensing from Dr. Saini. Other than that, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, we do not have any other intellectual property. As noted above, we entered into a Patent License Agreement under which the Company acquired the exclusive rights to certain intellectual property related to using Omentum for treating dementia conditions. Under the agreement we have paid rights fees of $50,000 to Dr. Saini, and the Company issued Dr. Saini 825,000 shares of our common stock. We have recognized costs associated with the patent rights for $250,000 in accounts payable at June 30, 2017 for the patent rights and are currently in arrears and in discussions to renegotiate the terms of the agreement.
Employees and Contractors
 
As of the date of this filing, we have 2 employees and 18 independent contractors.
 
Facilities
 
Our principal executive and administrative offices, and those of Cerebain, are currently located at 600 Anton Blvd., Suite 1100, Costa Mesa, CA 92626. Our office space is located at an executive suites location and is leased on a month to month basis. Our monthly lease payment is $349 per month. Due to the nature of our business, the majority of our operations and research & development are outsourced, thereby reducing the need for a sizeable facility.
