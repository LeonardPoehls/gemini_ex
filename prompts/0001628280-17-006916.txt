ITEM 1    BUSINESS
Organizational History
MoneyOnMobile, Inc., a Texas corporation headquartered in Dallas, Texas, was incorporated on May 30, 2006, as Toyzap.com, Inc., and became a public company on May 7, 2008, through a self-underwritten registered public offering of 4,000,000 shares of $.001 par value common stock.  The offering raised $150,000 that was used to pursue a business strategy that never commenced operations.  The “shell company”, Toyzap.com, Inc., was acquired by members of the Company’s current management team, affiliates thereof, and certain other purchasers, on April 23, 2010, pursuant to purchase agreements whereby approximately 99% of the Company’s then issued and outstanding common stock was acquired.  At such time, the former management and Board of Directors resigned and a new management team and Board of Directors were appointed, who then redirected the business focus of the Company to the business plan described below.  On September 3, 2010, the Company changed its name to “Calpian, Inc.” pursuant to approval obtained at a meeting of our shareholders.  On August 9, 2016, the Company changed its name to "MoneyOnMobile, Inc." pursuant to approval obtained at a meeting of our shareholders. The Company’s common stock began trading in the over the counter (“OTC”) market on March 4, 2009. 
In March 2013, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Calpian Commerce, Inc. (“Calpian Commerce”), to own and operate certain assets and liabilities of Pipeline Data, Inc. and its subsidiaries acquired in exchange for a cash payment of $9.75 million.  The acquisition was financed by expanding the Company's senior credit facility from $5 million to $14.5 million. Effective November 30, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with eVance Processing Inc. ("eVance") to divest its Calpian Commerce business segment and certain other U.S. residual portfolio assets of the Company including its partially-owned joint venture Calpian Residual Acquisition, LLC, and its equity investment in Calpian Granite Hill, L.P. This action was undertaken to allow the Company to focus entirely on executing its growth strategy in India. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations. 
In March 2012, the Company began to invest in a Mumbai, India-based mobile money system catering to India's vast unbanked and under-banked populations. It allows consumers to deposit cash with one of our retail agents. The Company's investment was achieved by acquiring equity interests in Digital Payments Processing Limited (“DPPL”), a newly-organized company.  DPPL maintains an exclusive services agreement with My Mobile Payments Limited (“MMPL”).  Additionally, Payblox Technologies (India) Private Limited (“Payblox”), a wholly owned subsidiary of MMPL, organized in October 2010 under the laws of India and headquartered in Mumbai, India, provides certain back office and support services on behalf of MMPL to its customer base. These companies are all organized under the laws of India and headquartered in Mumbai, India.  MoneyOnMobile, Inc. is the primary beneficiary of MMPL. 
On March 31, 2015, My Mobile Payments Limited executed a business transfer agreement to sell its business to DPPL. As of March 31, 2017, the Company has acquired 75.1% and 13.7% of the outstanding common stock of DPPL and MMPL, respectively.  The Company and MMPL have entered into an agreement by which the Company intends to acquire additional shares of common stock of MMPL to increase its equity percentage to 74% for an additional investment amount to be negotiated as future investments are made.  The acquisition of additional shares is subject to approval by the Indian government and regulations for foreign investment. 
Business Overview 
The Company operates one business segment: MoneyOnMobile, an India based mobile electronic wallet service used to pay for goods and services from a mobile phone and to make other financial transactions.
MoneyOnMobile, Inc. is one of India’s largest mobile payments technology and processing company offering digital payment services. MoneyOnMobile services enable Indian businesses and consumers to use their mobile phones to pay for goods and services or transfer funds from one mobile phone to another using simple SMS text functionality instead of cash.
Our technology also allows consumers to deposit funds into a mobile wallet or to perform a financial transaction through its robust agent network which includes over 330,000 retail locations as of March 31, 2017. Consumers use their mobile phones to make certain routine payments for utilities or to transfer currency to other consumers using text-messaging and mobile application technology. The license to operate has been issued by the Reserve Bank of India and is the property of My Mobile Payments Limited (‘‘MMPL’’), which maintains custody of customers’ funds in accordance with India’s regulations. An affiliate of MoneyOnMobile, Digital Payments Processing Limited (‘‘DPPL’’), owns and operates the retail agent network, the customer support call center, the sales support functions, and the intellectual property necessary to process transactions. MoneyOnMobile representatives Messrs. Montgomery and Arey are two of the four members of DPPL’s board of directors. Mr. Montgomery is Chairman of the DPPL board with a tie-breaking vote. Mr. Montgomery also is one of 5 members of MMPL’s board.
Indian Payment Processing Market
In India, the majority of consumer payments are made in person with cash, and most routine services are paid in advance. Effecting the simplest transactions (e.g., buying cell-phone minutes, paying for cable or satellite television time, and paying electric or water bills) can be both time consuming and inconvenient. Typically each service has its own payment location, meaning travel can be significant and waiting lines can be long. In addition, workers moving from the country to the city find the process of sending money home in cash or by courier can be risky, unreliable, and expensive. It is difficult to confirm receipt of the funds transfer, and the recipient may experience significant delays in receiving the money.
In India, consumers are often required to prepay for certain utilities, such as mobile phone services or their electricity, and because bank accounts and credit cards are only used by a small portion of the Indian population. Currently, there are approximately 29 million credit cards in use for a population of approximately 1.3 billion people. Consumers typically prepay for their utilities with cash, either directly to utility providers or through distributors.
MoneyOnMobile Business Model
We offer electronic wallet services (‘‘MOM wallet’’), similar to carrying a prepaid debit card, using the consumer’s mobile phone. MoneyOnMobile is the first provider in India to have a multi-lingual app for a service in this category. By using this application, customers, through our robust agent network, can pay for goods and services and send money anytime and anywhere. MoneyOnMobile service uses mobile phone numbers to identify the consumer.
The MoneyOnMobile service launched in April 2011 and as of April 30, 2017 has provided service to more than 199 million unique mobile phone users. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, processing volume was approximately $227 million in transaction volume. MobileOnMoney is ranked as one of the top mobile money providers globally based on the number of unregistered users who used the mobile money service as compiled by GSMA’s 2015 Global Adoption Survey. MMPL currently has a license to operate a payments system received from the Reserve Bank of India. Renewal is required in October 2018, which we expect to receive.
MoneyOnMobile acts as an intermediary between:

• | Utility providers;

MoneyOnMobile purchases utility units, such as mobile phone minutes, at wholesale rates and resells these units to distributors. MoneyOnMobile maintains a balance of these units held for resale. Additionally, we process utility bill payments made by consumers.

• | Retailers/mobile money agents;

For businesses, MoneyOnMobile acts as an intermediary, a single vendor providing mobile payment solutions to most cellular and DTH providers, allowing a small retailer to sell minutes from any provider. Individual retailers are able to execute ‘‘retailer assisted transactions’’ with consumers to provide all available services.

• | Consumers;

The consumer is able to digitize their cash into the MoneyOnMobile system leveraging our agent network. This occurs when the consumer pays cash at any of our independent retailer stores, which is then credited to the consumer’s MOM 
wallet. To move funds from the user’s account to another individual’s account, a text message to the MoneyOnMobile network tells who and what amount to pay. The amount is instantly deducted from the sender’s account and credited to the recipient’s bank account. Both parties receive a confirmation within seconds of the money transfer. Once a consumer has established a MOM wallet account, they can use MoneyOnMobile’s technology to facilitate peer-to-peer or non-distributor-related transactions with other parties that have MoneyOnMobile accounts, including other retailers, utilities and other MoneyOnMobile consumers. MoneyOnMobile earns a transaction fee for these services.
Business Developments
MoneyOnMobile signed an agreement with Enfold, a third party vender, and MicroSoft to provide digital lockers for MoneyOnMobile’s customers. As part of the company’s philosophy of doing well by doing good, we recently launched accident insurance and digital gift cards, which allows consumers to make purchases online at several e-Commerce vendors, including Amazon.in and Flipkart.
MoneyOnMobile recently launched the MOM ATM in selected retail outlets across India to meet the growing demand for digitizing currency and executing cash-out transactions. The MOM ATM allows retail merchants to serve as ATMs. Any banked customer can withdraw cash from their bank account and any consumer with a prepaid payroll card can withdraw cash at any of our participating retailers. Our solutions make storing money in bank accounts more attractive to people across India because they will be able to access their funds at a time and place that is convenient to them. Currently, there are just over 200,000 ATMs in India, whose population could support a substantially higher number when compared to other countries ATM penetration rates. MOM ATMs are helping to address this need in the India market.
