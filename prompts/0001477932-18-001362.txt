Item 1. Description of Business
Introduction
 
Our Company is a provider of health and nutritional supplements and personal care products. Currently, we mainly sell our products over the Internet directly to end-user customers through our websites, www.dailynu.com and www.merionus.com, and to wholesale distributors through phone and electronic communication. Our major customers are located in the Asian market, predominantly in the People’s Republic of China.
Company History
 
Merion, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was formed on February 4, 2011. Its predecessor, E-World USA Holding, Inc., was a California company incorporated in 2007 (“E-World CA”). In April 2011, E-World CA entered into a merger agreement with its wholly-owned subsidiary with the same name, E-World USA Holding, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“E-World NV”), that was the survivor of the merger and became the Company. Under the Merger Agreement, the Company issued 90,000,000 shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis for each share of E-World CA’s common stock issued and outstanding at the date of the merger. In addition, the Company issued its Type A Warrants and Type B Warrants in exchange for comparable warrants issued and outstanding of E-World CA at the date of the merger. On June 27, 2017, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada to change its name effective immediately, from E-World NV, to Merion, Inc. 
Products
 
In June 2014, we suspended our personal network marketing model in China in response to the legal action taken by the Chinese authorities. Since June 2014, we have sold our products primarily over the Internet directly to end-user customers and by phone/email orders directly to our wholesale distributors. Certain miscellaneous sales are made directly to customers who walk into the Company offices and customers who call the Company directly for products. We are now focusing on selling health and nutritional supplements and personal care products directly on the Internet through our websites, www.dailynu.com and www.merionus.com. As of the date of filing of this Report, we continue to market our six individual nutritional supplement products and seven skin-care and beauty products on these websites. In addition, we currently have six new individual nutritional supplement products that we only sell to wholesale distributors and one new skin-care and beauty products that we sell through our websites. We also sell similar products of third parties on our websites. 
Company Products
 
Our nutritional supplement products are made according to a micro molecular nutrition formula. To achieve the maximum effect of products, micro molecular health foods were designed to be absorbed by cells directly with minimum chemical conversion which we believe promotes faster absorption. We believe our company is one of only a few companies in the market which are using a micro molecular nutrition formula.
 
In November and December 2016, our Dibeier Granules & Oral products successfully passed inspection by the Shenzhen Academy of Metrology & Quality Inspection and the Guangdong Quality Supervision and Inspection Institution for Food (Shenzhen). A copy of these two inspection reports is filed as exhibits to the Company’s Form 10-K for 2015 filed on February 7, 2017. As a result, we believe that our Dibeier Granules & Oral products (“Dibeier Products”) will be able to be directly exported to the China market and sold at nutritional supplement stores in China as food, rather than only through our website. However, no assurance can be given that such exports will eventually occur. We are currently in the process of negotiating with two companies in China to import our Dibeier Products to be sold over-the-counter in retail locations such as nutritional product stores. No assurances can be given that such sales contracts can be secured that would allow us to start exporting our Dibeier Products to Chinese customers. 
 
In June and July 2017, we introduced three new nutritional supplement products: Hepaticia, Auxia, and Capsule of Beauty. In October 2017, we introduced two nutritional supplement products: AntiGrey and Cell Vitality. Hepacticia is a nutritional supplement product that may support liver health. Auxia is a nutritional supplement that may support kidney health. Capsule of Beauty is a nutritional supplement that may prevent wrinkles and support nail health. AntiGrey is a nutritional supplement that may prevent grey hair. Cell Vitality is a nutritional supplement that may support eye health.

In January 2018, we introduced a new skin-care and beauty product, Noir Naturel, a gentle formula for grey coverage from the first application into hair. 
 
The nutritional supplements do not have patent protection for the formulas. Nutritional products constituted 100% and 96% of total sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Our skin-care products were developed, and formulas are owned, by another company from which we purchased the rebranding right. These products focus on restoring epidermal calcium. The products are intended to provide a positive epidermal environment for the homeostasis and regeneration of a person’s own skin barrier. The products were first introduced in 2010 and constituted 0% and 4% of the 2017 and 2016 annual sales, respectively.
 
Other Products
 
We sell other health and nutrition products manufactured by third parties that are already being sold by third-party vendors. Merion has obtained permission from the third-party vendors to resell the products on our www.dailynu.com website on a purchase order basis. 
 
Sales breakdown
 

 | 2017 | | | 2016
------------------------------+------+-----+---+-----
Nutritional products | | 100 | % | | 96 | %
Skin-care and beauty products | | 0 | % | | 4 | %

 
Currently, the Company does not have plans to expand its business beyond the nutritional products and skin-care and beauty sectors, although the Company is now selling products of third-party vendors. We did not make any sales of third-party vendor products during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
Other Products
 
Products of third-party vendors are sold at retail prices similar to those for which the products are being sold by other merchants.

Return and Refund Policy for Our Products
 
Merion guarantees the quality of its products, and will exchange any product found to be defective. Additionally, customers can apply for a 90% refund of the original amount of purchased products within 60 days of purchase. When products are returned, they must be unopened and resalable. All shipping fees for product exchanges or returns must be fully paid by customers. Merion will not be responsible for any shipping costs. All of the returned products must not be damaged and must be within the valid shelf-life period specified on the product label. Products not manufactured by Merion have a 60 day return period for exchange only, without the 90% refund policy for the products. In addition to the Company’s 60-day return policy, the Company, at its discretion, may accept a customer’s application for a buy-back of products previously sold within one year at 90% of the original product costs less commissions and shipping costs.
Marketing: The Affiliate Marketing Program (“AMP”)
 
A description of how the AMP operates is as follows:
 

· | The Company’s website (www.dailynu.com) is an online shopping store, and customers located in China can purchase the products from this website by credit card; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The Affiliate Marketing Program is a performance-based marketing program in which the Company rewards one or more affiliates (the “Affiliate Members”) for each successful customer purchase originated from the Affiliate Members’ own marketing efforts; 
· | The Company provides the Affiliate Members with a URL (or coupon or advertising banner) which can be shared by the Affiliate Members where they choose to post the link. If anyone purchases products from this link, the Company will pay commissions to the relevant Affiliate Members based on the revenue generated from their links; 
· | The Affiliate Members are not employees of the Company; 
· | The Company does not track any customer from the Affiliate Members. The Affiliate Members themselves do not know who will purchase products from the link; 
· | Currently, the Company has two options for the payment of commission rewards. One alternative is that an Affiliate Member may earn 70% of the monthly sales amount generated from his or her affiliate link if that Affiliate Member achieves total sales in an amount that exceeds $10,000 per month. The other alternative pays every Affiliate Member 20% of the monthly sales amount generated from his or her affiliate link; and
· | The commission rewards are in the form of rebate credits that can be used to order the Company’s products, or the Affiliate Members can request a rebate in cash. 

 
Cost-Per-Sale (CPS) Affiliate Marketing
 
The Affiliate Marketing Program appears on its face to utilize the “Cost-Per-Sale” (CPS) marketing method, a popular internet-based marketing method used by e-commerce companies in China. Under the CPS affiliate marketing method, the cost of advertising is determined by the revenue generated as a result of the advertisement itself. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, no commission rebates were awarded to the Affiliate Members under AMP. For the year ended December 31, 2016, $58,400 of commission rebates were awarded to the Affiliate Members under AMP.
 
Sourcing and Production
 
Our Products
 
During the period ended December 31, 2017, we acquired our ingredients from the suppliers and contracted for production of our proprietary products from manufacturers that we believe are reliable, reputable and deliver high quality materials, products and services. In 2017, three suppliers accounted for approximately 94.0% of our purchases: SUSS Technology Corp. (29.3%), Oxyultra Inc. (25.1%), and McGoGene, LLC (39.6%). In 2016, three suppliers accounted for approximately 96.6% of our purchases: SUSS Technology Corp. (17.5%), Prime Nutrisource (34.9%) and Oxymune America (44.2%). The loss of one or more suppliers could result in a potential loss of our sales and revenues if we cannot find a substitute.
 
The Company does not have a written or contractual agreement with our other suppliers or manufacturers. Our product ingredient sourcing and other manufacturing requirements are conducted on a purchase-order basis. If one or more of our current suppliers stopped selling us ingredients and/or if one or more of our current manufacturers stopped manufacturing our products, we would be forced to find other suppliers and manufacturers. The time needed to find other suppliers or manufacturers could outlast the inventory on hand and result in loss of sales.
 
We maintain a good relationship with our suppliers and do not anticipate that any of our suppliers will terminate the relationship in the near term. We also have ongoing relationships with secondary and tertiary suppliers. In the event we become unable to source any products or ingredients from our major suppliers, we believe that we would be able to produce or replace those products or substitute source these ingredients from our secondary and tertiary other suppliers without great difficulty or significant increases to our cost of goods sold.

In January 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with SUSS Technology Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell to the Company substantially all of the assets associated with the manufacture of dietary supplements (the “Asset Sale”) for an aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of $1,000,000 and 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Purchase Shares”). The Seller was one of our major suppliers during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Having purchased these assets from the Seller, we intend to manufacture some of the nutritional supplements that we sell. These assets meet all industry nutritional and dietary supplements manufacturing standards, including FDA and GMP compliance and cGMP regulations. In addition to manufacturing the nutritional supplements that we sell, we also anticipate starting production of hard capsules, tablets, solid beverage (sachet packaging), teabags, powder, granules, dietary supplement export, softgel capsules and healthy food from these assets for any potential new customers who need this product. 
 
Our skin-care and beauty products are developed by a company which owns the intellectual property for those products. We purchased the rebranding right from them to sell these products under our names. Currently we only have one supplier for our skin-care products, and the specific product is solely owned by this supplier. If the supplier were to discontinue this product, we would need to find a substitute supplier for a similar product. We have not identified any substitute supplier or substitute product. Our skin-care and beauty products are produced by our supplier, and we are unable to obtain the intellectual property rights to produce such products.
 
For nutritional products, we purchase our ingredients from third parties and contract with a third-party manufacturer for further processing the material into final products to be sold. We did not own a manufacturing plant for processing of our products prior January 1, 2018. We only provided self-developed formulas to be manufactured. Our company is able to obtain the ingredients necessary for production of our nutritional supplements. 
 
We also maintain a good relationship with our manufacturers and do not anticipate that any of our manufacturers will terminate our relationship in the near term. In the event we become unable have our products manufactured by our major manufacturers, we believe that we would be able to reallocate production to our other manufacturers or locate other manufacturers without great difficulty or significant increases to our cost of goods sold.
 
In addition, we maintain a good relationship with our wholesale distributors in China and do not anticipate that any of our wholesale distributors will terminate our relationship in the near term. In 2017, two customers accounted for approximately 51.2% of our sales: Nanyu Zhu (36.4%) and Meiwen Yu (14.8%). In 2016, one customer accounted for approximately 52.6% of our sales: Nanyu Zhu (52.6%). The loss of one or more customers could result in a potential loss of our sales and a negative effect on our operations if we cannot find one or more substitutes.
 
Other Products
 
We currently acquire other products we sell from third-party vendors on a wholesale basis and then resell them on our website. We acquire most of these products on a purchase order basis. A small amount of products are purchased and stored in our warehouse. No sales and less than 1% of our sales in 2017 and 2016, respectively, came from these products.
Order Backlog
 
We have no current order backlog.
 
Industry Analysis
 
The nutrition industry includes many small and medium sized companies that manufacture and distribute products generally intended to enhance the body’s performance and wellness. The four major product categories within the nutrition industry are:

· | Nutritional Supplements – products such as vitamins, minerals, nutritional supplements, herbs and botanicals and compounds derived from these substances.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Natural and Organic Foods – products such as cereals, milk, non-diary beverages and frozen entrees. 
· | Functional Foods – products with added ingredients or fortification specifically for health or performance purposes. 
· | Skin-care – products combining nutrition with skin care. 


7

 
The nutritional supplement market is characterized by:
 

· | Large selections of essentially similar products that are difficult to differentiate. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Retail consumers’ emphasis on value pricing. 
· | Constantly changing formulations based on evolving scientific research. 
· | Low entry barriers resulting from low brand loyalty, rapid change, widely available manufacturing, low regulatory requirements and ready access to large distribution channels, such as the Internet and retail stores selling nutritional supplements and other direct marketing companies.
· | A lack of uniform standards regarding product ingredient sources, potency, purity, absorption rate and form. 

Competition
 
The market for nutritional products is large and intensely competitive. The Company competes directly with companies that manufacture and market nutritional products. The Company competes with other companies in the nutritional products industry by emphasizing the uniqueness, value and premium quality of the Company's products and convenience of the Company's Internet sales system. Many of the Company's competitors have much greater name recognition and financial resources than the Company. In addition, nutritional products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution. While the Company believes that consumers appreciate the convenience of ordering products from home through the Internet, the buying habits of many consumers accustomed to purchasing products through traditional retail channels are difficult to change. The Company's product offerings are also relatively small compared to the wide variety of products offered by many other nutritional product companies.
Marketing Plan
 
The Company promotes its products through its websites and newspaper advertisements. During the early stages of website implementation, the Company offered coupon codes for certain products to generate sales and website traffic, but has since discontinued this practice.
 
The majority of the Company’s sales were generated from China for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
 
Since June 2014, we mainly sold our products over the Internet directly to end-user customers through our websites, www.dailynu.com and www.merionus.com, and to wholesale distributors. In March 2016, we launched an Affiliate Marketing Program. See Marketing: The Affiliate Marketing Program in the aforementioned section above for more information.
 
In addition, we believe that consumers have become more confident in ordering products like ours, over the Internet. However, the nutritional supplement and skin care product e-business markets have been, and continue to be, increasingly competitive, and are rapidly evolving. 
 
The Company hopes to export its Dibeier Products into China to be sold over-the-counter in retail locations such as nutritional product stores, rather than only through our website. The Company is currently in the process of negotiating with two companies in China to import our Dibeier Products to be sold in such locations. Once one or more sales contracts are secured, the export of Dibeier products will begin, but no assurance can be given that the export of such products will occur in the future. 
 
Share Distribution Plan
 
On March 31, 2017, our board of directors approved the following plans:
 


1) | The Company would grant up to thirty million shares of common stock to certain persons outside of the United States who have previously worked with the Company as an incentive for these individuals to assist the Company to develop its international market. In connection with this transaction, Mr. Wang would voluntarily relinquish up to thirty million shares of common stock owned by him to the Company’s Treasury, and thereafter the Company would issue to persons not citizens or residents of the U.S. an equal number of shares pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933. Accordingly, special legends regarding restrictions on resale of the securities and no-hedging transactions would need to be included on the securities.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | On July 15, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the Company’s withdrawal from plan (1) as approved by the Board on March 31, 2017, as the Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders that Mr. Wang distribute these shares directly to the intended recipients. 1,500,000 shares were transferred by Mr. Wang to these individuals at no cost to them on February 14, 2018. 


8


2) | To thank the people who, directly or indirectly, loaned funds or referred customers to the Company or purchased products from the Company when the Company faced financial hardship, the Company would grant up to five million shares of common stock to these individuals upon approval by the Board of Directors, and the Company would complete the stock transfer. In connection with this transaction, Mr. Wang would voluntarily relinquish up to five million shares of common stock owned by him to the Company’s Treasury. To the extent that these share distributions are being made to anyone outside of the U.S., those distributions will be made under Regulation S and must contain appropriate Regulation S subscription agreements and legends. If anyone within the U.S. is to receive those shares, the Company must consult with the Company counsel to comply with U.S. securities laws.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | On July 28, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the Company’s withdrawal from plan (2) as approved by the Board on March 31, 2017, as the Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders that Mr. Wang distribute these shares directly to the intended recipients. 4,181,592 shares were transferred by Mr. Wang to these individuals at no cost to them on February 14, 2018. 
3) | The Company will grant up to twenty million shares (from authorized but unissued shares of its common stock) to persons outside the U.S. who sell Company products based on their sales performance in the future. The Company must determine that this type of incentive compensation is legal and appropriate for each country in which it is utilized. For ease of administration, this plan will be implemented solely for persons outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933. No shares have been issued under this plan as of the date of this report. 

Intellectual Property
 
We have no registered or patents in the United States. We have common law ownership rights under U.S. law and business/trade secrets for the formulations for six of our twelve Nutritional Supplements except O2 Cell Power, Hapaticia, Antigrey, Auxia, Capsule of Beauty and Cell Vitality. We do not have any intellectual property rights for the formulations of all of our eight skin-care and beauty products.
 
The formulation of the O2 Cell Power product is owned by Oxygen America, Inc., which manufactures this product and packages it with Company designed packaging under an oral agreement with us. The formulation of Hapaticia, Antigrey, Auxia, Capsule of Beauty and Cell Vitality is owned by McGoGene, LLC, which manufactures these products and packages them with Company designed packaging under an oral agreement with us. Seven of our eight skin-care and beauty products, excluding Noir Naturel, have formulation patents owned by our supplier of these products, Genepharm Inc., which manufactures these products and packages them with Company designed packaging under an oral agreement with us. The formulation of Noir Naturel is owned by McGoGene, LLC, which manufactures this product and packages it with Company designed packaging under an oral agreement with us. We are authorized by these suppliers under oral agreements to sell these products worldwide under our brand name without infringing any rights of Genepharm, Oxygen America, Inc., or McGoGene, LLC.
 
The Company has obtained in China a Trademark Registration for the name of “Dibeier” (or mandarin pinyin: “Nuo Lin”) with trademark application number 20669799. Under China law, this trademark is valid for an indefinite period, as there is no expiration date. 
 
The Company has obtained in China a Trademark Registration for the name of “DailyNu” with trademark application number 20683305. Under China law, this trademark is valid for an indefinite period, as there is no expiration date. 
 
Other than the aforementioned trademarks, we do not own any other registered trademarks, trade names or other governmentally approved intellectual property rights for those products.
 
Research and Development
 
As of January 2018, we are internally developing an online platform called “E-Hospital”. E-Hospital provides the latest and the most advanced US health care information and products, including legally exported nutrition supplements and newly-released medication for local hospitals and other medical institutes in China through the internet. We are in the process of contacting doctors who will be partnering with our E-Hospital platform to provide periodical video consultation and overseas medical lectures to promote the exchange of medical information and developments. The collaboration of E-hospital with overseas local hospitals will strengthen the recognition, popularity and reputation of overseas local hospitals, as well as expanding the market share and increasing the competitiveness of these hospitals. 
 
The E-Hospital Services will provide the following benefits:
 
 
· | High quality remote treatment anywhere, to suit individual lifestyles; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Medication delivered directly to patients; 
· | Access to the latest US medical treatments; 
· | An internet forum for communication and sharing between doctors and doctors, doctors and patients, or patient to patient; and 
· | Access to safe and high quality nutritional supplements, which are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in polluted countries such as China.

The E-Hospital Services will also include the following:
 
 
· | Access to effective advanced medication, therapeutic nutritional supplements and health products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Access to cutting-edge medical health knowledge; 
· | Prescriptions, legally issued by all E-Hospital affiliated doctors; 
· | Featured services and new medications promoted by our local hospital partners; 
· | Live video consultations with U.S. doctors; 
· | Medical lectures; and 
· | Product shipping and customer service. 

 
As we are currently developing the E-hospital platform, we do not have an estimate for when we will ready to launch the platform. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully to launch the platform. 
 
Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $1,310 and $0, respectively. 
 
Government Regulation
 
Given uncertainties relating to our compliance with personal network marketing laws in foreign jurisdictions, the Company discontinued sales through the network marketing model in 2014, and began selling directly to end-user customers from our new website. 
 
We believe we are no longer subject to personal network marketing regulations. Nonetheless, we are still subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations. Various governmental agencies have an impact on our business, including but not limited to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The regulations cover product ingredients, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sales, compensation and taxation, to name a few. All of our products have certificates of free issued by the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. If the Company were to fail to meet standards set by these regulations, then the Company could be prohibited from selling its products.
 
The Company plans to export its Dibeier Products into China to be sold over-the-counter in retail locations such as nutritional product stores, rather than only through our websites. Under China law, to import these products into China, the Company must provide the Inspection Report from the Provincial Quality Supervision and Inspection Institution. In November and December 2016, our Dibeier Granules & Oral products successfully passed inspection by the Shenzhen Academy of Metrology & Quality Inspection and the Guangdong Quality Supervision and Inspection Institution for Food (Shenzhen). The Company also obtained the Product Chinese Name registration from local SAIC and the trademark registration in September 2016 from the Trademark Office of State Administration for Industry & Commerce of China (“SAIC”). The Company currently has no binding contracts or agreements with any person or entity in China to purchase and import the Dibeier Products. The Company is currently reviewing U.S. and Chinese import/export regulations regarding the sale of Dibeier Products and will not commence the export and sale of Dibeier Products until it believes that it is fully in compliance with these regulations.
