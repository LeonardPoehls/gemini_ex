ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Background of Jamba, Inc.
 Jamba, Inc. through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Jamba Juice Company, is a healthful lifestyle brand that inspires and simplifies healthful living through freshly blended whole fruit and vegetable smoothies, bowls, juices, cold-pressed shots, boosts, snacks, and meal replacements. Jamba’s blends are made with premium ingredients free of artificial flavors and preservatives so guests can feel their best and blend the most into life. Our global business is driven by a portfolio of franchised and company-owned Jamba Juice® stores. 
 In November 2014, the Company announced an accelerated transition to an asset-light model. Since the announcement we have refranchised approximately 200 Company stores, which is designed to facilitate a more flexible cost structure reduce capital expenditures and focus on unit growth initiatives. We completed our move to an asset-light model and we now have 94% of our locations owned by experienced franchisees.  
 As of January 2, 2018, there were 873 Jamba Juice stores globally, consisting of 53 Company-owned and operated stores, all located in the United States (“Company Stores”), 749 franchisee-owned and operated stores (“Franchise Stores”) in the United States and 71 Franchise Stores in international locations (“International Stores”), collectively the (“Jamba System”). Currently, 6% of our stores are owned and operated by the Company and 94% of our stores are owned and operated by franchisees.
 In 1990, Kirk Perron founded Juice Club to inspire and simplify healthy living. Since 1991, the Company has been operating as Jamba Juice. Jamba, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on January 6, 2005 as a blank check company formed to serve as a vehicle for the acquisition of an operating business. On July 6, 2005, Jamba, Inc. consummated its initial public offering. On March 10, 2006, Jamba, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Jamba Juice Company, which was completed on November 29, 2006. 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, Jamba, Inc., the registrant, together with Jamba Juice Company, are referred to in this Form 10-K annual report (“Form 10-K”) as the “Company”, “Jamba Juice”, “Jamba”, “we”, “us” and “our.” Information regarding the Company’s fiscal periods is included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 Fiscal Year
 Our fiscal year ends each year on the Tuesday closest to December 31st and therefore we have a 52 or 53 week fiscal year. Fiscal Year 2017 was a 52 week fiscal year, ended on January 2, 2018. Fiscal Year 2016 was a 53 week fiscal year and ended on January 3, 2017, with the fourth quarter comprised of 13 weeks while fiscal year 2015 was a 52 week fiscal year and ended on December 29, 2015.
Our Stores
 We operate a portfolio of flexible store formats that are utilized in different venues. We generally categorize our stores as either traditional, non-traditional or drive thru locations. A traditional location is characterized as a business premise that exists primarily as a Jamba Juice store. Traditional stores average approximately 1,200 - 1,300 square feet in size. These stores are located either in major urban centers or in suburban strip mall centers, either as in-line or standalone. We announced a franchise incentive program designed to accelerate new store openings in 2017, including our new Drive-Thru format which is intended to increase sales, improve unit level economics and expand our available trade-areas by increasing accessibility to the market. We believe this program will spur additional growth of the incentivized store formats. As of January 2, 2018, there were 614 traditional Jamba Juice store locations. A non-traditional location is characterized as a Jamba Juice store located within another primary business, in conjunction with another business or at institutional settings, such as colleges and universities, entertainment venues, shopping malls, transportation centers, supermarkets, airports and Express concept. A “captive” audience is a common characteristic of non-traditional locations. We believe one benefit of the development of non-traditional stores is to increase awareness of the Jamba Juice brand to complement the traditional stores in the area. As of January 2, 2018, there were 188 non-traditional Jamba Juice store locations.

The Jamba Juice Express concept was launched in 2012. The concept is designed to target venues with a smaller footprint than our historical, non-traditional store. Jamba Juice Express units offer a limited menu of the brand’s top selling smoothies and juices as compared to our other store formats. Our Jamba Juice Express platform is an in-fill strategy for venues such as colleges and universities, grocery stores, hospitals and business cafeterias where the Jamba brand is already a known presence in the market. As of January 2, 2018, there were 49 Jamba Juice Express locations open in 19 states. Due to the nature of the business format and smaller footprint, an Express unit generates a smaller financial store contribution than other formats. To better reflect the key contributors of new store development, Express units were excluded from store counts, beginning in the first quarter of 2017.
 We continue to evaluate the design of traditional and non-traditional stores. Our goal is to vary the size and format of our stores to allow us to locate them in or near a variety of settings. Our flexibility in store construction enables us to develop stores in a wide range of venues, increasing the visibility of the Jamba brand and providing customers easy and convenient access. We believe format flexibility helps us attract qualified franchisees and offer them the potential to earn a higher return on their investment in capital expenditures.
 As of January 2, 2018, we had 802 Jamba Juice store locations in the United States, operating in 33 states and Washington, D.C., consisting of 53 Company Stores and 749 Franchise Stores. During fiscal year 2017, 39 new Franchise Stores opened, 29 Franchise Stores closed, 13 Company Stores were refranchised, one new Company Store was opened and one Company Store was closed.
 Franchising 
 As a franchisor, the Company grants a franchisee to operate Jamba Juice stores in a given area, with or without exclusivity. The franchisee pays the Company for its use of our concept, strategy, marketing, operating systems, purchasing power, and brand recognition. The franchisees are solely responsible for the day-to-day operations in each franchised restaurant, including labor and employment decisions, such as hiring, terminations, scheduling, and setting wages, determining benefits and all other terms of employment with respect to their employees.
Domestic
 Through our franchising program, we offer franchisees choices in store location, format and the number of stores they wish to operate including traditional and non-traditional store formats. We also offer franchisees the opportunity to reserve larger territories by entering into multi-store development agreements, which grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop and operate a specified number of stores within a specified period of time and geographic area. Development fees are typically equal to one-half the initial franchise fee per store. 
 For each franchised restaurant, we enter into a franchise agreement covering standard terms and conditions. The typical franchise agreement in the U.S. has a 10-year initial term. Franchisees pay us an initial franchise fee for the right to operate a restaurant, typically $10,000 to $35,000, depending on the store format and whether or not a multi-store agreement was also executed. All franchisees also are required to pay continuing royalty fees. The royalty fees are calculated on total net sales of each store and typically range from 5.5% to 6%, depending on the store format. Marketing program contributions are also required for traditional store formats. Marketing program contributions charged typically range from 3% to 4% of the franchisee store’s net sales. 
 Our comprehensive market planning and site selection process helps guide the successful execution of our growth strategy. We have processes for identifying, analyzing and assigning undeveloped markets for Franchise Store development. Once a market is selected, we carefully screen trade areas for demand based on demographic, psychographic and Jamba Juice specific variables to ensure that they meet our guidelines for new store development and begin the site selection or approval process. Once a trade area is approved, we carefully screen prospective locations for visibility, traffic patterns, ease-of-use, occupancy costs and co-tenancy for potential Franchise Store locations. Our expansion strategy involves using this market planning and site selection process to leverage areas of demand within each market. We use this approach as a means to create critical mass within specific geographic areas of demand, in order to increase brand awareness and improve operating and marketing efficiencies for Franchise Stores while leveraging the costs associated with regional supervision. Distribution efficiencies can also be realized through this strategy.

We partner with franchisees to ensure excellence in Franchise Store operations, principally through our Franchise Business Consultants ("FBCs"). FBCs are Company team members that work closely with franchise owners to review the financial health, strength of the team, best practices and procedures of our franchisees. We engage with our system through a Franchise Advisory Council (“FAC”), which formalizes a channel of communication through a representative group of franchisees to provide advice, counsel and input to us on all aspects impacting our business. Our franchise agreement calls for franchise partners to meet certain operational and maintenance requirements intended to align the operating processes system-wide around a common set of standards. Performance is monitored regularly by the FBCs, who in addition to ensuring operational standards, provide feedback, coaching and support, as needed.
 As of January 2, 2018, we had 23 development agreements that contain rights to develop additional Franchise Stores. The exclusive territories covered by these agreements include selected markets in the states of Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Utah and Washington. We have identified certain markets where a single-unit, owner-operator model may be the preferred way to increase brand awareness while expanding the brand eastward with new store openings. We anticipate increased recruiting efforts in the Texas, Colorado, Florida and Virginia/DC markets accordingly.
 International 
 We continued our international expansion in our Asia and Middle East markets. Our international franchisees operate under a franchise agreement, multi-store development agreements and market opening services agreements. Our international developer agreements take the form of development and franchise agreements under which we typically receive an initial territory fee, store opening fees and ongoing royalty revenues based on a percentage of sales. The typical international agreement has a 10-year term. Franchisees pay us an initial franchise fee for the right to operate a restaurant, typically $10,000 to $35,000, under a multi-store and market services agreement. The multi-store development agreements grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop and operate a specified number of stores, within a specified period of time, within their operating country. Development fees are typically equal to one-half the initial franchise fee per store. Market opening service agreements provide the franchisee the support necessary to establish the initial operating infrastructure within that country, including assistance with product development, marketing, supply chain, store design and store operations. All international franchisees also are required to pay continuing royalty fees. The royalty fees are calculated on total net sales of the store and typically range from 5.5% to 6%, depending on the store format. 
 Our international partners work closely with us to build the Jamba Juice brand and implement the Jamba Juice system in their local geographic markets, as well as to maximize revenue and margin growth opportunities, recognizing commercial, cultural and dietary diversity in each market. There were 71 International Stores, 8% of total global stores, as of January 2, 2018, with stores located in South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, the Middle East, Indonesia and Thailand. At the end of fiscal 2017, we had international master development agreements with partners in South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates).
 We believe our brand and products have international appeal and we continue to engage in discussions with additional interested partners regarding the expansion of Jamba Juice stores into new international markets in Asia Pacific and the GCC. The success of further international expansion will depend on, among other things, local acceptance of the Jamba Juice concept and menu offerings, regional supply chain infrastructure to drive profitable growth for our partners and our ability to attract qualified franchise partners. 
 Company stores 
 We operate 53 Company-owned stores, primarily in the Southern California market. It is our intention to retain our Company-owned stores for their contribution to the Company’s financial performance and as a test platform used to explore initiatives that we may want to extend system-wide. Our field and store operations teams are responsible for maximizing the performance of our Company Stores across the system. We recruit and retain leaders with broad experience in management within our industry. Our field leadership consists of two Operational Directors and District Managers to support our Company Store operations. Our strong core values have attracted a tenured field team that is highly experienced and invested in the health of the business and the brand.

Our Store Excellence Program is designed to improve operational execution and performance by establishing the comprehensive standards expected at all of our stores. In addition, we offer a bonus program to Company Store managers based on achieving sales and profit goals. We believe these standards and programs positively impact customer satisfaction and ensure that all stores in the Jamba System are developing consistent customer satisfaction. We believe team members are the key to our success and support the development of a culture that fosters personal interaction, mutual respect, trust, empowerment, enthusiasm and commitment.
 Maintaining a culture and a management style that embodies healthy, active lifestyles in an authentic, fun, friendly and efficient manner in Company Stores, as well as Franchise Stores, is essential as we continue to expand, and we believe that it is critical to developing our brand and ensuring our continued success.
 Training 
 Our training programs ensure all team members in the system have the knowledge needed to deliver excellence in guest experience and connect team members to our mission.  We conduct training through a variety of programs for franchise partners, team members, support center staff and our leadership team on a regular basis. We are dedicated to providing a meaningful experience for all employees, with ample opportunity to develop leadership skills as they build a career at Jamba. All of our training programs reinforce the importance of prioritizing the guest experience and building sales through menu knowledge. Training materials and best practices are available to our franchisees to help create, preserve and support a singular culture of excellence within all of the stores that comprise our system. The training programs are supplemented by an online training resources, Launchpad, designed to elevate engagement and deliver timely and cost effective training resources to our team and franchise partners.
Recruiting and Retention 
 We carefully screen potential team members to ensure that they embody our core values and fit into our culture. By maintaining this emphasis and encouraging responsibility and accountability at every level, we believe that we have created a sense of team member loyalty and an open and interactive work environment, resulting in a highly passionate workforce. Our team members are paid competitive wages and are offered opportunities for advancement. In addition to competitive wages, store managers are eligible for performance-based bonuses. In order to preserve a singular culture within the stores that comprise the Jamba System, we share best practice information, qualifications and other relevant information to assist franchisees with hiring and retention.
Advertising and Marketing 
 In fiscal 2017, much of our advertising and marketing efforts focused on product innovation and the continued refinement of our digital eco-system. Through a variety of product centric innovations, we focused consumers’ attention on the fresh fruits and vegetables that are used to make Jamba juices, smoothies and bowls, underscoring our commitment to providing healthier food and beverage options and fulfilling our mission of inspiring and simplifying healthy living. We continued our investment in our loyalty program and refined our on-line-ordering solution.  
 Jamba marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote the Jamba brand image and differentiate it from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on providing consumers with simple, easy-to-adopt solutions for pursuing a healthy active lifestyle and we continuously endeavor to improve our social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability. We believe our marketing efforts in fiscal 2017 extended our reach and relevance to consumers. 
 Product Supply 
 We are committed to providing only the finest smoothies, juices, bowls and other food products. Smoothie, juice and bowl products depend heavily upon supplies of fresh and individually quick-frozen (“IQF”) fruit and vegetables. We have an established nationwide fresh produce supply chain in order to facilitate our made-to-order freshly squeezed juice platform. The quality of each beverage depends to a large degree on the quality of the basic fruit and vegetable ingredients from which it is made. It is essential that the supply of fruit and vegetables is of the 
 7


highest quality and is consistent throughout the year. To achieve these goals, we purchase our projected requirements for the coming year from suppliers at the height of the season. The supply and price of fresh and IQF fruit and vegetables are dependent upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and are subject to volatility. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing regions, including weather, natural disasters and national/regional political and economic conditions.
 We buy certain produce and dairy using fixed priced or to-be-fixed priced purchase commitments to secure adequate supply of quality ingredients for our products. As a result, we have purchase obligations with certain suppliers for certain produce and dairy for various terms typically ranging from one year to three years. We depend on our relationships with our suppliers for our supply of produce, dairy and other products. While two distributors accounted for approximately 90% of the supplies delivered to our Company Stores, and also service our Franchise Stores, we believe, based on our established relationships with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on our purchase commitments is remote.
 Our supply chain organization is funded by all stores across the Jamba System. This funding contributes to the cost of system-wide procurement and management of our supplies and supports our suppliers. The program allows for cost recovery of certain products purchased by Company Stores and Franchise Stores.
 Competition 
 The retail beverage and food industry remains highly competitive and fragmented. Stores compete based on a number of factors, including quality, price-value relationships, customer service, name recognition, employee hiring and retention and location. We compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of beverage and food products, including quick service restaurants/fast food establishments, coffee shops, juice bars, donut shops, frozen yogurt shops and grocery stores. Competition in the beverage and food market is fragmented, and increasingly so, and a major competitor with substantially greater resources than us could enter the market at any time and compete directly against Jamba Juice stores. 
 We compete most directly with regional smoothie stores, most of which are franchises of other smoothie brands. The rising popularity of convenient and healthy food items resulted in increased competition from non-smoothie retailers as they increased their offerings of smoothies and other juice-related products. As we increase our food offerings, we have placed ourselves into direct competition with other quick serve food concepts with well established businesses.
 Additionally, we face increasing competition from specialty juice bars and stores, which focus on made-to-order juices, juice blends, cold-press juices and fasting/cleansing packages. Many of these brands have cold-press direct-to-consumer capabilities that multiply the geographic reaches of their stores.
 We also face intense competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for suitable sites for new stores and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores. There can be no assurance that we or our franchisees will be able to continue to secure adequate sites at acceptable rent levels or that we or franchisees will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel to operate our stores.
 Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 
 Government Regulation.  We and our franchisees are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations relating to public health and safety and zoning codes. We operate each of our stores in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations. However, if we or our franchisees could not obtain or retain food or other licenses, it would adversely affect our operations. Although we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, any significant difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a particular store or group of stores.

California and other states and local jurisdictions have enacted laws, rules, regulations and ordinances which may apply to the operation of a Company Store or a Franchise Store, including those which (a) establish general standards, specifications and requirements for the construction, design and maintenance of the store premises; (b) regulate matters affecting the health, safety and welfare of our customers, such as general health and sanitation requirements for restaurants; employee practices concerning the storage, handling, cooking and preparation of food; special health, food service and licensing requirements; restrictions on smoking; exposure to tobacco smoke or other carcinogens or reproductive toxicants and saccharin; availability of and requirements for public accommodations, including restrooms; (c) set standards pertaining to employee health and safety and mandatory health insurance; (d) set standards and requirements for fire safety and general emergency preparedness; (e) regulate the proper use, storage and disposal of waste, insecticides and other hazardous materials; (f) establish general requirements or restrictions on advertising containing false or misleading claims, or health and nutrient claims on menus or otherwise, such as “low calorie”, “healthy” or “organic”; (g) establish requirements concerning withholdings and employee reporting of taxes on tips; (h) regulate the amount or type of ingredients in food and beverages; and (i) regulate or ban the use of particular packaging materials.
 In order to develop and construct more stores, we, or our franchisees, need to comply with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. Federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date, but expansion of our menu offerings or more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs for new stores. We, and our franchisees, are also required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, which generally prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability. We may, in the future, have to modify stores, for example, by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. While these expenses could be material, our current expectation is that any such action will not require us to expend substantial funds.
 We are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and various federal and state laws governing various matters including minimum wages, overtime meal and rest periods, accommodations to certain employees and other working conditions. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. In addition, we and our franchisees pay a significant number of our hourly staff at rates consistent with, but higher than, the applicable federal, state or local minimum wage. Accordingly, increases in the minimum wage would increase our labor cost. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to our current and any future franchise operations. See “Risk Factors - Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.”
 We are also subject to various federal and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensor-licensee relationships. Many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreement, including the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply. The Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, and some state laws also require that the franchisor furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document that contains prescribed information and, in some instances, require the franchisor to register the franchise offering.
 Environmental Matters 
 We and our franchisees are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the use of, among others, polystyrene products, and several counties in which our stores are located have already banned the use of our polystyrene cups. We continued to make progress on certain eco-sustainability initiatives first launched in 2009, including phasing out the use of polystyrene cups, as well as increasing the use of recyclable products and reducing waste. At the beginning of 2016 we launched plastic cups, which are more easily recycled than the double-walled coated paper cups we introduced in 2013. Our other green initiatives include the use of more environmentally friendly packaging for our cup carriers, oatmeal cups and lids, breakfast clear cups and lids, spoons and napkins, all of which are made from recycled material. We have also reduced the amount of corrugated cardboard used for bulk shipping, reduced labeling requirements, and reduced freight, resulting in lower fuel emissions. We have established several optimization programs to reduce waste, such as participation in recycling and composting programs for our food waste, where it is feasible for us to do so.

Trademarks and Domain Names 
 We own and/or have applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the United States and in other jurisdictions throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Jamba Juice ® and the Jamba logo are of material importance to the Company. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. In addition, the Company has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “jamba.com” and “jambajuice.com”.
 Management Information Systems 
 Each Company Store has computerized point-of-sale registers, which collect transaction data used to generate pertinent information, including sales transactions and product mix. Additionally, the point-of-sale system is used to authorize, batch and settle credit card data. All product prices are programmed into the point-of-sale register from the Company’s corporate office. Franchise Stores generally use the same point-of-sale registers as Company Stores, but may elect to use alternative systems provided Company approval and certain information is shared with the Company. Franchisees set their own menu prices, usually with guidance from the Company.
 Company Stores use the Company’s licensed labor management software to record employee time clock information, schedule labor and provide management reports. Company Stores and many Franchise Stores use the Company’s licensed food cost management software to improve inventory management and provide management reports.
 Our continued focus on technological and procedural enhancements, in areas such as labor and inventory management, has relieved our store managers from manual administrative tasks and enables them to better focus on delivering exceptional customer service.
 Seasonality 
 Our business is subject to day-to-day volatility based on weather and varies by season. A significant portion of the Company’s revenue is realized during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year, which include the summer months. The fourth quarter of the fiscal year, which encompasses the winter months and the holiday season, has traditionally been our lowest revenue volume quarter. Our business will likely continue to be subject to seasonal patterns for the foreseeable future, given that the largest portion of our sales continues to be from the sale of smoothies during the warmer parts of the year. Because of the seasonality of the business, results for an individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results, which may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
