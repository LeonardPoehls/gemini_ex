Item 1. Business
Overview
In February 2017 we changed our name from “FXCM Inc.” to “Global Brokerage, Inc.” Global Brokerage, Inc. (“Global Brokerage” or the “Company”) is a publicly traded company which, through its holding company, Global Brokerage Holdings, LLC (“Holdings”) (f/k/a FXCM Holdings, LLC), owns 50.1% of FXCM Group, LLC. Through FXCM Group, LLC we are an online provider of foreign exchange (“FX”) trading and related services to over 178,000 active retail accounts globally as of December 31, 2016. We offer our customers access to over-the-counter (“OTC”) FX markets and have developed a proprietary technology platform that we believe provides our customers with an efficient and cost-effective way to trade FX. In an FX trade, a participant buys one currency and simultaneously sells another, a combination known as a “currency pair.” Our platform seeks to present our FX customers with the best price quotations on 45 currency pairs from global banks, financial institutions and market makers (“FX market makers”). We also offer our non-U.S. customers the ability to trade contracts-for-difference (“CFDs”).
Our operating subsidiaries are regulated in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States (“U.S.”), including the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), where regulatory passport rights have been exercised to operate in a number of European Economic Area jurisdictions, and Australia. We maintain offices in these jurisdictions, among others. We offer our trading software in 17 languages and provide customer support in 15 languages. In early 2017, as described further below, we withdrew from business in the U.S. and, on February 7, 2017, agreed to sell all of our U.S.-domiciled customer accounts to Gain Capital Group, LLC. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 81.8% of our retail customer trading volume was derived from customers residing outside the U.S. We believe our global footprint provides us with access to emerging markets, diversifies our risk from regional economic conditions and allows us to draw our employees from a broad pool of talent.
We deploy two types of execution models in order to optimize customer experience, enhance our risk management program and increase trading revenue. For clients with high balances and aggressive or high risk trading strategies, we offer no dealing desk (NDD), or agency, execution, where when our customer executes a trade on the best price quotation offered by our FX market makers, we act as a credit intermediary, or riskless principal, simultaneously entering into offsetting trades with both the customer and the FX market maker. The agency model has the effect of hedging our positions and eliminating market risk exposure. We offer a dealing desk, or principal, execution model to smaller retail clients. Under the dealing desk model, we maintain our trading position and do not offset the trade with another party on a one for one basis. CFDs are primarily a dealing desk offering. By combining smaller positions and trading them out on an aggregate basis, we are able to optimize revenues from accounts that are less actively traded. Generally, under both models, we earn trading fees through commissions or by adding a markup to the price provided by the FX market makers. In certain geographic locations, we provide our customers with the price provided by the FX market makers and display trading fees and commissions separately. Revenues earned under the dealing desk model also include our realized and unrealized foreign currency trading gains or losses on our positions with customers. 
We also earn other forms of revenue such as fees earned from: white label arrangements with other financial institutions to provide platform, back office and trade execution services, FX market prices and other various ancillary FX related services and joint ventures.
We operate our business in a single segment, retail trading. In addition, we own a 50.1% controlling interest in each of Lucid Markets Trading Limited (“Lucid”), an electronic market-maker and trader in the institutional foreign exchange spot and futures market, and V3 Markets (“V3”), an electronic market-maker and trader of a diverse set of products. Both Lucid and V3 are reflected as held for sale in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sale of U.S.-domiciled Customer Accounts
On February 7, 2017, Forex Capital Markets, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of FXCM Group, LLC, in which we have a 50.1% interest, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which Forex Capital Markets, LLC agreed to sell substantially all of its U.S.-domiciled customer accounts to Gain Capital Group, LLC (the “Buyer”). In consideration for the purchase of the accounts, Buyer has agreed, during the 153-day period following the closing date of the Asset Purchase Agreement (the “153-Day Period”), to pay Global Brokerage (i) five hundred ($500) dollars for each transferred client account for which the transferred client account opens at least one new trade during the first 76 calendar days of the 153-Day Period, and (ii) two hundred and fifty ($250) dollars for each transferred client account for which the 
1

transferred client opens at least one new trade during the period from the 77th day through the 153rd day of the 153-Day Period. The closing took place on February 24, 2017.
Events of January 15, 2015
On January 15, 2015, the Company’s customers suffered significant losses and generated negative equity balances (“debit balances”) owed to it of approximately $275.1 million. This was due to the unprecedented volatility in the EUR/CHF currency pair after the SNB discontinued its currency floor of 1.2 CHF per EUR on that date. These debit balances resulted in a temporary breach of certain regulatory capital requirements. 
On January 28, 2015, we issued a press release announcing a decision to forgive approximately 90% of the clients who incurred debit balances in certain jurisdictions as a result of the SNB announcement on January 15, 2015. We notified certain clients (such as institutional, high net worth and experienced traders who generally maintain higher account balances) that sustained debit balances as a result of the market events on January 15, 2015, that they will be required to pay their debit balances, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s master trading agreements. This group represents approximately 10% of clients who incurred debit balances, but comprises over 60% of the total debit balances owed. We made the decision in the second quarter of 2015 to forgive the debit balances of additional retail clients, increasing the total debit balance forgiveness to approximately 97% of clients, and to return certain recoveries totaling approximately $0.1 million. Approximately 3% of clients remain who were previously notified that they will be required to pay their debit balances, which comprises approximately 10% of the total debit balances owed as a result of the events on January 15, 2015. In light of the numerous uncertainties associated with collection options, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in recovering any portion of the clients’ debit balances. We have recovered $0.1 million and $9.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In January 2017, we forgave the remaining debit balances owed.
Leucadia Financing
On January 16, 2015, Holdings and FXCM Newco, LLC (“Newco”) entered into a credit agreement (as subsequently amended, the “Credit Agreement”) with Leucadia National Corporation (“Leucadia”), as administrative agent and lender, and a related financing fee agreement (the “Fee Letter”). The financing provided to the Company pursuant to these agreements enabled the Company to maintain compliance with regulatory capital requirements and continue operations. On January 16, 2015, the Corporation, Holdings, Newco and Leucadia also entered into an agreement (as subsequently amended, the “Letter Agreement”) that set the terms and conditions upon which the Corporation, Holdings and Newco will pay in cash to Leucadia and its assignees a percentage of the proceeds received in connection with certain transactions. In connection with these financing transactions, Holdings formed Newco and contributed all of the equity interests owned by Holdings in its subsidiaries to Newco. 
Restructuring Transaction
On September 1, 2016, the Company and Leucadia agreed to amend the terms of the Credit Agreement and to terminate the Letter Agreement. FXCM Newco, LLC was renamed FXCM Group, LLC (“Group”), and the Letter Agreement was replaced with an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of FXCM Group, LLC (the “Group Agreement”). Pursuant to the Group Agreement, Leucadia acquired a 49.9% membership interest in Group, with Holdings owning the remaining 50.1% membership interest. Group and Holdings also entered into a Management Agreement (the “Management Agreement”) pursuant to which Holdings manages the assets and day-to-day operations of Group and thereby retains control of Group. Additionally, Group adopted the 2016 Incentive Bonus Plan for Founders and Executives (the “Management Incentive Plan”), under which participants are entitled to certain distributions made after the principal and interest under the amended Credit Agreement are repaid. The events described herein are collectively referred to as the "Restructuring Transaction".
Principal Changes to the Credit Agreement
In connection with the Restructuring Transaction, we entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which extends the maturity date of the term loan by one year to January 16, 2018. Additionally, as amended, the Credit Agreement permits the Company to defer any three of the remaining interest payments by paying interest in kind. Until the borrowings under the amended Credit Agreement are fully repaid, all distributions (with limited exception) and sales proceeds will continue to be used solely to repay the principal plus interest.
2

On February 22, 2017, Group, Holdings and Leucadia entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement pursuant to which the aggregate principal outstanding balance of the Credit Agreement was increased by $3.5 million in consideration of Leucadia’s waiver of certain sections of the Credit Agreement regarding restricted payments and distributions.
Principal Changes to the Letter Agreement
Pursuant to the Restructuring Transaction, the Letter Agreement was terminated effective September 1, 2016 and the parties signed the Group Agreement. The Group Agreement provides that Group will be governed by a six-member board of directors, comprising three directors appointed by Leucadia and three directors appointed by the Company. The Group Agreement specifies the terms according to which the cash distributions and earnings or losses of Group are to be allocated to its members (the “Revised Waterfall”), which is described below. Pursuant to the Group Agreement, Leucadia and the Company will each have the right to request the sale of Group after January 16, 2018, subject to both Leucadia and the Company accepting the highest reasonable sales price.
Management Agreement
Leucadia has agreed to the Management Agreement with Holdings with an initial term through January 15, 2018, renewable automatically for successive one-year periods, unless terminated. In the Management Agreement, a number of rights are granted unilaterally to Holdings as the manager, including the right to create and implement a detailed budget, appoint and terminate the executive officers of Group and make day-to-day decisions in the ordinary course. 
On February 2, 2017, the Management Agreement was amended to provide Board Members (as defined therein) with certain rights of termination. Specifically, the Management Agreement may now be terminated by a vote of at least three members of the Group Board after the occurrence of certain events, including a change of control.
Management Incentive Plan
In connection with the Restructuring Transaction, the Company adopted the 2016 Incentive Bonus Plan for Founders and Executives (the "Management Incentive Plan") effective September 1, 2016 (“Effective Date”). The Management Incentive Plan is a long-term incentive program with a five-year vesting period, with 25% vesting on the second anniversary of the Effective Date and each of the next three anniversaries thereafter. Distributions under the plan will be made only after the principal and interest under the amended Credit Agreement are repaid and will equal the distributions to Management noted below in the Revised Waterfall. 
Long-term incentive plan participants will receive their share of any distributions or sales proceeds while unvested. A participant that terminates other than for cause will receive either a non-voting membership interest in Group that entitles the participant to the same share of distributions that would have otherwise been received under the incentive program, or a lump-sum cash payment, at the Company's discretion. A participant that terminates for cause will not be entitled to distributions following such termination and will forfeit all interests under the Management Incentive Plan. A termination payment will also be paid upon any change of control of Group. 
On February 2, 2017, Group and Leucadia entered into an acknowledgment pursuant to which the parties agree that Leucadia may terminate the Management Incentive Plan on behalf of Group at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion.

Allocations of Group Distributions (Revised Waterfall)
The contractual provisions in the Group Agreement specify how certain distributions from Group are to be allocated among Leucadia, the Company and the Company’s senior management members participating in the Management Incentive Plan (the “Revised Waterfall”). The distributions include net proceeds received in connection with certain transactions, including sales of assets, dividends or other capital distributions, the sale of Group (whether by merger, stock purchase, sale of all or substantially all of Group’s assets or otherwise), the issuance of any debt or equity securities, and other specified non-ordinary course events, such as certain tax refunds and litigation proceeds. The Revised Waterfall will result in the following distributions from Group:

Distributable Amount | Revised Waterfall 
Amounts due under the Credit Agreement | 100% Leucadia 
Next $350 million | 45% Leucadia / 45% Holdings / 10.0% Management 
Next $500 million | 79.2% Leucadia / 8.8% Holdings / 12.0% Management 
All aggregate amounts thereafter | 51.6% Leucadia / 34.4% Holdings / 14.0% Management

Credit Agreement
Other than the changes described above, the principal terms of the Credit Agreement remain unchanged. The Credit Agreement provides for a $300.0 million term loan made by Leucadia to Holdings and Newco.  
The loan has an initial interest rate of 10% per annum, increasing by 1.5% per annum each quarter for so long as it is outstanding, but in no event exceeding 20.5% per annum (before giving effect to any applicable default rate). The Company has the right to defer any three of the remaining interest payments by paying interest in kind. The Company has not deferred any interest payments to date.
The Credit Agreement requires the payment of a deferred financing fee in an amount equal to $10.0 million, with an additional fee of up to $30.0 million payable in the event the aggregate principal amount of the term loan outstanding on April 16, 2015 was greater than $250.0 million or the deferred financing fee of $10.0 million (plus interest) had not been paid on or before such date. Prior to April 16, 2015, the Company repaid approximately $56.5 million which reduced the aggregate principal to $243.5 million on April 16, 2015. Additionally, the Company paid the $10.0 million deferred financing fee prior to April 16, 2015. Accordingly, the Company was not obligated to pay the additional $30.0 million fee. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has paid $155.5 million of principal, of which $10.0 million was applied to the deferred financing fee.
Disposition of Non-Core Assets

Subsequent to the events of January 15, 2015, we undertook a strategic initiative to sell non-core assets. Throughout 2015, we completed or entered into agreements for the disposition of non-core assets including the sales of the equity trading business of FXCM Securities Limited, FXCM Asia Limited, FXCM Japan Securities, Co., Ltd., and the operations of Faros. We continue to explore opportunities for the sale of additional non-core assets, including Lucid, V3 and our equity interest in FastMatch, Inc., which are reflected as held for sale in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
At-the-Market Securities Offering
On October 3, 2016, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC, as sales agent (the “Sales Agent”). Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our Class A common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $15.0 million through the Sales Agent. The Sales Agent will receive a commission of 3.0% of the gross sales price per share for any shares sold through it as our sales agent under the Equity Distribution Agreement.

Sales of our Class A common stock, if any, may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be “at-the-market offerings” as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on the NASDAQ Global Market of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange. The Common Stock will be sold pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 as amended (Registration No. 333-212489) declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 2, 2016. The Company filed a prospectus supplement, dated October 3, 2016 to the prospectus, dated August 2, 2016, with SEC in connection with the offer and sale of its Class A common stock.

2017 Strategy 
Our business strategy is centered on two core objectives: reducing debt incurred from the Leucadia financing and accelerating the growth of our core business. 
Reducing Debt Incurred from Leucadia Financing 
We intend to significantly reduce the debt incurred from the Leucadia financing described above through the following means: 
•cash generated through operations;
•sales of the U.S. accounts and other non-core assets; and
•cost savings through staff downsizing and restructuring

Accelerate Growth of Core Business
We intend to accelerate the growth of our core business by:
•increasing focus on retail FX and CFD growth with expanded promotion, distribution and new product introduction;
•offering CFDs on an agency model basis in certain jurisdictions
Our Products and Services
We offer three different account types allowing customers to have the best user experience for their specific trading needs. A majority of our clients open an individual mini account, trading on our proprietary Trading Station platform.
Standard
With an FXCM Standard account, a client has access to 24/7 support and NDD execution. The Standard account offers tighter spreads and a commission pricing similar to stocks. Standard accounts have a $5,000 minimum, require higher margins and offer more trading instruments than the Mini account. 
Mini
With an FXCM Mini account, a client can open an account with a minimum of $50. Mini accounts trade on the dealing desk execution model, offer higher leverage and fewer trading instruments and are designed for clients with smaller account balances. 
Active Trader
With an FXCM Active Trader account, a client receives discounted commissions, preferential solutions, and trading support. This type of account receives access to the highest level of resources and services we offer and requires a minimum balance or trading volume in order to qualify (qualification thresholds may vary by region). 

We offer both FX and CFD products but limit our product offerings to highly liquid instruments like the FX majors, including EUR/USD and USD/JPY, core commodities, including gold and oil, as well as leading equity indices, including the German 30. We believe that by restricting our product offerings we preserve the customer experience by offering a high standard of trade execution and pricing stability through volatile markets (as compared to less liquid instruments) as well as reducing market and counterparty risk for the firm.
Rolling Spot FX Trading
We offer spot FX trading in 45 currency pairs. Of these pairs, our most popular seven currency pairs represent 82.9% of all trading volume, with the EUR/USD currency pair being the most popular, representing 26.7% of our trading volume in 2016. We add new currency pairs provided they meet our risk and regulatory standards. We restrict trading in currencies to instruments that are not subject to active government manipulation.
5

Contracts-for-Difference
We offer our non-U.S. customers the ability to trade CFDs, which are agreements to exchange the difference in value of a particular asset, such as a stock index or oil or gold contract, between the time at which a contract is opened and the time at which it is closed. Our CFD offerings currently include contracts for metals, fixed income, energy and stock indices, and for the year ended December 31, 2016, CFD trading constituted approximately 34.0% of total retail trading volume from continuing operations. We will continue to introduce new products as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. CFD trading is offered through our Trading Station II and Meta Trader 4 (“MT4”) platforms similar to our currency pairs. As most of our FX market makers cannot process agency model trades for CFDs, except for certain metals, these products are not currently offered on an agency basis. 
Spread Betting
We offer FX and CFD spread betting to our U.K. customers, which is where customers take a position against the value of an underlying financial instrument moving either upwards or downwards in the market. Customers can make spread betting trades on FX pairs, stock indices, gold, silver and oil. For the year ended December 31, 2016, spread betting constituted approximately 3.0% of total retail trading volume from continuing operations.
Our Trading Systems
We offer a number of trading systems, all of which are supported by our sophisticated, proprietary technology infrastructure, which includes a price engine to configure and publish executable prices, an execution engine with risk management features and give up and settlement infrastructure, as well as a back office system to book trades, run and display reports to clients. 
Trading Station is our proprietary flagship technology platform. Trading Station is designed to serve the needs of our retail FX customers, but also offers advanced functionalities often used by professional money managers and our institutional customers. Trading Station is a Windows-based platform with a wide variety of customization options for users to choose from, including a choice of 17 languages. The platform provides an advanced chart offering called Marketscope which offers a wide array of customization features, technical analysis indicators, signal and alert functionality, as well as the ability to place trades directly from the chart. We grant many of our white labels a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable, cost-free license to use Trading Station to facilitate trading volume and increase trading fees and commissions.
Meta Trader 4 is a third-party platform built and maintained by MetaQuotes Software Corp, and we have licensed the rights to offer it to our customer base. MT4 caters towards customers with automated trading systems that they have either developed themselves or have purchased from other developers. Our MT4 platform utilizes all the features of our back office system and order execution logic that are provided to users of our proprietary technology platforms. We have integrated MT4 into the same pricing engine as Trading Station, enabling its users to get the same pricing and execution.
FXCM Pro is our institutional department which focuses on brokers who trade with us on an omnibus basis, catering to retail FX and CFD brokers, small hedge funds and emerging market banks. We also offer Prime of Prime services, FXCM Prime, where we provide small and medium sized high frequency trading customers access to prime broker services under our name. FXCM Pro provides retail brokers with tailored pricing and execution, cross collateralization of FX and CFDs in one account, and custom settlement solutions. FXCM Prime provides users centralized clearing across multiple venues, including direct access to single banks, along with pre-trade and post-trade risk monitoring. FXCM Pro adds value by connecting institutional customers to our FX market makers to gain access to preferred pricing. 
Other Platforms
Trading Station Web is similar to Trading Station but is web-based. The browser based platform allows customers to access their account from any computer without installing any additional programs. Trading Station Web is also easy to use and has most of the customization options of Trading Station.
Ninja Trader Platform (“Ninja Trader”) is a third party trading software provider known for its high performance analytic and trade execution tools that maximize a trader’s efficiency in fast-moving markets. Our clients can use the Ninja Trader technology to execute their trades through us. 
6

We also offer mobile platforms for multiple mobile devices, including Android® and the iPhone®/iPad®. These platforms include a majority of the functionality found on the Trading Station and allow customers to log in and trade anywhere in the world.
White Label and Referring Broker Opportunities
We offer financial institutions the ability to offer retail FX trading services to their customers using our technology, our sales and support staff and/or our access to liquidity under their own brand name through white label partnerships, in exchange for a revenue sharing arrangement with us. We also have a wide network of referring brokers, which are third parties that advertise and sell our services in exchange for performance-based compensation. These partnerships allow us to expand into new markets around the world.
We believe we have a well-established presence in Asia and in Europe through our white label partnerships. We have a preferred arrangement with select white labels in strategic regions to whom we have licensed the use of our name as well as our technology. 
Through our white label partners and referring brokers, we generated 37.7% of our retail trading volume from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. We intend to continue to build upon the success of our existing white label partnerships and referring broker networks and create new partnership opportunities around the world.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on diverse customer acquisition channels to expand our customer base.

Direct Marketing Channel
Our direct marketing channel, through which we seek to attract new customers, is our most important marketing channel. In executing our direct marketing strategy, we use a mix of online banner advertising, search engine marketing, email marketing, event marketing, including educational seminars, expos and strategic public and media relations, all of which are aimed at driving prospective customers to FXCM.com domains. In those jurisdictions in which we are not regulated by governmental bodies and/or self-regulatory organizations, however, we are generally restricted from utilizing our direct marketing channel. See “Business - Regulation.”
Our platform is available in 17 languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Russian, Korean, Turkish, Italian, Hebrew, Greek, Portuguese, Polish, Hungarian, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, Arabic) and we have websites available in 15 languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Hebrew, Greek, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified), Indonesian, Japanese, Tagalog, Malay, Vietnamese, Arabic). In the last several years, we have focused on expanding our global footprint by increasing the market share of our local offices in Europe and the Middle East and supporting this expansion with localized marketing campaigns. An international office provides us many benefits, including localized language support, enhanced local credibility via face-to-face client meetings and in-person seminars, local regulations and local deposit options. Currently, we maintain offices in the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Greece and Australia. We also have affiliate offices located in South Africa, Canada and Israel.
The primary objective of our marketing is to encourage prospective customers to register for free practice trading accounts or tradable accounts. Free registered practice trading accounts or “demo” accounts are our principal lead generation tool. We believe the demo account serves as an educational tool, providing prospective customers with the opportunity to try trading in a risk-free environment, without committing any capital. Additionally, it allows prospective customers to evaluate our technology platforms, pricing, tools and services. The demo account is identical to the platform used by our live trading customers, including the availability of live real-time streaming quotes. However, trades are not actually executed with our market makers.
During the trial period for the demo account, we provide customers with information about our firm’s advantages, educational resources and trading tools. To complement these efforts, a team of highly trained and locally licensed sales representatives contact prospective customers by telephone to provide individualized assistance.

Indirect Marketing Channels
Our indirect channels utilize a network of referring brokers and white label partners.
 Referring brokers are third parties that advertise and sell our services in exchange for performance-based compensation. Many referring brokers offer services that are complementary to our brokerage offering, such as trading education and automated trading software. While referring brokers are not permitted to use our name in their advertising, accounts originating from referring brokers are legally opened with an FXCM Group-owned entity. In most cases, the sales function is performed by the referring broker and customer service is provided by our staff.
Our white label channel enables financial institutions to offer retail trading services to their customers using one or more of the following services: (1) our technology; (2) our sales and support staff or (3) our liquidity and execution solutions. FXCM Group-branded white labels can add value to our core offering through increased positive name recognition on a regional or global scale while non-branded white label partners generally provide access to a large existing customer base in markets where we do not have an established brand.
Marketing expertise
We believe that our in-house marketing organization provides us with a competitive advantage. We seldom rely on outside marketing agencies to provide services because our marketing team acts as an in-house agency. Our marketing team handles functions such as creative, media buying, price-per-click advertising, website development, email and database marketing, and corporate communications. Many of these staff members have been with us for multiple years and have developed an internal knowledge base at our company that would probably not otherwise be available. This expertise has enabled us to assemble a tightly integrated digital marketing platform which encompasses our customer relationship management system (salesforce.com), Trading Back Office, Ad Serving, and Website Analytics. As a result, we can calculate the value of any media purchase with a high level of precision on a cost per lead and cost per account basis. We believe this analysis enables us to make intelligent media buying decisions allowing us to maximize our lead and account conversion.
Customer Service
We provide customer service 24 hours a day, seven days a week in English, handling customer inquiries via telephone, email and online chat. To provide efficient service to our growing customer base, we have segmented our customer demographic into three main categories.
New to FX:  We cater to new customers seeking to open accounts by providing low barrier account minimums and in-depth educational resources on the FX market. We believe that education is an important factor for new customers, and we offer online videos for educating new customers on the FX market as well as free technical indicators, trading signals and free live webinars throughout the trading week.
Experienced Customers:  We offer our experienced customers more sophisticated value-added resources and trading functionality. Through our proprietary charting package and integrated high-end third party charts, we offer a comprehensive library of technical indicators, free market data available for back testing strategies as well as platforms and resources to support and assist traders who would like to build and implement automated trading strategies.
High Volume/Algorithmic Trading:  We offer support and specialized products for clients that trade with automated strategies or would like to automate their strategies. From various Application Program Interface options to free and tick data and backtesting functionality, we seek to facilitate algorithmic trading regardless of the level of technical sophistication of the system. Our Active Trader sales group caters to active customers. Active Trader customers can receive price discounts and enhanced service. High volume, automated trading has increased in popularity in the FX market. We have a dedicated programming services team that can code automated trading strategies on behalf of customers. Additionally, we offer multiple automated programming interfaces that allow customers with automated trading systems to connect to our execution system.
Our retail sales and customer service teams are not compensated on a commission basis. All customers receive the same commitment to service from our representatives. We believe this is a key differentiator for us compared to other retail FX firms that employ commission based sales forces who may not be motivated to provide support to smaller customers.

Technology and Infrastructure
Proprietary technology platform
Our FX technology platform has been designed using proprietary technologies to deliver high standards in performance, flexibility and reliability. Our platform can be divided into three main groups: (1) front-end technology platforms and trading decision support tools, (2) agency model technology platform and (3) back office applications for account management, operations, reporting and reconciliation processes.
We believe that our technology and infrastructure platform provides us with a competitive advantage and enables us to provide innovative solutions to our customers and partners. As examples, we introduced the concept of real-time rebate calculation for referring brokers and automation of basic operations and account management routines to reduce processing time.
Reliability and Availability

Our trading infrastructure is primarily hosted at collocation facilities run by Equinix and Xand. The two trading venues are located in New Jersey and Tokyo, with a disaster recovery location in Pennsylvania. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania datacenters are over 90 miles apart, on separate power grids and separate fiber connectivity. Each facility has uninterruptible power supply systems, generator systems, public utility power feeds, cooling systems, internet providers and private network providers. Locations on the eastern coast of the U.S. were chosen to achieve both optimal networking latency to price providers and required geographic distance separation.
Applications, servers, network, storage devices, power and temperature are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by support personnel through a combination of industry standard monitoring and alerting tools, including Nagios, Cacti, SmokePing and NfSen. Custom written applets and scripts are used to report key resource usage in near real-time.
Personnel are distributed across five major office locations with key operations, such as dealing, customer support and technology support, staffed at multiple locations. Each office location utilizes redundant network connections to access datacenter resources.
Security
Data security is of critical importance to us. We use industry standard products and practices throughout our facilities. We have strict policies and procedures with a minimal set of employees retaining access to customer data. Physical security at our datacenters is handled by security staff present 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, we use biometric and card access systems, video surveillance, and “man traps” which refers to a small space having two sets of interlocking doors such that the first set of doors must close before the second set opens and also requires identification for each door. Physical access at our corporate headquarters is also handled by a security staff that is present 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as well as turnstiles and card access systems.
Our systems and policies are tested annually for Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) compliance. Additionally, we engage a public accounting firm to perform an annual examination of our internal controls and issue a SSAE (Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements) 16 Report on Controls at a Service Organization.
Risk Management
We primarily utilize a mix of agency and dealing desk execution models in order to balance our market risk as well as counterparty risk. While the agency model helps us avoid large market exposure brought on by clients with large positions or aggressive trading models, the dealing desk model allows us to minimize exposure to counterparties.
We manage our dealing desk exposure with strict position and loss limits, active monitoring and automation available for quick and seamless transitions of flow to the no dealing desk model should we decide to limit our risk exposure. We also restrict our dealing desk offering to smaller and less active clients as well as to select currency pairs.
Our FX trading operations require a commitment of our capital and involve risk of loss due to the potential failure of our customers to perform their obligations under these transactions. In order to minimize the incidence of a customer’s losses exceeding the amount of cash in their account, which we refer to as negative equity, we require that each trade be collateralized in accordance with our collateral risk management policies. Each customer is required to have minimum funds in their account

for opening positions, referred to as the initial margin, and for maintaining positions, referred to as maintenance margin, depending on the currency pair being traded. Margin requirements are expressed as a percentage of the customer’s total position in that currency, and the customer’s total margin requirement is based on the aggregated margin requirement across all of the positions that a customer holds at any time. Each net position in a particular currency pair is margined separately. Our systems automatically monitor each customer’s margin requirements in real-time and we confirm that each of our customers has sufficient cash collateral in their account before we execute their trades. If at any point in time a customer’s trading position does not comply with the applicable margin requirement because our predetermined liquidation thresholds have been exceeded, the position will be automatically liquidated in accordance with our margin policies and procedures documented in our customer agreement. 
We are also exposed to potential credit risk arising from our exposure to counterparties with which we hedge and financial institutions with whom we deposit cash. By transacting with several of the largest global financial institutions, we have limited our exposure to any one institution. In the event that our access to one or more financial institutions becomes limited, our ability to hedge may be impaired. We actively monitor credit ratings and financial performance of our counterparties and ensure that we are not overly exposed to any individual counterparty or ensure lower exposure to smaller or at risk counterparties.
Relationships with Wholesale FX Market Makers and Prime Brokers
We have entered into a prime brokerage agreement with Citibank (“Citi”) and are currently in discussions with a second prime broker for our retail trading, which we believe will allow us to maximize our credit relationships and activities while improving efficiency. As our prime brokers, these firms operate as central hubs through which we transact with our FX market makers. Our prime brokers allow us to source liquidity from a variety of market makers, even though we maintain a credit relationship, place collateral, and settle with a single entity, the prime broker. We depend on the services of these prime brokers to assist in providing us access to liquidity for FX instruments. In return for paying a modest prime brokerage fee, we are able to aggregate our trading exposures, thereby reducing our transaction costs and increasing the efficiency of the capital we are required to post as collateral. Our prime brokerage agreements may be terminated at any time by either us or the prime broker upon complying with certain notice requirements. We are also obligated to indemnify our prime brokers and certain CFD market makers for certain losses they may incur.
We typically also enter into Master Trading Agreements (such as International Swaps and Derivatives Association or “ISDA” agreements, Futures Master Agreements, or Prime Broker Agreements) with each financial institution that we have a liquidity relationship with. These standardized agreements are widely used in the interbank market for establishing credit relationships and are typically customized to meet the unique needs of each liquidity relationship. These Master Trading Agreements outline the products supported as well as margin requirements for each product. We have had a number of key liquidity relationships in place for over five years and as such we believe we have developed a strong track record of meeting and exceeding the requirements associated with each relationship. However, our FX market makers have no obligation to provide liquidity to us and may terminate our standing arrangements with them at any time, and we currently have a number of effective ISDA agreements and other applicable agreements with other institutions should the need arise. Using the ISDA agreements, an industry standard, we also reduce the legal risk associated with custom legal forms for key relationships.
Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties and rigorously control access to proprietary technology. Currently, we do not have any pending or issued patents.
We have applied or registered for the following material marks with various offices governing intellectual property around the world: FXCMPRO (word mark), FXCM (word mark and design mark), Trading Station (word mark), and StrategyTrader (word mark).
Competition 
The retail FX trading market is fragmented and highly competitive. Our competitors in the retail market can be grouped into several broad categories based on size, business model, product offerings, target customers and geographic scope of operations. Competition in the institutional market can be grouped by type, technology and provider.
10

International multi-product trading firms:  Outside the U.S. we compete with firms such as Saxo Bank, CMC Group and IG Group Holdings plc. Other than Saxo Bank, the international firms tend to focus on CFDs and spread betting.
Other online trading firms:  To a lesser degree, we compete with traditional online equity brokers, such as TradeStation and Interactive Brokers. These firms generally tend to focus on listed products and may already, or will in the future, provide retail FX principally as a complementary offering. 
International banks and other financial institutions with significant FX operations:  We also compete with international banks that have FX operations. Financial institutions generally choose to enter into a joint venture with an independent retail currency firm in lieu of building a retail operation.
We attribute our competitive success to the quality of the service we offer our customers. We believe that our expertise in product innovation, trading technology and international scale will allow us to continue to compete globally as we expand our presence in existing markets and enter new ones.
Regulation
Overview
Our business and industry are highly regulated. Our operating subsidiaries are regulated in a number of jurisdictions, including the U.K. and Australia. Our market sector has been subject to significant regulatory scrutiny in a number of jurisdictions because of the complex and risky nature of the products and the frequently cross-border dimension of the activity that is predominantly internet based.
We are regulated by, among others; the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the U.K. and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission in Australia (“ASIC”). In addition, certain of our branch offices in Europe, while subject to local regulators including Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (Consob); Hellenic Capital Markets Commission (“CMC”) and Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (“Ba fin”), are regulated by the FCA with respect to, among other things, FX, CFDs and net capital requirements. In any foreign jurisdiction in which we operate, there is a possibility that a regulatory authority could assert jurisdiction over our activities and seek to subject us to the laws, rules and regulations of that jurisdiction. The laws, rules and regulations of each foreign jurisdiction differ. In the jurisdictions where we have the most foreign customers, we may be either licensed or registered or believe we are exempt from licensing or registration due to our limited conduct, lack of solicitation in those jurisdictions, and/or other factors. In any jurisdiction where we are relying on an exemption from registration, there remains the risk that we could be required to register, and therefore, be subject to regulation and enforcement action or, in the alternative, to reduce or terminate our activities in these jurisdictions.
In the U.S. Over-the-Counter leveraged FX transactions are governed by the Commodity Exchange Act which gives the Commodities Futures Trading Commission jurisdiction over such transactions entered into with retail investors. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the National Futures Association (“NFA”) regulate the FX and futures markets and protect the interests of customers participating in those markets. In the first quarter of 2017, we withdrew our U.S. license.
Patriot Act/EU Money Laundering Directive
As required by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the Patriot Act, and the EU Money Laundering Directive, we have established comprehensive anti-money laundering and customer identification procedures, designated an anti-money laundering compliance officer, trained our employees and retained an independent audit of our program. There are significant criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violations of the Patriot Act and the EU Money Laundering Directive.
Net Capital Requirements
Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to jurisdictional specific minimum net capital requirements, designed to maintain the general financial integrity and liquidity of a regulated entity. In general, net capital requirements require that at least a minimum specified amount of a regulated entity’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form, usually cash or cash equivalents. Net capital is generally defined as net worth, assets minus liabilities, plus qualifying subordinated borrowings and discretionary liabilities, and less mandatory deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from valuing conservatively other assets.
11

If a firm fails to maintain the minimum required net capital, its regulator and the self-regulatory organization may suspend or revoke its registration and ultimately could require its liquidation. The net capital requirements may prohibit payment of dividends, redemption of stock, prepayment of subordinated indebtedness and issuance of any unsecured advance or loan to a stockholder, employee or affiliate, if the payment would reduce the firm’s net capital below minimum required levels.
In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive I (“MiFID”) organizational requirements on risk management and outsourcing business continuity and record keeping apply to some of our European businesses. The Capital Requirements Directive regulates the relevant prudential requirements including those on capital and liquidity. The capital requirements for different types of investment firms are divided into three different classes: a limited license requires holding capital equal to Euros €50,000; a limited risk license requires holding capital equal to €125,000; and a full license requires holding capital equal to €730,000. Our U.K. entity, which is regulated by the FCA, is a full scope IFPRU Investment Firm required to maintain the greater of €730,000, or the Financial Resources Requirement, which is calculated as the sum of our U.K. entity’s operational, credit, counterparty, concentration, market and forex risk.
Global regulatory bodies continue to evaluate and modify regulatory capital requirements in response to market events in an effort to improve the stability of the international financial system. As of December 31, 2016, on a separate company basis, we were required to maintain approximately $60.6 million of minimum capital in the aggregate across all jurisdictions and approximately $33.3 million of minimum capital in the aggregate for our U.S. entity. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $97.1 million of excess adjusted net capital over this required regulated capital in all jurisdictions, including $14.2 million of excess capital in our U.S. entity. Effective from January 1, 2016, the FCA, which regulates our U.K. entity, introduced the “Capital Conservation Buffer” (CCB) and a “Countercyclical Capital Buffer” (CcyB) in line with the requirements set out in Capital Requirements Directive Article 160 Transitional Provisions for Capital Buffers. This requires all firms to maintain additional buffers on top of the minimum capital requirements noted above, which may vary at the direction of the FCA.
For further information regarding the risks associated with the regulation of our business and industry, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 787 full-time employees and 72 full-time contractors, 488 of which were based in the U.S. None of our domestic employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 
As a result of the restructuring announced in February 2017 and our withdrawal from business in the U.S., we expect to terminate approximately 150 employees globally.
