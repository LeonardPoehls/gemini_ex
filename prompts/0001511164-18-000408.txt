Corporate Overview

Our company was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on July 9, 2004. 

During October 2007 we amended our articles of incorporation to increase the number of our authorized common shares from 75,000,000 to 750,000,000 and to forward stock split our common stock on a 10-for-1 basis. The stock split was based on market conditions and upon a determination by our Board of Directors that the stock split was in our best interests and in the best interests of our shareholders.

Effective March 17, 2014, we conducted a one for four reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, the number of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock decreased from 111,586,705 shares to 27,896,676 shares. Our authorized capital of 750,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 was unchanged.

Effective March 30, 2017, we completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortem Resources Inc., a Nevada corporation, which was incorporated solely to effect a change in our name. As a result, we have changed our name from Strongbow Resources Inc. to Fortem Resources Inc..

Our Current Business

Compeer Oil and Gas Operations

As of February 28, 2018, we have incurred $693,503 in exploration costs to drill, complete and equip the Test Well. We also recorded $28,352 in asset retirement obligations related to the future plugging and abandonment of the Test Well. 

As at June 28, 2018, it is too early to provide stabilized production forecasts.

Future Development Costs for Compeer

During fiscal 2018/19, we plan to focus on the exploration and drilling of the Farmout Lands, identify and complete additional asset acquisition(s), and pursue joint venture agreements with third parties to explore for oil and gas in Canada and the United States. 
Colony Energy

On April 7, 2017, we entered into and closed two Membership Interest Purchase Agreements with three arms length vendors to acquire all the membership interests of 
Colony Energy, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company. Colony Energy holds a 100% interest in and to certain petroleum, natural gas and general rights, including Alberta Crown Petroleum and Oil Leases, in 20 contiguous sections totaling 12,960 acres located in the Godin area of northern Alberta.

The Company intends to develop the Godin Project in three phases beginning with a four well vertical, followed by a four section pad development of 10 wells per pad/per section. Phase 3 is intended to be the full development of 20 sections.

In consideration for the acquisition of Colony, we issued an aggregate of 21,000,000 shares of our common stock to the three vendors on the closing date and agreed to issue an additional 3,000,000 shares on a post-closing basis with 1,000,000 shares to be issued to one of the vendors on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date. As at June 28, 2018, our company and the vendor have agreed to postpone the 2018 share issuance of 1,000,000 shares to a later date.

Colony Energy is a party to a Petroleum, Natural Gas and General Rights Conveyance dated as of March 31, 2017 with an arms length vendor and the principal shareholder thereof, pursuant to which the vendor is entitled to receive certain milestone payments from Colony Energy in the aggregate amount of up to $210,000 as partial consideration for the original purchase of the oil and gas assets described above. Pursuant to a Milestone Payment Addendum dated April 7, 2017, we agreed that if Colony Energy fails to make timely payment of any milestone payment and does not remedy such failure within 30 days after receipt of written notice from the vendor, the vendor may elect to: (i) have Colony Energy re-convey the purchased assets to the vendor; or (ii) receive 250,000 shares of our common stock, with such re-conveyance or issuance of shares to be in full and final satisfaction of all obligations to make any further milestone payment.

Black Dragon 

On April 12 2017, we entered into and closed a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Black Dragon MPA) with two arms length vendors to acquire all membership interest of Black Dragon Energy, LLC (Black Dragon), a Nevada limited liability company. Black Dragon has the right to acquire a 75% working interest in and to certain leases, hydrocarbons, wells, agreements, equipment, surface rights agreements and assignable permits totaling approximately 165,000 acres (258 sections) at an 80% net revenue interest located in the Moenkopi formation of the Carbon and Emery Counties, Utah (Black Dragon Property). 

In consideration for the acquisition of Black Dragon, we issued an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of our common stock to the two vendors on the closing date and paid $100,000 prior to the closing as a non-refundable deposit. 
 
5

Black Dragons sole asset consists of the rights and obligations arising from a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated effective March 1, 2017 (the Black Dragon PSA) between an arms length vendor and Black Dragon. 

On August 17, 2017, we entered into a first amendment to purchase and sale agreement (the Black Dragon Amendment), which amended the terms of the Black Dragon PSA. The Black Dragon Amendment had the effect of postponing certain payments relating to the Moenkopi Formation under the Black Dragon PSA until December 31, 2018 while providing for the flexibility of earlier payments in the discretion of our Company. In consideration for the postponement of such payments, we have agreed to certain additional interim payments and stock consideration as set forth below.

Under the Black Dragon Amendment, we agreed to pay the vendor cash consideration totaling $3.9 million (the Black Dragon Cash Consideration) rather than the original US$2.7 million based upon the following revised payment schedule:

·
 $100,000 as a non-refundable deposit within 5 business days of closing (completed and unchanged); and

·
 the balance of the Black Dragon Cash Consideration by payment to the vendor of an amount equal to 25% of any funds received by our Company from any equity, debt or convertible financing thereof (each, a Financing) upon the closing of each Financing until such amount is paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the first US$1.5 million raised by our Company will be exempt from a 25% payment to the vendor if such amount is received prior to our listing on a stock exchange; and (b) the full Black Dragon Cash Consideration is required to be paid in full no later than December 31, 2018 (later extended to the Black Dragon Payment Deadline as described below) regardless of the amount of funds paid in connection with one or more Financings. This change modified the original requirement to pay $900,000 on or before September 1, 2017, $900,000 on or before March 1, 2018 and $800,000 on or before September 1, 2018.

In addition to revising the Black Dragon Cash Consideration as set out above, we have agreed to: (a) issue 250,000 common shares of the Company to the vendor on or prior to September 1, 2017 (issued on September 1, 2017); and (b) pay the vendor an additional $25,000 every sixty days commencing September 1, 2017 until such time as the Black Dragon Cash Consideration is paid in full.

As an added incentive for early payment of the Black Dragon Cash Consideration, such sum will be reduced by $100,000 for each calendar month it is paid in full prior to December 31, 2018 for a maximum discount of 12 months or $1.2 million.

In connection with the Black Dragon Amendment, we entered into a Ratification of Purchase and Sale Agreement with the vendor on August 17, 2017 but effective March 1, 2017, whereby we ratified, adopted and approved the Black Dragon Amendment and further guaranteed all the obligations of our company.

On May 28, 2018, we entered into a second amendment to purchase and sale agreement (the Second Black Dragon Amendment), which amended the terms of the Black Dragon PSA. The Second Black Dragon Amendment has the effect of postponing certain payments relating to the Moenkopi formation under the Black Dragon PSA until August 1, 2019, provided that, if the shares of common stock of our company are not listed on the TSX Venture Exchange on or before August 1, 2018, the payment deadline will remain December 31, 2018 (the Black Dragon Payment Deadline).

In connection with the Second Black Dragon Amendment, we entered into a Ratification of Purchase and Sale Agreement with the vendor on May 28, 2018 but effective March 1, 2017, whereby we ratified, adopted and approved the Second Black Dragon Amendment and further guaranteed all the obligations of our company.

Carry Obligation

Under the Black Dragon PSA, and in addition to the cash consideration, Black Dragon has agreed to pay all costs and expenses incurred on the assets with respect to any and all exploration, development and production during the carry period. The Carry Period continues until the later of either (i) the date that Black Dragon pays the full cash consideration set out above or (ii) the date that Black Dragon pays all costs and expenses for the drilling, logging, testing and completion two new wells, each well with a horizontal leg extending at least 2,000 in the target zone within the Moenkopi formation (the Two Obligation Wells). Black Dragon is required to drill to completion or cause to be drilled to completion (or plugging and abandonment) the Two Obligation Wells on or before February 28, 2019, failing which, Black Dragons right to earn any assignment in and to the assets will terminate immediately. For each vertical well drilled to 200 feet below the top of the Kaibab formation through completion (or plugging or abandonment) within a Federal Unit, the obligation deadline will be amended to the later of (i) the current obligation deadline or (ii) 6 months from the date the rig that drilled such vertical well to total depth has been removed from the wellsite.

Within 10 business days after the later of Black Dragon paying the cash consideration in full or Black Dragon meeting in full its carry obligation, the vendor will convey to Black Dragon an undivided 75% of the Vendors right, title and interest in and to the assets, at an 80% Net Revenue Interest in the assets as further described in the Black Dragon PSA.

On August 24, 2017, our company indirectly acquired a 75% interest in additional oil and gas leases in the Moenkopi formation covering a total of 3,852.41 acres. The leases were also acquired at the SITLA auction (the State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration) and are in the region covered by an Area of Mutual Interest defined under the Black Dragon PSA, which incorporates a form of joint operating agreement that will govern the joint ownership of the newly acquired leases.

Rolling Rock

On April 17, 2017, we entered into and closed a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with two arms length vendors to acquire 100% membership interest of Rolling Rock Resources, LLC (Rolling Rock), a Nevada limited liability company. Rolling Rock has the right to acquire a 50% working interest in and to certain leases, hydrocarbons, wells, agreements, equipment, surface rights agreements and assignable permits totaling approximately 101,888 acres (160 sections) at an 80% net revenue interest located in the Mancos formation in the Southern Uinta Basin, Utah (Rolling Rock Property).

In consideration for the acquisition of Rolling Rock, we issued an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of our common stock to the two vendors on the closing date and paid $100,000 prior to the closing as a non-refundable deposit. 

Rolling Rocks sole asset consists of the rights and obligations arising from a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated effective March 1, 2017, as amended (together, the Rolling Rock PSA), between an arms length vendor and Rolling Rock. Upon the satisfaction of the payments and obligations by Rolling Rock as set out below, the vendor has agreed to convey certain leases and related assets (the Leases) to Rolling Rock. The Leases include certain leases, hydrocarbons, wells, agreements, equipment, surface rights agreements and assignable permits all as further set out in the Rolling Rock PSA. 

On August 17, 2017, we entered into a second amendment to purchase and sale agreement (the Rolling Rock Amendment), which amended the terms of the Rolling Rock PSA. 

The Rolling Rock Amendment had the effect of postponing certain payments relating to the Mancos formation under the Rolling Rock PSA until December 31, 2018 while providing for the flexibility of earlier payments in the discretion of our Company. In consideration for the postponement of such payments, Rolling Rock agreed to certain additional interim payments and stock consideration as set forth below.
 
7

Under the Rolling Rock Amendment, Rolling Rock has agreed to pay the vendor cash consideration totaling $3.6 million (the Rolling Rock Cash Consideration) rather than the original $2.4 million based upon the following revised payment schedule:

·
 $100,000 as a non-refundable deposit within 5 business days of closing (completed and unchanged);

·
 the balance of the Rolling Rock Cash Consideration by payment to the vendor of an amount equal to 25% of any funds received by our Company from any Financing upon the closing of each Financing until such amount is paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the first $1.5 million raised by our Company will be exempt from a 25% payment to the vendor if such amount is received prior to our listing on a stock exchange; and (b) the full Rolling Rock Cash Consideration is required to be paid in full no later than December 31, 2018 (later extended to the Rolling Rock Payment Deadline as described below) regardless of the amount of funds paid in connection with one or more Financings. This change modified the original requirement to pay $1.3 million on or before September 1, 2017, $500,000 on or before March 1, 2018 and $500,000 on or before September 1, 2018; and

·
 after payment of the Rolling Rock Cash Consideration, an additional payment of $300,000 (the Workover Funds) to the vendor which is payable by an amount equal to 25% of any funds received by our company from any Financing until the Workover Funds are paid in full.

In addition to revising the Rolling Rock Cash Consideration as set out above, we have agreed to: (a) issue 250,000 common shares of the Company to the vendor on or prior to September 1, 2017 (issued on September 1, 2017); and (b) pay the vendor an additional $25,000 every sixty days commencing September 1, 2017 until such time as the Rolling Rock Cash Consideration and the Workover Funds are paid in full.

As an added incentive for early payment of the Rolling Rock Cash Consideration, such sum will be reduced by $100,000 for each calendar month it is paid in full prior to December 31, 2018 for a maximum discount of 12 months or $1.2 million.

In connection with the Rolling Rock Amendment, we entered into a Ratification of Purchase and Sale Agreement with the vendor on August 17, 2017 but effective March 1, 2017, whereby we ratified, adopted and approved the Rolling Rock Amendment and further guaranteed all the obligations of our company.

On May 28, 2018, we entered into a third amendment to purchase and sale agreement (the Third Rolling Rock Amendment), which amended the terms of the Rolling Rock PSA. The Third Rolling Rock Amendment has the effect of postponing certain payments relating to the Mancos formation under the Rolling Rock PSA until August 1, 2019, provided that, if the shares of common stock of our company are not listed on the TSX Venture Exchange on or before August 1, 2018, the payment deadline will remain December 31, 2018 (the Rolling Rock Payment Deadline).

In connection with the Third Rolling Rock Amendment, we entered into a Ratification of Purchase and Sale Agreement with the vendor on May 28, 2018 but effective March 1, 2017, whereby we ratified, adopted and approved the Third Rolling Rock Amendment and further guaranteed all the obligations of our company.

Carry Obligation

Under the Rolling Rock PSA, and in addition to the cash consideration, Rolling Rock has agreed to pay all costs and expenses incurred on the Leases with respect to any and all exploration, development and production during the carry period. The Carry Period continues until the later of either (i) the date that Rolling Rock pays the full cash consideration set out above or (ii) the date that Rolling Rock pays all costs and expenses for the drilling, logging, testing and completion of three new wells in each of the three Federal Units, each well with a horizontal leg extending at least 1,000 in the target zone within the Mancos formation (the Three Obligation Wells). Rolling Rock is required to drill to completion or cause to be drilled to completion (or plugging and abandonment) the Three Obligation Wells on or before February 28, 2019, failing which, Rolling Rocks right to earn any assignment in and to the Leases will terminate immediately. For each vertical well drilled to the top of the Dakota formation through completion (or plugging or abandonment) within a Federal Unit, the obligation deadline will be amended to the later of (i) the current obligation deadline or (ii) 6 months from the date the rig that drilled such vertical well to total depth has been removed from the wellsite.

The obligation well in the Grand Mancos Unit will be a vertical well drilled to a depth sufficient to test the Granite Walsh formation within such Federal Unit. For this well, completion (or plugging and abandonment) is expected to take place no later than 2 months after the rig that drilled to total depth has been removed from the wellsite and for a period of 6 months after completion of this obligation well (or plugging and abandonment), and Rolling Rock will have the exclusive option to purchase an additional 25% of the vendors right, title and interest in and to the leases with respect to the Granite Walsh formation within the boundary of the Grand Mancos Unit for an additional payment of $10 million. 

Within 10 business days after the later of Rolling Rock paying the cash consideration in full or Rolling Rock meeting in full its carry obligation, the vendor agreed to convey to Rolling Rock an undivided 50% of the vendors right, title and interest in and to the Leases, or a 80% net revenue interest in the Leases as further described in the Rolling Rock PSA. Notwithstanding this transfer, within 10 business days after the later of payment of $300,000 on or before September 1, 2017 (which amount is in addition to the deposit and included in the cash consideration set out above) and the replacement of the vendors bonds on or before September 1, 2017, the vendor agreed to convey to Rolling Rock an undivided 50% of the vendors right, title and interest in and to the Cisco Dome leases and related assets as further set out in the Rolling Rock PSA. However, if Rolling Rock fails to timely meet any of its obligations under the Rolling Rock PSA, after having taken assignment of the Cisco Dome leases and assets, then, if the vendor elects in its sole discretion, Rolling Rock is required to reassign the Cisco Dome leases and assets to the vendor without any additional encumbrances.

On August 24, 2017, our company indirectly acquired an undivided 75% interest in additional oil and gas leases in the Mancos formation covering a total of 2,313.09 acres. The leases were acquired at a SITLA auction. Pursuant to the Rolling Rock PSA, the parties have agreed to enter into a joint operating agreement covering the new leases, which are outside the AMI (Area of Mutual Interest) of their original joint venture lease holdings.
 Based on a separate transaction, our company and the vendor have acquired an additional 5,174 acres in the Mancos formation and hold a 50/50 partnership, which is part of the AMI and its original agreement. 

City of Gold

On May 17, 2017, we acquired 100% of the membership interest in City of Gold, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, from two Nevada limited liability companies pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement dated as of May 17, 2017. The Membership Interest Purchase Agreement provides for a total purchase price consisting of an aggregate of 30,000,000 common shares in the capital of our company. 15,000,000 of these shares were issued at closing (7,500,000 to each transferor); the other 15,000,000 shares are to be issued within ten Business Days after City of Gold, LLC earns the Option (as defined below). 

City of Gold, LLCs sole asset consists of 2,930,259 common shares and 2,930,259 share purchase warrants in the capital of Asia Pacific Mining Limited (Asia Pacific) and its rights under a binding financing and option agreement (the Option Agreement) with Asia Pacific and an individual named Nyi Nyi Lwin. City of Gold, LLCs only liabilities consist of three demand notes for an aggregate of $1,500,000.
 
9

Under the Option Agreement, Asia Pacific and Nyi Nyi Lwin have agreed to grant to City of Gold, LLC the option (the Option) to purchase 100% of the ownership interest in a wholly-owned subsidiary of Asia Pacific (the Project Subsidiary) which, in turn, owns 100% of the rights to the City of Gold mineral exploration project located in Myanmar which covers an area of approximately 465 square kilometers in close proximity to hydropower, water, and infrastructure to accommodate exploration and development of the property (the City of Gold Project). City of Gold, LLC will be granted the Option upon satisfaction of the following:
 ·
 Subscription of 976,753 units of Asia Pacific for a purchase price of $500,000 on or prior to March 2, 2017 (completed);
 ·
 Subscription of 976,753 units of Asia Pacific for a purchase price of $500,000 on or prior to March 16, 2017 (completed);
 ·
 Subscription of 976,753 units of Asia Pacific for a purchase price of $500,000 on or prior to April 28, 2017 (completed); and
 ·
 Subscription of 2,930,261 units of Asia Pacific for a purchase price of $1,500,000 (the Final Funding Tranche), due within 60 days of issuance of an exploration license for the City of Gold Project by the Government of Myanmar (the License). 

Each share purchase warrant is exercisable for a term equal to the greater of two years from the closing of the Final Funding Tranche or 18 months from the issuance of the License at an exercise price of $0.51 for the first year and $1.02 for the second year. Asia Pacific utilized $500,000 of the initial three tranches towards an exploration program of the City of Gold Project. Asia Pacific is required to use all proceeds for the Final Funding Tranche towards exploration of the Project Subsidiarys mining interests, including no less than $500,000 towards drilling the City of Gold Project (the Drilling Program). Upon the closing of the Final Funding Tranche, City of Gold, LLC will have earned the Option. 
We anticipate that the normal course of receiving the License will take longer than 12 months. As a result, we do not anticipate commencing the Drilling Program or incurring additional expenses related to the project within the next 12 month period. We anticipate holding our interest in the City of Gold Project for the long term. If circumstances warrant, we intend to exercise the Option by transferring the City of Gold Project into a subsidiary (Spinco) with the aim of completing a spin-off transaction of its anticipated 70% interest in Spinco under the plan of arrangement provisions in accordance with applicable securities and corporate laws in order to realize a benefit for our company and/or our stockholders.

Once City of Gold, LLC has earned the Option, it will have the right to exercise the Option for a period of 120 days from completion of the Drilling Program, which City of Gold, LLC can extend for an additional 120 days if it can demonstrate that all conditions to exercise of the Option are complete other than approval from the applicable stock exchange upon which the shares of Spinco are to be listed. To exercise the Option, Asia Pacific has agreed to transfer the Project Subsidiary to Spinco for an exercise price consisting of $7,000,000 in cash and 30% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Spinco (calculated on a fully diluted basis, excluding up to 10% in stock options, but including shares Spinco may have issued in order to raise the exercise price of $7,000,000 and an additional $5,000,000 in working capital). Half of the cash portion of the exercise price must be paid upon exercise of the Option; the balance is to be paid on the first anniversary of the exercise and is to be evidenced by a one-year secured term note. Although City of Gold, LLC has the right to select Spinco, Spinco must meet the following criteria: at exercise of the Option, Spinco must have less than $100,000 in liabilities and $5,000,000 or more in working capital and Asia Pacific will have the right to nominate 30% of its directors. Although we currently anticipate that the exercise of the Option will be structured as a spin-off transaction, we have the flexibility under the Option Agreement to structure the transaction in other ways provided the conditions to exercise are met. However, we anticipate that such a structure will result in the most efficient way to monetize our interest in the City of Gold Project at this time.

Competition

The petroleum and natural gas industry is highly competitive. Numerous independent oil and gas companies, oil and gas syndicates and major oil and gas companies actively seek out and bid for oil and gas properties as well as for the services of third party providers, such as drilling companies, upon which we rely. A substantial number of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial and personnel resources than we do, and have demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles.
 
10

Some of our competitors not only explore for, produce and market petroleum and natural gas, but also carry out refining operations and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis which may provide them with additional sources of capital. Larger and better capitalized competitors may be in a position to outbid us for particular prospect rights. These competitors may also be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling. Larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.

Petroleum and natural gas producers also compete with other suppliers of energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual customers. Competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments and/or their agencies and other factors which are out of our control including, international political conditions, terrorism, overall levels of supply and demand for oil and gas, and the markets for synthetic fuels and alternative energy sources.

To better deal with the competition, we target high potential exploration properties which are too small for our largest competitors. We rely upon the technical experience of our officers and engineers to select those properties on which our exploration expertise provides a differentiating advantage.

Customers

There are no contracts obligating our company to provide a fixed quantity of oil and gas to any party. 

Regulation 

The exploration, production and sale of oil and gas are extensively regulated by governmental authorities. Applicable legislation is under constant review for amendment or expansion. These efforts frequently result in an increase in the regulatory burden on companies in our industry and consequently an increase in the cost of doing business and decrease in profitability. Numerous governmental departments and agencies are authorized to, and have, issued rules and regulations imposing additional burdens on the oil and gas industry that often are costly to comply with and carry substantial penalties for non-compliance. Production operations are affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the petroleum industry, constantly changing administrative regulations and possible interruptions or termination by government authorities.

Oil and gas mineral rights may be held by individuals, corporations or governments having jurisdiction over the area in which such mineral rights are located. As a general rule, parties holding such mineral rights grant licenses or leases to third parties to facilitate the exploration and development of these mineral rights. The terms of the leases and licenses are generally established to require timely development. Notwithstanding the ownership of mineral rights, the government of the jurisdiction in which mineral rights are located generally retains authority over the drilling and operation of oil and gas wells.

Each province and the federal government of Canada have legislation and regulations governing land tenure, royalties, production rates and taxes, environmental protection and other matters under their respective jurisdictions. The royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production. Royalties payable on production from lands other than Crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties. Crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices, well productivity, geographical location, field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced. From time to time, the governments of Canada and Alberta have established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions, royalty holidays, tax credits and drilling royalty credits. These incentives are for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects. These incentives generally increase cash flow.

Effective January 1, 2009, oil sands royalties in Alberta are calculated using a sliding scale for royalty rates ranging from 1% to 9% pre-payout and 25% to 40% post-payout depending on the world oil price. Project payout refers to the point in which we earn sufficient revenues to recover all of the allowed costs for the project plus a return allowance. The base royalty starts at 1% and increases for every dollar the world oil price, as reflected by the WTI, is priced above $55 per barrel, to a maximum of 9% when oil is priced at $120 per barrel or greater. The net royalty starts at 25% and increases for every dollar oil is priced above $55 per barrel to 40% when oil is priced at $120 or higher.

The exploration and development of oil and gas properties is subject to various United States federal, state and local governmental regulations. Our company may, from time to time, be required to obtain licenses and permits from various governmental authorities in regards to the exploration of our property interests. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling and abandonment bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas. 

Environmental Considerations

The oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental laws and regulations pursuant to United States and Canadian local, state, provincial and federal legislation. Environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations. In addition, legislation requires that well and facility sites be monitored, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities. A breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties. Under these laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injury, clean-up costs and other environmental and property damages as well as administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Accordingly, we could be liable or could be required to cease production on properties if environmental damage occurs. Although we maintain insurance coverage, the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations in the future may harm our business. Furthermore, future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur that result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and increased capital expenditures and operating costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We maintain commercial property and general liability insurance coverage on the properties we operate. We also maintain operators extra expense insurance which provides coverage for well control incidents specifically relating to regaining control of a well, seepage, pollution, clean-up and containment. No coverage is maintained with respect to any fine or penalty required to be paid due to a violation of the regulations set out by the federal and provincial regulatory authorities. We are committed to meeting our responsibilities to protect the environment and anticipate making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment.

Albertas new climate change regulation, effective July 1, 2007, requires Alberta facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year to reduce emissions intensity by 12 per cent. Companies have four choices to meet their reductions: (1) they can make operating improvements to their operations that will result in greenhouse gas emission reductions; (2) purchase Alberta based offset credits; (3) contribute to the Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund; and (4) purchase or use emission performance credits, also called EPCs, these credits are generated by facilities that have gone beyond the 12% mandatory intensity reduction. EPCs can be banked for future use or sold to other facilities that need to meet the reduction target. 

On June 18, 2009, the Canadian government passed the new Environmental Enforcement Act (EEA). The EEA was created to strengthen and amend nine existing Statutes that relate to the environment and to enact provisions respecting the enforcement of certain Statutes that relate to the environment. The EEA amends various enforcement, offence, penalty and sentencing provisions to deter offenders from committing offences under the EEA by setting minimum and maximum fines for serious offences. The EEA also gives enforcement officers new powers to investigate cases and grants courts new sentencing authorities that ensure penalties reflect the seriousness of the pollution and wildlife offences. The EEA also expands the authority to deal with environmental offenders by: (1) specifying aggravating factors such as causing damage to wildlife or wildlife habitat, or causing damage that is extensive, persistent or irreparable; (2) providing fine ranges that are higher for corporate offenders than for individuals; (3) doubling fine ranges for repeat offenders; (4) authorizing the suspension and cancellation of licenses, permits or other authorizations upon conviction; (5) requiring corporate offenders to report convictions to shareholders; and (6) mandating the reporting of corporate offences on a public registry.

The production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of oil and gas, by-products thereof, and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations are also subject to regulation under United States federal, state and local laws and regulations relating primarily to the protection of human health and the environment. Additionally, we may incur expenditures related to compliance with such laws, and may incur costs in connection with the remediation of any environmental contamination. The requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations.
