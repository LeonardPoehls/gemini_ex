Item 1.  Business
Background
The General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of bulk distribution ("industrial") real estate. 
The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT, which began operations upon completion of an initial public offering in February 1986. 
The Partnership was formed in October 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds from an offering of additional shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning 99.1% of the Common Units at December 31, 2017. The remaining 0.9% of the Common Units are owned by limited partners. Limited partners have the right to redeem their Limited Partner Units, subject to certain restrictions. Pursuant to the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (the "Partnership Agreement"), the General Partner is obligated to redeem the Limited Partner Units in shares of its common stock, unless it determines in its reasonable discretion that the issuance of shares of its common stock could cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT. Each Limited Partner Unit shall be redeemed for one share of the General Partner's common stock, or, in the event that the issuance of shares could cause the General Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT, cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the General Partner's common stock at the time of redemption, in each case, subject to certain adjustments described in the Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partner Units are not required, per the terms of the Partnership Agreement, to be redeemed in registered shares of the General Partner. 
At December 31, 2017, our diversified portfolio of 509 rental properties (including 42 jointly controlled in-service properties with 11.2 million square feet, 12 consolidated properties under development with 7.2 million square feet and four jointly controlled properties under development with 2.0 million square feet) encompassed 148.8 million rentable square feet. Our properties are leased by a diverse base of more than 1,000 tenants whose businesses include e-commerce, government services, manufacturing, retailing, wholesale trade, and distribution. We also owned, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), 1,900 acres of land and controlled an additional 1,600 acres through purchase options.
Our headquarters and executive offices are located in Indianapolis, Indiana. We additionally have regional offices or significant operations in 20 other geographic or metropolitan areas including Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Central Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; New Jersey; Northern and Southern California; Pennsylvania; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Seattle, Washington; South Florida; St. Louis, Missouri; and Washington D.C. We had approximately 400 employees at December 31, 2017.
See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information related to our operational, asset and capital strategies.
Reportable Operating Segments
We have two reportable operating segments at December 31, 2017, the first consisting of the ownership and rental of industrial real estate investments. The operations of our industrial properties, as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations (our residual non-industrial properties that have not yet been sold, referred to throughout as "Non-Reportable"), are collectively referred to as "Rental Operations." Our second reportable segment consists of various real estate services such as property management, asset management, maintenance, leasing, development, general contracting and construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, and is collectively

referred to as "Service Operations." Our reportable segments are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise. Our Service Operations segment also includes our taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), a legal entity through which certain of the segment's aforementioned operations are conducted. See Item 6, "Selected Financial Data," Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for financial information related to our reportable segments.
Competitive Conditions
As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house leasing, management, development and construction services which we believe, coupled with our significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing business parks, should give us a competitive advantage as a real estate operator and in future development activities.
We believe that the management of real estate opportunities and risks can be done most effectively at regional or on local levels. As a result, we intend to continue our emphasis on increasing our market share, to the extent it is in markets or product types that align with our asset strategy (see Item 7), and effective rents in the primary markets where we own properties. We believe that this regional focus will allow us to assess market supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on the strong relationships with our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on our many strong relationships with customers that operate on a national level. As a fully integrated real estate company, we are able to arrange for or provide to our tenants not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and expansion flexibility.
All of our properties are located in areas that include competitive properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply of and demand for similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive on our properties. Other competitive factors include the attractiveness of the property location, the quality of the property and tenant services provided, and the reputation of the owner and operator. 
Corporate Governance
Since our inception, we not only have strived to be a top-performer operationally, but also to lead in issues important to investors such as disclosure and corporate governance. The General Partner's system of governance reinforces this commitment and, as a limited partnership that has one general partner owning over 90% of the Partnership's common interest, the governance of the Partnership is necessarily linked to the corporate governance of the General Partner. Summarized below are the highlights of the General Partner's Corporate Governance initiatives.

Recent U.S. Federal Income Tax Legislation
On December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act"), which includes a number of provisions related to REITs and real estate investments. These changes are briefly summarized as follows:

• | Effective January 1, 2018, the federal corporate income tax rate will be permanently reduced to 21%.

-6-


• | Effective January 1, 2018, individuals are entitled to a 20% deduction for certain business-related income from pass-through entities, such as partnerships and limited liability companies and for ordinary REIT dividends. The 2017 Tax Act also adjusts the income tax brackets for individuals. The top federal income tax rate is reduced to 37%, and various deductions are eliminated or limited. The combination of a top rate of 37% and a 20% deduction for ordinary REIT dividends reduces the top federal income tax rate on ordinary REIT dividends to 29.6%. Most of the changes applicable to individuals are temporary and apply only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. 


• | For taxable years beginning after 2017, Section 1031 like kind exchanges will be ended for all assets other than real estate.


• | For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the deductibility of business interest expense is generally limited to 30% of a taxpayer's adjusted taxable income, which is taxable business income, excluding business interest income and expense, net operating losses ("NOLs"), the 20% deduction for certain business income and, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, depreciation and amortization. This limitation does not apply to an "electing real property trade or business." Taxpayers that elect out of the interest expense limitations must apply less favorable depreciation rules for real property.


• | NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may offset only 80% of taxable income. Any NOLs generated in tax years ending after 2017 will no longer be eligible for carryback but will be eligible for indefinite carryforward.
