ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Yosen Group, Inc. (formerly known as “China 3C Group”) (including our subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise, the “Company”, “Yosen,”“Yosen Group,”“we,” or “us”) was incorporated on August 20, 1998 under the laws of the State of Nevada.
 
In 2007 we began operating under “store in store” business model. The “store in store” business model resulted in expanded marketing channels, thus, stimulated the growth of sales in 2007 and 2008. We were only engaged in the resale and distribution of third party products and generated 100% of our revenue from resale of items such as mobile phones, facsimile machines, DVD players, stereos, speakers, MP3 and MP4 players, iPods, electronic dictionaries, CD players and audio systems. We operate “stores in stores” under the brand names Hangzhou Wang Da, Yiwu YongXin and Zhejiang Yongxin. However, starting in 2009, we had declining sales under the model due to increased competition from direct stores and large department stores and the impact of the economic slowdown. As a result, Yiwu YongXin ceased operation in 2012 and Wang Da ceased operation in 2013. Zhejiang is the only entity operating under the “store in store” business model.
 
Under the stores in stores model, we distribute our products mainly via the so-called concessionaire agreements with larger department stores, supermarkets, large electronics retail stores, and other retailers. Under this model, companies like Yosen own their own outlets within larger stores and in so doing assume responsibility for most financial and operational aspects of those outlets including capital cost, inventory, wages, product selections, pricing, and general management. Our retail partners are compensated via margin they earn on the products we sell. This model is similar to that employed by many department stores in the US. However, it is different from the model found at large electronics retailers like Best Buy and general retailers like Wal-Mart. We found that many investors are curious as to why the model in China differs from that in the US. We believe the main reasons are:
 
•          We decrease the financial risk for our retail partners by assuming responsibility for the inventory and capital expense associated with distributing our products.
 
•          We decrease operational risk for our retail partners by hiring and managing employees and handling logistics issues such as wholesale purchase and delivery and returns and after-sales service.
 
•          We decrease merchandising risk for our retail partners by bringing product expertise and specific market knowledge that is difficult for large retailers to develop on their own across a broad range of product categories.
 
•          China’s size, regional differences, logistical difficulties, managerial challenges, underdeveloped credit markets, and rapid growth rate increases risk for all retailers and drive the need to mitigate risk which is why our retail partners rely on us.
 
On December 21, 2012, we received confirmation from the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada that the Certificate of Change Pursuant to NRS 78.209 (the “Certificate of Change”) to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to effect a reverse split of our common stock, $0.001, par value per share (the “Common Stock”), at a ratio of 1-for-5 with all fractional shares rounded up to the next whole share (the “Reverse Stock Split”) was filed on December 21, 2012. Immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split, we had 93,911,327 shares of Common Stock outstanding. After the Reverse Stock Split, we had 18,782,356 shares outstanding. Pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split, the number of authorized shares of our Common Stock was reduced from 100,000,000 to 20,000,000 shares of Common Stock. Each shareholder's percentage ownership interest in the Company and proportional voting power remained unchanged after the Reverse Stock Split except for minor changes and adjustments resulting from rounding up the fractional shares.
 
Immediately, following the consummation of the Reverse Stock Split, on December 21, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation pursuant to NRS 78.385 and 78.390 (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to increase our number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 20,000,000 to 50,000,000 shares (the “Capital Increase Amendment”) and to approve the amendment of our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to “Yosen Group, Inc.” (the “Name Change Amendment)”. The Reverse Stock Split, Capital Increase Amendment and the Name Change Amendment were approved by the board of directors (“BOD” or “Board”) of the Company on October 10, 2012. In addition, the actions taken by the BOD with respect to the Capital Increase Amendment and the Name Change Amendment were subsequently adopted by the written consent dated as of October 10, 2012 of our stockholders entitled to vote a majority of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding. The Reverse Stock Split was also ratified by these stockholders.
 
Following the filing of the Name Change Amendment, we changed our stock symbol to "YOSN" effective as of the opening of trading on January 30, 2013 on the OTCBB.
 
On January 6, 2015 the Company established a US based wholly-owned subsidiary, Yosen Trading Inc., a New York corporation (“Yosen Trading”), for the purpose of engaging primarily in international trade and wholesale business, initially with tile, kitchen cabinet, granite and marble products. Yosen Trading ceased operation in 2015.

As a result of the investment, the Company owns 64.8% of Zhejiang Lamapai as of December 31, 2016.

On August 26, 2016, we received confirmation from the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada that the Certificate of Change Pursuant to NRS 78.209 (the “Certificate of Change”) to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to effect a reverse split of our common stock, $0.001, par value per share (the “Common Stock”), at a ratio of 1-for-3 with all fractional shares rounded up to the next whole share (the “Reverse Stock Split”) was duly filed. Immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split, we had 29,292,527 shares of Common Stock outstanding. After the Reverse Stock Split, we had 9,764,176 shares outstanding. Each shareholder's percentage ownership interest in the Company and proportional voting power remained unchanged after the Reverse Stock Split except for minor changes and adjustments resulting from rounding up the fractional shares.
 
Organizational Structure
 
Yosen Group, Inc. (the “Company” or “Yosen”) was incorporated on August 20, 1998 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Capital Future Developments Limited (“Capital”) was incorporated on July 22, 2004 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Zhejiang YongXin Digital Technology Company Limited (“Zhejiang”), Yiwu YongXin Communication Limited (“Yiwu”), Hangzhou Wang Da Electronics Company Limited (“Wang Da”) were incorporated under the laws of the Peoples Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”) on July 11, 2005, July 18, 1997, March 30, 1998, respectively. Zhejiang set up a new operating entity, Hangzhou Letong Digital Technology Co., Ltd. (“Letong”) on March 10, 2009. On January 6, 2014 the Company established Yosen Trading Inc. (“Yosen Trading”), its wholly owned US based subsidiary in New York. On April 23, 2015, the Company established a wholly owned subsidiary Hangzhou Yongxin Lamapai E-commerce Co., Ltd (“Hangzhou Lamapai”). On September 24, 2015, Hangzhou Lamapai established a new company Zhejiang Yongxin Lamapai E-commerce Co., Ltd (“Zhejiang Lamapai”). In 2016, Zhejiang Lamapai established Ningbo Yongxin Lamapai E-commerce Co. Ltd ("Ningbo") and Hangzhou Saizhuo brand management Co., Ltd ("Saizhuo"). Hangzhou Lamaipai, Zhejiang Lamapai, Saizhuo and Ningbo are collectively referred as Lamapai entities ("Lamapai entities"). The Company invested RMB 6,193,541 to Zhejiang Lamapai. As a result of the investment, the Company owns 64.8% of Zhejiang Lamapai as of December 31, 2016.

On December 21, 2005, Capital became a wholly owned subsidiary of Yosen through a reverse merger (“Merger Transaction”). Yosen acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Capital pursuant to a Merger Agreement dated December 21, 2005 by and among Yosen, XY Acquisition Corporation, Capital and the shareholders of Capital (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Capital became a wholly owned subsidiary of Yosen and, in exchange for the Capital shares, Yosen issued 7,000,000 shares of its common stock to the shareholders of Capital, representing 93% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Yosen at that time and cash of $500,000.
 
On August 15, 2007, we executed a series of contractual agreements between Capital and Zhejiang. The contractual agreements give Capital and its equity owners an obligation, and having ability to absorb, any losses, and rights to receive returns; however, these contractual agreements did not change the equity ownership of Zhejiang. We did not dispose Capital’s actual equity ownership of Zhejiang when we execute the contractual agreements. Capital entered into share-holding entrustment agreements with five individuals - Zhenggang Wang, Yimin Zhang, Huiyi Lv, Xiaochun Wang and Zhongsheng Bao to hold 35%, 20%, 20%, 15% and 10%, respectively, of the equity interest of Zhejiang on behalf of Capital on November 21, 2005. The entrustment agreements confirm that Capital is the actual owner of Zhejiang. Capital enjoys the actual shareholder’s rights and has the right to obtain any benefits received by the nominal holders. Zhenggang Wang is the CEO and shareholder of Yosen. Yimin Zhang, Huiyi Lv, Xiaochun Wang and Zhongsheng Bao have no other relationship with Yosen. No consideration was given to these individuals who held the equity of Zhejiang on behalf of Capital.
 
Letong ceased operations in 2011. Yiwu closed all its stores in stores locations in 2012. Wang Da closed all its stores in the second quarter 2014. Yosen Trading ceased operation in 2015.
 
As a result, we have only two operating Chinese subsidiaries, Zhejiang and Lamapai entities. Zhejiang focuses on distributing Samsung and Apple brand products. Zhejiang sells products mostly through retail stores, with a small percentage sold directly to distributors on a wholesale basis. We operate most of our retail operations through our “store in store” model. Under this model, the Company leases space in major department stores and retailers. Leasing costs can vary based on the percentage of sales, or can be fixed. In 2016 and 2015, all of our stores in stores leases were variable based on sales. Lamapai entities operate as a cross-border online to offline (“O2O”) platform. Lamapai entities distribute a variety of imported products including but not limited to Digital products, baby products, health nutrition and frozen food. Lamapai entities sell the products through its online store, applications on mobile devices and also in physical stores.

The five largest customers contributed 90.6% of revenues of Zhejiang in 2016, two of which accounted for more than 10%, representing 45.9% and 30.5%, respectively.

Financial information about our segments is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 16, Segment Information, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
 
Our electronics sales businesses experience fluctuations in quarterly performance. Traditionally, the first quarter has a greater amount of sales reflected by our electronics business due to the New Year’s holiday in China. Nevertheless, at times, China can experience particularly inclement weather in January and February which can disrupt the Company’s supply chain management systems. As our business model is to operate only on several days of inventory, the effects of such weather disruptions can be severe.
Customers
 
Two customers accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in 2016, representing 35.4% and 23.5% respectively. Therefore, the loss of any one of these two customers would have a material impact on our business.
Backlog
 
We do not have a material amount of backlog orders as of December 31, 2016.

Government Contracts

No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the Chinese government.
 
Competition
 
We compete against other consumer electronics retailers and wholesalers. We compete principally on the basis of product assortment and availability and value pricing, customer service, store location and convenience and after-sales services. We believe our broad product assortment, competitive pricing and convenient store locations differentiate us from most competitors. Our stores compete by emphasizing a complete product and service solution and value pricing. In addition, our trained and knowledgeable sales and service staff allow us to tailor the offerings to meet the needs of our customers.
