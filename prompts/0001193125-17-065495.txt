INTRODUCTION 
 Overview of Our Services 
 The WebMD Health Network is a leading provider of health information to consumers, physicians and other healthcare professionals through its Websites, mobile apps and health-focused publications. We engage consumers, physicians and other healthcare professionals across a multi-screen experience, allowing us to empower and enable health decisions anytime and anywhere. Advertisers and sponsors use The WebMD Health Network to reach and engage healthcare professionals and consumers who are interested in healthy living, wellness, diseases and conditions, and other health-related topics. We also market services under the WebMD Health Services brand that help employers and health plans improve the health and wellness of their employee and plan participant populations. We generate revenue from the advertising and sponsorship services of The WebMD Health Network, from the wellness services we market to employers and health plans under the WebMD Health Services brand, and from certain information services. 
 Advertising and Sponsorship.    The WebMD Health Network includes: www.WebMD.com (which we sometimes refer to as WebMD Health), our primary Website for consumers and related mobile apps; www.Medscape.com, our primary Website for physicians and other healthcare professionals and related mobile apps; and other Websites through which we provide our branded health and wellness content, tools and services. 

 | Our Websites and mobile applications for consumers help them take an active role in managing their health by providing objective health and wellness information and access to decision-support tools and other services. We also provide content relating to lifestyle and healthy living, including healthy beauty, diet and food, exercise and fitness, and family and pregnancy. Our content offerings for consumers include news articles and features, special reports, interactive guides, originally produced videos, self-assessment questionnaires, expert led Q&As, community discussions, and reference resources.

 | Our Websites and mobile applications for healthcare professionals help them improve their clinical knowledge and practice of medicine. We make it easier for physicians and other healthcare professionals to access clinical reference sources, to stay abreast of the latest clinical information, to learn about new treatment options, to earn continuing medical education (or CME) and continuing education (or CE) credit, and to communicate with peers. Medscapes original content includes daily medical news, conference coverage and expert commentary and columns by authors from widely respected clinical and academic institutions. Medscape also provides access to full-text journal articles, reference materials and other medical content. Through Medscape Education (www.medscape.org), we offer a wide selection of free online CME and CE activities designed to educate healthcare professionals about important diagnostic and therapeutic issues. Our Medscape App for physicians and other healthcare professionals provides formulary information, medical calculators, drug, disease and condition references, and a drug interaction checker. In addition, our Medscape App provides physicians access to Medscape Consult, an online community where physicians can share and discuss clinical cases in real time in a moderated environment. Our Medscape CME & Education App enables healthcare professionals to access Medscape Education CME and CE activities on iPhone® and iPad® and to earn and track CME and CE credits for completed Medscape Education activities. Our Medscape MedPulse App enables healthcare professionals to stay up-to-date on the latest medical news and expert perspectives.

 We do not charge any usage, membership or download fees for access to the Websites and mobile apps in The WebMD Health Network. We generate revenue from The WebMD Health Network primarily through the sale of various types of advertising and sponsorship services to our clients, which include: pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies; hospitals, clinics and other healthcare services companies; health

  insurance providers; consumer products companies whose products or services relate to health, wellness, diet, fitness, lifestyle, safety and illness prevention; and various other businesses, organizations and governmental entities. Advertisers and sponsors use our services to reach, educate and inform target audiences of consumers, physicians and other healthcare professionals. We also generate revenue through the sale of advertising in WebMD Magazine, a consumer publication that we distribute free of charge to physician office waiting rooms and make available online and through an iPad app. 
 Advertising and Sponsorship revenue for 2016 was approximately $561.3 million or 79.6% of our total revenue, and for 2015 was approximately $499.0 million or 78.4% of our total revenue. In each of 2016 and 2015, approximately 60% of our Advertising and Sponsorship revenue was from our Medscape Websites and mobile apps for physicians and other healthcare professionals. Our Advertising and Sponsorship revenue is reported in two groups: 

 | Biopharma and Medical Device revenue, which consists of advertising and sponsorship revenue from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device clients relating to prescription pharmaceutical products or other regulated devices or products or for sponsoring educational programs, and was approximately $428.5 million and $371.2 million, respectively, in 2016 and 2015; and

 | OTC, CPG and Other revenue, which consists of advertising and sponsorship revenue relating to non-Rx or over-the-counter medications and other healthcare products, food and beverages, beauty products and other consumer products, as well as revenue from clients such as retailers, pharmacies, hospitals, health insurance companies and government agencies and market research companies where we provide physician recruitment services, and was approximately $132.8 million and $127.8 million, respectively, in 2016 and 2015.

 Health Services.     Under the WebMD Health Services brand, we market wellness services and solutions that help employers and health plans improve the health and well-being of their employee and plan participant populations. We host our WebMD Health Services platform for our employer and health plan clients. Our cloud-based online services can be accessed by their employees and plan participants using a computer, a tablet or a smartphone. Our flexible architecture allows us to integrate with the clients existing programs, websites and intranets. 
 Our services help our clients employees and plan participants make informed decisions about health risks and lifestyle choices. Our solutions start with an assessment of individual health and well-being and then work to provide personalized paths for improving or maintaining health. We also offer clients the ability to design team-based and individual wellness challenges that help foster a culture of wellness in the workplace. In addition, our health and wellness coaching programs, available onsite and telephonically and focusing on lifestyle, condition management, weight management and tobacco cessation, help participants make healthier choices to achieve their health and well-being goals. The WebMD Digital Health AssistantSM offers online, self-directed health coaching which enables participants to set and track wellness goals and follow self-paced personal action plans. 
 We generate revenue from employer and health plan subscriptions to our WebMD Health Services platform, either directly or through distributor relationships. In addition, clients are charged on a per participant basis for our health and wellness coaching programs. Health Services revenue for 2016 was $113.9 million or 16.2% of our total revenue, and for 2015 was $110.4 million or 17.3% of our total revenue. No Health Services revenue comes from advertising or sponsorship and no advertising is displayed through the WebMD Health Services platform. 
 Information Services.    We sell certain information products and services on a stand-alone basis using de-identified data that we license from a small number of third-party data sources, of which the principal source is a license from Change Healthcare to HLTH Corporation (which we refer to as HLTH), our former parent company. As the successor to HLTH, this license provides us the rights to certain de-identified data from Change Healthcare through early February 2018 for use in the development and commercialization of various information products and services. Customers for these information services include data services, informatics and consulting companies.

Index to Financial Statements
 Our revenue from the products and services that utilize data under the current Change Healthcare license is highly profitable and is reported net of the royalties and commissions that we pay to Change Healthcare or others. We do not expect that the current license agreement with Change Healthcare will continue after February 2018, and expect that if such agreement is renewed or is replaced with new third-party data sources, the terms of any such renewal or replacement license would not be as favorable to us as those in the current agreement. Change Healthcare is in the process of merging with McKesson Corporation and, as a result, discussions around extending our agreement with Change Healthcare have stalled. We are exploring other sources of third-party data and uses of our first party data to generate additional revenue streams, but we are early in that process. Accordingly, we expect that the sales of, and the profits generated by, our information services business will be materially adversely affected by the expiration, in early February 2018, of our license agreement with Change Healthcare. 
 Information Services revenue for 2016 was $29.8 million or 4.2% of our total revenue, and for 2015 was $26.9 million or 4.2% of our total revenue. 
 Recent Developments 
 On February 16, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors, working together with our management team and legal and financial advisors, had commenced a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value. These alternatives could include, among other things, the sale of part or all of the company, a merger with another party or other strategic transaction, or continuing to execute on WebMDs business plan. Our Board has not set a timetable for this process. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a transaction. 
Corporate Information

 Our Editorial Policies.    We are dedicated to providing quality health and wellness information and to upholding the integrity of our editorial process. The goal of our Editorial Policies is to maintain WebMD as an objective, practical and relevant content source for health and medical information. Our editorial staff is separate and distinct from our staff that works with advertisers and sponsors. Our Editorial Policies prohibit the modifying of a story on behalf of, or for the benefit of, an advertiser or sponsor. 
 Our original content is reviewed by medical reviewers and by our editors for accuracy, objectivity, appropriateness of medical language, and proper characterization of findings. The medical reviewer  and a link to his or her biography  is identified on WebMD content. We also uphold traditional journalistic principles in reviewing and corroborating information from other sources. When WebMD licenses health and wellness content from third parties for publication, our editors review the third partys editorial policies and procedures for consistency with the WebMD Editorial Policies. In addition, our physician reviewers and other editorial staff review a representative sample of the third partys content to ensure that such third party follows the editorial policies and procedures reviewed by WebMD. 
 Our Policies Regarding Advertisements, Sponsorships and Promotions.    All advertisements, sponsorships and promotions that appear on our Websites are subject to our Advertising Policy and/or our Sponsor Policy. We do not accept advertising that, in our opinion, is not factually accurate or is not in good taste. WebMD makes a clear distinction between the news stories, articles and other original content that we create or license and the promotional information that is created or supplied by our sponsors. While content from a sponsor is subject to our Advertising Policy, it is not subject to our Editorial Policy. The sponsor is responsible for the accuracy and objectivity of its content and it is not reviewed by our Editorial Department for accuracy, objectivity or balance. Sponsors may also provide funding directly to WebMD without the sponsor having any control over the content. 
 Consumer Services 
 Introduction.    The Internet has fundamentally changed the way consumers obtain information, enabling them to have immediate access to searchable information and dynamic interactive content. Healthcare consumers increasingly seek to educate themselves online about their health-related issues, motivated in part by the larger share of healthcare costs they are being asked to bear due to changes in the benefit designs being offered by health plans and employers. Our goal is to provide consumers with an objective and trusted source of information and online tools that help them play an active role in managing their health. We also provide content relating to lifestyle and healthy living, including healthy beauty, diet and food, exercise and fitness, and family and pregnancy.

 In the past several years, video and multimedia applications have become an important part of what users expect from Internet sites. In addition, consumers are increasingly using the Internet to access social media as a means to communicate and exchange information, including information regarding health and wellness. Consumers are also increasingly using smartphones and tablets to access online content and tools. We have invested and intend to continue to invest in software and systems that allow us to meet the demands of our users and sponsors, including customized content management and publishing technology to deliver interactive content, multimedia programming and personalized health applications that engage our users. In addition, we continue to focus on delivering a multi-screen platform that extends the user experience onto mobile devices and tablets.

 International.    Since October 2009, we have operated a health information Website in the United Kingdom with Boots UK, the United Kingdoms leading pharmacy-led health and beauty retailer. The co-branded Boots/WebMD site at www.WebMD.boots.com features daily health and wellness news, condition and healthy living centers, interactive health tools, WebMDs symptom checker, specialized health search, health videos and interactive slide shows. 
 We may pursue additional opportunities to expand the reach of the WebMD brand outside the United States. However, because of restrictions on consumer advertising by pharmaceutical and medical device companies that apply in many countries, we expect to focus our efforts outside the United States primarily on expanding our Medscape offerings for physicians and other healthcare professionals, rather than consumer offerings. For additional information, see  Professional Services  International below. 
 Social Media and Video Initiatives.    Until 2015, most of our efforts to grow our consumer audience and to monetize traffic were focused on content delivered on our own consumer Websites and apps. However, people are increasingly using social media platforms not only to connect with their friends and family but also to find and consume information. Accordingly, in 2015, we began actively pursuing a strategy to take our content and the WebMD brand off-network into new environments. To implement that strategy, we are building the infrastructure to develop content offerings that are tailored for specific social networks and platforms and to allow consumers to more easily discover, share and interact with content from WebMD in other online locations. Our strategy will, in some cases, allow us to drive people back to WebMDs own sites and apps, where we can monetize that traffic as we do today; in other cases, we may be able to take advantage of new monetization models as we engage with users outside of The WebMD Health Network. 
 Another key aspect of these initiatives is to create video content that is both highly engaging and easily sharable across social networks. WebMDs video offerings include both short, social-friendly how-to and explainers as well as news and personality-driven features. While WebMD has developed a majority of its original video programming in-house, WebMD also uses independent production companies to augment and enhance its lineup. Video topics include specific health conditions, as well as healthy living and wellness topics. We are also continuing to develop longer-form video offerings. In 2016, we launched DNA Brand Studio, a full-service creative studio that focuses on producing a range of branded video and interactive solutions for marketers and agency partners. DNA Brand Studio will build on the work the company has been doing with pre- and post-roll video, infographics, and social content for a range of clients and brands. 
 WebMD Magazine 
 WebMD Magazine is a print magazine delivered free of charge to physicians in the United States for use in their office waiting rooms and reaches consumers right before they meet with their physicians. This allows sponsors to extend their advertising reach and to deliver their message when consumers are actively engaged in the healthcare process, and allows us to extend the WebMD brand into offline channels. We publish eight issues per year and had a rate base, in 2016, of over 1.4 million copies of each issue. We estimate that approximately 10 million people are reading each issue of WebMD Magazine. 
 The editorial format of WebMD Magazine is specifically designed for the physicians waiting room. Its editorial features and highly interactive format of assessments, quizzes and questions are designed to inform consumers about important health and wellness topics. We also publish a digital edition of WebMD Magazine online and, as described under  Mobile above, WebMD Magazine is available as a free interactive application for the iPad®. We also produce certain specialized editions of WebMD Magazine, including one for college campuses and one that focuses on diabetes.

 Advertising and Sponsorship 
 We believe that The WebMD Health Network offers an efficient means for advertisers and sponsors to reach a large audience of health-involved consumers, clinically active physicians and other healthcare professionals or to target specific groups of consumers, physicians and other healthcare professionals based on their interests or specialties with placements in relevant locations on The WebMD Health Network or in our e-newsletters. The following are some of the types of placements and programs we offer to advertisers and sponsors: 

 | Media Solutions. These are traditional online advertising solutions, such as banners, used to reach health-involved consumers and physicians and other healthcare professionals. In addition, customers can select targeted media packages, including condition-specific or specialty-specific e-newsletters, keyword searches and educational programs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Sponsored Solutions. These are customized collections of articles, topics, and decision-support tools and applications, sponsored by clients and distributed within The WebMD Health Network. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The pricing for our advertising and sponsorship services varies from contract to contract based on numerous factors, including the specific services to be provided, the content areas where advertisements or sponsored content are to be displayed, the nature of any exclusivity provided, the total size of the commitment by the sponsor, and other factors. We also sell advertising on a CPM (cost per thousand impressions) basis, where an advertiser can purchase a set amount of impressions on that basis. An impression is a single instance of an ad appearing on a Web page. However, our services for advertisers and sponsors are generally more complex and have more complex pricing than simple cost per thousand impressions pricing. 
 We create content on specific topics and program various parts of The WebMD Health Network to build and maintain traffic in areas most important to both our audience and our advertising and sponsorship clients. For example, the total Medscape audience is small compared to the total audience of The WebMD Health Network, but Medscape contributed approximately 60% of our advertising and sponsorship revenue in 2016 because of the high value our clients place on being able to reach the Medscape audience of physicians and other healthcare professionals or to reach targeted portions of that Medscape audience. 
 As our audience of mobile users continues to grow, we are seeing increased acceptance of and demand for mobile advertising and sponsorship programs from our customers. While we offer mobile as a standalone purchase, our advertising and sponsorship clients are generally interested in reaching a targeted audience, regardless of what device the user is engaging on, and choose multi-platform advertising and sponsorship programs. With our significant scale in both desktop and mobile audience engagement and our ability to reach targeted portions of our audience, we believe that The WebMD Health Network is well-positioned to meet the needs of our advertising and sponsorship clients. 
 We have been investing in improved data analytics capabilities to enhance our ability to demonstrate to advertisers and sponsors how promotional strategies implemented through WebMD impact physician and consumer behaviors and preferences. Enhanced analytic capabilities also support WebMDs internal development of user engagement strategies and new messaging and education services. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales, marketing and account management personnel work with pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies, hospitals, health insurance companies, governmental entities and consumer products companies and their ad agencies to place their advertisements and other sponsored products on The WebMD Health Network and in WebMD Magazine. These individuals work closely with clients and potential clients and their agencies to develop innovative ways to bring their companies and their products and services to the attention of specific groups of consumers and healthcare professionals, and to create channels of communication with these audiences.

 WEBMD HEALTH SERVICES 
 Introduction 
 In response to increasing healthcare costs, employers and health plans are taking steps to motivate employees and plan participants to live healthier lives and use healthcare in a cost-effective manner. Since lifestyle decisions, including nutrition, exercise and tobacco use, are key drivers of health and can dramatically impact risks for acquiring chronic, costly conditions, employers and health plans seek to reduce demand for healthcare services by focusing on programs and initiatives that help employees and health plan participants take positive action to improve their health and well-being and reduce their health risks. 
 Our cloud-based platform helps employers and health plans improve the health and well-being of their employee and plan participant populations and, as a result, manage their healthcare costs. We host our WebMD Health Services platform for employers and health plans for use by their employees and plan participants (we generally refer to the individuals given access to our services by their employers and health plans as participants below). We provide personalized content, tools and other resources relevant to the specific participants eligibility, coverage and well-being profile. Our online services can be accessed by participants using a desktop computer, a tablet or a smartphone. Our flexible architecture allows us to integrate with the clients existing programs, websites and intranets. As described more fully below, our WebMD Health Services solutions also include telephonic and onsite individual health and wellness coaching, including lifestyle, condition management, weight management and tobacco cessation programs that help participants make lifestyle choices to achieve their health and well-being goals. We also offer clients the ability to design team-based and individual wellness challenges that help foster a culture of wellness in the workplace. 
 We generate revenue from subscriptions to our WebMD Health Services platform by employers and health plans, either directly or through distribution relationships, including relationships with employee benefits outsourcing companies, employee benefits consultants and other companies that assist employers in purchasing or managing employee benefits. In addition, we offer our health and wellness coaching and condition management services on a per participant basis. Our WebMD Health Services online platform does not display advertisements or generate revenue from advertising or sponsorship. 
Our Online Platform and Related Services 
 Overview.    Our WebMD Health Services platform has been designed to integrate complex data from multiple sources, including self-reported health information, medical and pharmacy claims data, electronic medical records and lab results. Through our device and app connection center, we can import personal health data from devices, monitors and apps used for health and fitness purposes. Once the information from any of these multiple sources has been imported into a participants profile, it can be used in other WebMD Health Services products, such as in connection with issuing rewards, designing wellness challenges or participating in one of our coaching programs. Each participants health profile drives personalized messaging to the individual, including recommendations for educational resources and online tools. Through our platform integration capabilities, we can assess a participants current health and well-being and provide targeted opportunities for people to achieve their goals. 
 Health Assessments.    Our proprietary health assessment (sometimes referred to in the industry as a health risk assessment), once completed by the participant, helps identify modifiable risk factors and health conditions. The health assessment also provides participants, based on their individual risks and conditions, with initial personalized steps they can take to lead a healthier life. In addition, we offer on-site biometric screening events through partner relationships, which provide participants with immediate feedback on health risks and recommendations on behavior changes that can minimize them. 
 WebMD Personal Health RecordSM.    Our WebMD Personal Health RecordSM provides a secure repository for self-reported and professionally sourced health data. The Personal Health Record helps participants gather, store, manage and share this data, which can potentially reduce medication conflicts, duplication of health services and overspending. Medical and pharmacy claims data and data from electronic medical records can be

  automatically imported. The Personal Health Record allows participants to authorize access by healthcare providers, which can encourage better communication and coordination of care. Through the portability feature, we offer participants the ability to access their health record even if they change jobs, health plans or providers. We also provide the capability to upload, track, and share data from mobile devices and home medical devices. Our health trackers and related solutions allow individuals to graphically track health measurements over time. 
 Data Interchange.    The WebMD Health Services platform enables bi-directional transmission of a populations health and well-being information. Our platform employs multiple secure methods for transferring and exchanging data to support a wide range of imports, including claims data, lab results, device data and self-reported data and exports of demographic and eligibility data, health assessment results, coaching results and program data, and secure messages. Through this, our Data Interchange allows the clients portal to serve as the centralized information hub for participants well-being. 
 WebMD Device and App Connection Center.    This service enables participants to connect, sync, and track personal health data from a variety of popular digital health wearables into our platform, which aggregates the data into an accessible and understandable personal dashboard of key health and wellness indicators. 
 Our Mobile Apps.    Our Android and iOS-compatible native apps offer participants seamless access to our mobile-optimized site solutions. Wellness at Your Side is integrated with the mobile site, and enables participants to set lifestyle goals, track progress, earn rewards, and get personalized wellness recommendations. Daily Victory is designed to support participants in tracking incremental lifestyle changes one day at a time. Weigh Today helps participants form the healthy habit of weighing themselves daily. 
 WebMD Health and Wellness Coaching 
 WebMD Health and Wellness Coaching focuses on supporting and motivating individuals to take actionable steps to improve their health status. We tailor our coaching programs to the goals of our clients by offering four types of coaching. Individuals are notified about their eligibility to participate in health coaching under programs selected by their employer or health plan. Our health coaching services, together with our online services, not only can help high-risk individuals identify important risk factors and change unhealthy behaviors, but also can help moderate-risk individuals to lower their risks and those who are healthy to stay that way. Our health coaches provide information and guidance to help participants better manage modifiable risk factors, or if they are healthy, to adopt lifestyle behaviors that can help them maintain their health. Our coaching services are available telephonically, onsite or are integrated into our online coaching platform. 
 Our Lifestyle Coaching gives people the solutions and information they need to stay healthy and to improve and manage modifiable risk factors. Our program addresses such behaviors as stress management and nutrition and guides participants through the basics of a healthy, wellness-focused life. Our Condition Management coaching targets specific health needs of participants with chronic, high-risk conditions, including diabetes, heart failure, asthma, coronary artery disease and COPD. Coaches work to support participants in optimal management of these illnesses to achieve the highest level of well-being. Two specialty coaching programs, for Tobacco Cessation and Weight Management, offer participants solutions and guidance on reaching goals and sustaining health improvement and healthy habits over time. 
 The WebMD Digital Health AssistantSM offers online, self-directed health coaching programs focusing on exercise, nutrition, smoking cessation, weight management, emotional health and stress management. These programs let participants set and track wellness goals, learn more about their behaviors and risks and follow self-paced personal action plans to improve their health. Each program includes education modules and interactive goal setting and experience tracking. 
 Other Services 
 Onsite Services.    We offer onsite support to our clients to plan and implement health and well-being programs. Our onsite wellness coordinators augment in-house staff with the development and execution of health and well-being seminars, lunch-and-learns, and health and wellness fairs.

 COMPETITION 
 The markets we participate in are intensely competitive, continually evolving and, in some cases, are subject to rapid change. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, and some are better known than we are. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations. 
 Competition for The WebMD Health Network
Overview.    The Websites and mobile apps in The WebMD Health Network face competition from numerous other companies, both in attracting users and in generating revenue from advertisers and sponsors, and we expect that additional competitors will continue to enter the markets we participate in. Our advertisers and sponsors have numerous alternatives to choose from, including traditional media, Internet search engines, social media Internet sites, and general interest consumer sites, as well as the alternative of communicating through their own Websites or other channels that they manage in-house or through their advertising agencies. Such competition may result in smaller customer commitments or pressure to reduce prices, both of which could reduce our revenues and profit margins. Competitors for the attention of consumers and healthcare professionals also include public sector, non-profit and other Websites that provide healthcare information without advertising or sponsorships from third parties, including: Healthfinder.gov (published by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion of HHS); Websites from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (or CDC); and Websites from the National Institutes of Health (or NIH), which publishes MedlinePlus.

 REGULATORY MATTERS 
 Introduction 
 Healthcare Regulation.    The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. Most of our revenue is derived either directly from the healthcare industry or from other sources that are subject to healthcare laws and related regulations and could be affected by changes in those laws and regulations. This section of our Annual Report contains a description of healthcare laws and regulations applicable to us, either directly or through their effect on our healthcare industry customers, as well as healthcare industry standards that serve a self-regulatory function, and certain related matters. We anticipate that the U.S. Executive Branch, U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs, particularly given the ongoing scrutiny regarding healthcare pricing in the U.S. generally, and prescription drug pricing specifically. Changes in healthcare laws, regulations and standards may create unexpected liabilities for us, may cause us to incur additional costs and may restrict our operations. In addition, our customers expectations regarding such changes may affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to products and services of the types we provide. 
 Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application to specific products, services, and business arrangements may not be clear. In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the healthcare information services that we provide. These laws, regulations and industry standards may nonetheless be applied to our products, services, and business arrangements in ways we cannot accurately anticipate, which could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business. Even in areas where we are not subject to healthcare regulation directly, we may become involved in governmental actions or investigations through our relationships with customers that are regulated, and participation in such actions or investigations, even if we are not a party and not the subject of an investigation, may cause us to incur significant expenses. 
 Other Regulation.    This section of our Annual Report also contains a description of other laws and regulations, including general consumer protection laws and Internet-related laws that may affect our operations. Laws and regulations have been adopted, and may be adopted in the future, that address Internet-related issues, including online content, privacy, online marketing, unsolicited commercial email, taxation, pricing, and quality of products and services. Some of these laws and regulations were adopted relatively recently, and their scope and application may still be subject to uncertainties. Interpretations of these laws, as well as any new or revised laws or regulations, could decrease demand for our services, increase our cost of doing business, or otherwise cause our business to suffer. 
 Regulation of Drug and Medical Device Advertising and Promotion 
 The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, regulate the form, content and dissemination of labeling, advertising and promotional materials prepared by, or for, pharmaceutical or medical device companies. The FTC regulates over-the-counter (OTC) drug and dietary supplement advertising and, in some cases, medical device advertising. Based on FDA requirements, regulated companies must limit advertising and promotional materials to discussions of FDA-approved uses and claims. In limited circumstances, regulated companies may disseminate certain non-promotional scientific information or disease-state information. 
 Information on our Websites that promotes the use of pharmaceutical products or medical devices is subject to FDA and FTC requirements and enforcement actions, and information regarding other products and services is subject to FTC requirements. If either agency finds that information on our Websites violates regulations or guidance, it may take regulatory or judicial action against us or the advertiser or sponsor of that information. State attorneys general may also take similar action based on their states consumer protection statutes. Areas of our Websites that could be the primary focus of regulators include pages and programs that discuss use of a regulated product or that the regulators believe may lack editorial independence from the control of sponsoring pharmaceutical or device companies. Television broadcast advertisements that we may provide may also be 
 
21 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  subject to FTC and FDA regulation, depending on the content. The agencies place the principal burden of compliance with advertising and promotional regulations on advertisers and sponsors to make truthful, substantiated claims. 
 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and its implementing regulations require that prescription drugs be approved by the FDA prior to marketing. It is a violation to market, advertise or otherwise commercialize such products prior to approval. The FDA allows for preapproval exchange of scientific information, provided it is non-promotional in nature and does not draw conclusions regarding the ultimate safety or effectiveness of the unapproved drug. The FDA also refrains from regulating certain disease state materials so long as those materials do not make a representation or suggestion about a drug or device. Upon approval or clearance, the FDAs regulatory authority extends to the labeling and advertising of prescription drugs and medical devices. Such products may be promoted and advertised only for uses reviewed and approved by the FDA. Labeling and advertising can be neither false nor misleading and must present all material information, including risk information, in a clear, conspicuous and neutral manner. There are also requirements for certain information (the prescribing information or package insert for promotional labeling and the brief summary for advertising) to be part of labeling and advertising. Labeling and advertising that violate these legal standards are subject to enforcement. 
 The FDA also regulates the safety, effectiveness, and labeling of OTC drugs either through specific product approvals or through regulations that define approved claims for specific categories of products. The FTC regulates the advertising of OTC drugs and dietary supplements under the section of the Federal Trade Commission Act that prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices. The FDA and FTC regulatory framework requires that OTC drugs and dietary supplements be formulated and labeled in accordance with FDA approvals or regulations and promoted in a manner that is truthful, adequately substantiated, and consistent with the labeled uses. OTC drugs that do not meet these requirements are subject to FDA or FTC enforcement action depending on the nature of the violation. In addition, state attorneys general may bring enforcement actions for alleged unfair or deceptive advertising. 
 There are several administrative, civil and criminal sanctions available to the FDA for violations of the FDC Act or FDA regulations as they relate to labeling and advertising. Administrative sanctions include a written request that violative advertising or promotion cease and/or that corrective action be taken, such as requiring a company to provide to healthcare providers and/or consumers information to correct misinformation previously conveyed. More serious civil sanctions include seizures, injunctions, fines and consent decrees. Any of these enforcement measures could prevent a company from introducing or maintaining its product in the marketplace. Criminal penalties for severe violations can result in a prison term and/or substantial fines. State attorneys general have similar investigative tools and sanctions available to them. 
 In the last 15 years, the FDA has gradually relaxed its formerly restrictive policies on direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, allowing companies to advertise prescription drugs to consumers in any medium, provided that they satisfy FDA requirements. For example, in August 2015, the FDA issued revised draft guidance regarding the brief summary requirement for prescription drug advertising and promotional labeling in print media, allowing those statements to focus primarily on the most clinically significant information on the most serious and the most common risks associated with the product(s). If, in the future, the FDA issues more restrictive policies or guidance regarding direct-to-consumer advertising or if new laws or regulations impose additional restrictions on such advertising, it could become more difficult for us to obtain advertising and sponsorship revenue. 
 In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act) became law. It contains a number of provisions designed to speed development of innovative therapies, to provide public science funding, and to permit faster evaluation of new medical products and new indications for existing prescription drugs and devices. The Cures Act includes amendments to the statutory provision addressing pharmacoeconomic claims in drug advertising, but otherwise does not directly affect the core of our business. In January 2017, the FDA issued two guidance documents that relaxed certain of its policies that had restricted prescription drug advertising. These documents interpret the scope of prescription drug labeling and the statutory provision related to pharmacoeconomic claims more permissively than in past FDA enforcement actions and may permit our clients 
 
22 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  to engage in advertising that may previously have been considered improper. We do not know how the Cures Act or these guidance documents will be applied or how they might affect our business, but we will closely monitor the changes and comply with the requirements to the extent they apply. 
 There are also advertising restrictions that apply outside of the United States. Under European laws, there are several restrictions regarding advertising of drugs or medical devices. There are, in particular, broad prohibitions on the advertising of prescription or reimbursed drugs to the general public, the use of indirect or disguised marketing, and the offering and providing of gifts or benefits with promotional purpose that are not of minor value. If the relevant European national competent authorities find that any of our products and services, or any information on our Websites or in our mobile applications, violate applicable regulations, they may take regulatory or judicial action against us and/or the advertisers or sponsors of that information. Moreover, our competitors, or even competitors of advertisers and sponsors, may take actions against us and/or advertisers or sponsors of the information. 
 Regulation of Mobile Applications and Other Mobile Health Technology 
 The FDA regulates medical devices in the U.S. Some health-related applications running on mobile platforms, as well as other health-related software products, among other types of products, are considered medical devices. Such actively regulated medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local authorities. In order to be subject to FDA regulation, the particular application or product must meet the definition of a medical device as provided in the FDC Act. In February 2015, the FDA clarified via guidance document that the agency intends to actively regulate only those mobile applications that meet the agencys definition of device and that could pose a risk to patients safety if they fail to work as intended. The FDA is exercising enforcement discretion, meaning that they will not actively enforce FDC Act regulatory requirements, with respect to certain lower risk mobile applications that meet the device definition, such as those that maintain or encourage a general state of health or a healthy activity. In addition, the FDA has recently proposed refraining from exercising active enforcement over certain products that promote health or healthy lifestyles that reduce the risk or impact of certain diseases or conditions. 
 In light of current FDA guidance, we believe that none of our existing online services and mobile applications are subject to regulation as a medical device under applicable FDA regulations. We are required to determine whether FDA regulations would apply to any of our applications and the FDA could disagree with our determination. If the FDA disagrees, the agency may take regulatory action against us. It is also possible that products or services that we may offer in the future could subject us to such regulation or that current rules could change or be interpreted to apply to some of our existing online services or mobile applications. In addition, it is possible that our mobile health offerings could fall under the scope of the FTC Act or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009. In April 2016, the FTC released a web-based tool in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and Office for Civil Rights (OCR), and the FDA, to help mobile application developers determine which federal privacy laws might apply to their applications. At the same time, the FTC released guidance aimed at mobile health developer compliance with the FTC Act. In February 2016, OCR posted guidance on its mHealth Developer Portal regarding scenarios in which HIPAA might apply to mobile health applications. Complying with such rules and regulations could be burdensome and expensive and could delay our introduction of new services or applications. 
Regulation and Accreditation of Continuing Medical Education 
 Activities and information provided in the context of an independent medical or scientific educational program, often referred to as continuing medical education, or CME, usually are treated as non-promotional and fall outside the FDAs jurisdiction. The FDA does, however, evaluate CME activities to determine whether they are independent of the promotional influence of the activities supporters. To determine whether a CME providers activities are sufficiently independent, the FDA looks at a number of factors related to the planning, content, speakers and audience selection of such activities. To the extent that the FDA concludes that such activities are not independent, such content must fully comply with the FDAs requirements and restrictions regarding promotional activities. 
 
23 
 
Index to Financial Statements
 Medscape, LLC distributes online CME to physicians and other healthcare professionals and is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), which oversees providers of CME credit. Medscape Education (www.medscape.org) is the Website through which Medscape, LLC distributes online CME. If any CME activity that Medscape, LLC certifies for CME credit is promotional, Medscape, LLC may face regulatory action or the loss of accreditation by the ACCME. Supporters of CME activities may also face regulatory action, potentially leading to termination of support. 
 Medscape, LLCs current ACCME accreditation expires in August 2022. If Medscape, LLC fails to maintain its status as an accredited ACCME provider (whether at the time of such renewal or at an earlier time as a result of a failure to comply with existing or additional ACCME standards), it will not be permitted to certify CME activities for physicians and other healthcare professionals. Instead, Medscape, LLC would be required to use third parties to provide such CME-related certification services. That, in turn, could discourage potential supporters from engaging Medscape, LLC to develop CME or education-related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Medscape, LLCs CME activities are planned and implemented in accordance with the Essential Areas and Elements and the Policies of the ACCME and other applicable accreditation standards. The ACCMEs standards for commercial support of CME are intended to ensure, among other things, that CME activities of ACCME-accredited providers, such as Medscape, LLC, are independent of commercial interests, which are defined as entities that produce, market, re-sell or distribute healthcare goods and services, excluding certain organizations. Commercial interests and entities owned or controlled by commercial interests are ineligible for accreditation by the ACCME. The standards provide that accredited CME providers may not place certain CME content on Websites owned or controlled by a commercial interest. In addition, accredited CME providers may not ask commercial interests for speaker or topic suggestions, and are also prohibited from asking commercial interests to review CME content prior to delivery. Further, there are limitations and requirements for CME providers using employees of a commercial interest as planners or speakers at CME events. 
 From time to time, the ACCME revises its standards for commercial support of CME. As a result of prior ACCME revisions, we have adjusted our corporate structure and made changes to our management and operations intended to allow Medscape, LLC to provide CME activities that are developed independently from those programs developed by its sister companies, which may not be independent of commercial interests. We believe that these changes allow Medscape, LLC to satisfy the applicable standards. 
 Over the years, the ACCME and other organizations have discussed ways to assure that commercial interests do not bias CME activities. The ACCME has published several proposals since 2008, including proposals to reduce communications between commercial interests and CME providers and to create special designations for CME activities that are not funded by commercial interests. The ACCME also suggested creating an independent CME funding entity to build a firewall between commercial interests and CME activities. The ACCME has not adopted these proposals but has revised its policies. It is possible that adoption of additional proposals could significantly affect Medscape, LLCs business model. 
 Government authorities continue to examine pharmaceutical companies financial support of CME, including public reporting requirements as they relate to payments and transfers of value made to physician speakers and faculty involved in CME activities. These authorities interpretation of these reporting requirements, which has been evolving and may continue to change, could affect pharmaceutical companies views of their reporting obligations with respect to payments in support of physician speakers and faculty for CME activities. In implementing internal controls and procedures that promote adherence to applicable regulations and requirements, supporters of CME may interpret the regulations and requirements differently and may implement varying procedures or requirements. These regulations and requirements, which are subject to change, and the related internal controls and procedures: 
 

 | may discourage pharmaceutical companies from providing grants for independent educational activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | may slow their internal approval for such grants;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | may reduce the volume of third-party supported educational programming on Medscape Education to levels that are lower than in the past, thereby reducing revenue; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
24 
 
Index to Financial Statements
 
 | may require Medscape, LLC and WebMD Global LLC to make changes to how they offer or provide educational programming.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If we are not able to comply with applicable regulations and requirements, then our ability to provide medical education programming will be limited, which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Federal False Claims Act 
 The Federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The whistleblower (or qui tam) provisions of the Federal False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery. After the filing of a qui tam suit, the federal government may intervene and control the case; if it does not, the private individual may pursue the claim on his or her own. In addition, various states and European countries have enacted false claim laws analogous to the Federal False Claims Act, and many of these laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the Federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties. Federal False Claims Act cases have been brought against drug manufacturers, and resulted in significant monetary settlements and the imposition of federally-supervised corporate integrity agreements in circumstances that include allegations that company-sponsored CME was unlawful off-label promotion. It is not clear whether there is a basis for the application of the Federal False Claims Act to the types of services that WebMD provides. However, plaintiffs have in the past, and may in the future, seek to name us as defendants in these types of cases. Any action against us for violation of these laws could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Similarly, Federal False Claims Act actions and resulting corporate integrity agreements involving our customers may reduce the use of our services by our advertising and sponsorship clients. 
HIPAA Privacy Standards and Security Standards 
 The Privacy Standards and Security Standards under HIPAA establish a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers (referred to as covered entities) and their business associates, which are persons or entities that perform certain services for or on behalf of a covered entity (or another business associate) that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. In connection with the sale by HLTH of its Emdeon Business Services (EBS) business, EBS (which is now known as Change Healthcare) agreed to license to HLTH, through early February 2018, certain data, de-identified by Change Healthcare in conformity with HIPAA, for use in the development and commercialization of certain information products and services. We are currently using the data received under this license in our information services products. 
 As a business associate, we are subject to HIPAA with regard to certain aspects of our business, such as managing employee or plan member health information for employers or health plans. With respect to our WebMD Health Services platform and related services, HITECH creates obligations for us to report any unauthorized use or disclosure of protected health information, known as a breach, to our covered entity customers. The 2013 final HITECH rule modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that makes more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. In addition, HITECH and its implementing regulations impose similar data breach notification requirements on vendors of personal health records that require us to notify affected individuals and the FTC in the event of a data breach involving the unsecured personal information of users of the WebMD Health Manager personal health record application on WebMD.com. 
 Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. HITECH increased civil penalty amounts for violations of HIPAA and significantly strengthens enforcement by requiring the HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and authorizing state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA Privacy Standards and Security Standards that threaten the privacy of state residents. In July 2016, OCR announced a new phase of the HIPAA Audit Program, which for the first time targets business associates. Audits may, in certain circumstances, lead to full compliance 
 
25 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  reviews  with the potential for civil or criminal penalties. The HIPAA Privacy Standards and Security Standards may require us to incur additional costs and may restrict our business operations. These provisions, as modified by the 2013 final HITECH rule, may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our customers and strategic partners. 
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) 
 The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (referred to as GINA), enacted in May 2008, does not apply directly to WebMD, although it does apply to our WebMD Health Services platform customers, including both employers and group health plans. GINA was enacted to prevent discrimination by group health plans, health insurance issuers and employers on the basis of genetic information. Our WebMD Health Services health assessment is typically offered to employees by their employer, group health plan or health insurance issuer as a voluntary component of a wellness program. The U.S. Departments of Labor, HHS and Treasury published Interim Final Rules implementing portions of Title I of GINA in October 2009. The Interim Final Rules prohibit health plans and health insurance issuers from requesting, requiring or purchasing genetic information prior to or in connection with enrollment, or at any time for underwriting purposes, and state that underwriting purposes includes any incentive or disincentive (such as decreasing or increasing premiums) for completing a health assessment. Genetic information is defined broadly to include information about an individuals family medical history. The agencies have not finalized the regulations to date. However, in September 2010, the departments provided additional guidance in the form of frequently asked questions stating that, while a plan may not require an individual to complete a health assessment that requests family medical history in order to receive a wellness program reward, it may use genetic information to make a determination regarding payment, or regarding the medical appropriateness of a treatment or service. HHS also issued a final rule implementing Section 105 of GINA in January 2013. The final rule specifically provides that genetic information is a type of health information that is covered by HIPAAs Privacy Standards and Security Standards, and specifically prohibits it from being used or disclosed for underwriting purposes (including any incentive or disincentive for completing a health assessment). 
 Title II of GINA prohibits employment discrimination based on genetic information as well as the request or purchase of genetic information of employees or their family members, with limited exceptions. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued final rules implementing Title II in November 2010 and amended them in 2016. The final rules specify that genetic information may be collected in a health assessment that is part of a wellness program only if participation in the collection of such information is voluntary. However, they allow an incentive, limited to the 30% maximum under HIPAA, to be provided for a spouse to provide information about the spouses own manifestation of a disease or disorder. That feature of the rules has been challenged in federal court, but so far the court has declined to block it. 
 While each customer is responsible for ensuring that the wellness and benefit selections it offers are compliant with GINA, WebMD may face challenges as a result of varying interpretations of the law by our customers and by the multiple enforcing agencies and uncertainties over the final form of certain of the rules. Our customers interpretations of the law have required us to modify our WebMD Health Services health assessment product, and we could experience increases in operational costs or decreases in demand for our products. 
 State legislation, such as some in California prohibiting any form of discrimination by businesses based on genetic information, including in housing, public accommodation, and the provision of emergency services, could have additional implications for service we provide in those states. 
 Other Restrictions Regarding Confidentiality, Privacy and Security of Health Information 
 In addition to HIPAA, numerous other state and federal laws, including those described in Consumer Protection Regulation below, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health and prescriber information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information. In some cases, more protective state privacy and security laws are not preempted by the HIPAA Privacy Standards and Security Standards and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our customers and strategic partners. 
 
26 
 
Index to Financial Statements
 These laws at a state or federal level, or new interpretations of these laws, could create liability for us, could impose additional operational requirements on our business, could affect the manner in which we use and transmit patient information and could increase our cost of doing business. Claims of violations of privacy rights or contractual breaches, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. 
 Anti-Corruption Laws 
 The United States and other countries have adopted anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit directly or indirectly giving, offering or promising inducements to public officials to elicit an improper commercial advantage. Under applicable U.S., U.K., German, and most European law, this prohibition has been interpreted to apply to doctors and other medical professionals who work in state-run hospitals and state-run healthcare systems outside the United States. Some of these laws also prohibit directly or indirectly giving, offering or promising (and, in some cases, accepting or soliciting) inducements to (or from) private parties (even self-employed HCPs) to elicit (or grant) an improper commercial advantage. In recent years, the U.S. government and governmental authorities outside the U.S. have brought enforcement actions that resulted in significant monetary penalties against several companies operating in the global healthcare industry for violations of anti-corruption laws resulting from illegal payments made to non-U.S. medical professionals. 
 As our business expands outside the United States, we (and others acting on our behalf) increasingly interact with public officials, as well as non-U.S. doctors and other medical professionals, at least some of whom work in state-run hospitals or state-run healthcare systems. Such interactions inherently increase the risk of violating applicable anti-corruption laws. While we believe that we have appropriate compliance policies and procedures in place to mitigate such risk, our personnel and others acting on our behalf might engage in conduct that violates such laws, for which we might be held responsible. Under such circumstances, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties and other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our brand and reputation, as well as our sales activities, could be adversely affected if we were to become the target of any resulting negative publicity. 
 Anti-Kickback Laws 
 There are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships and inducements to healthcare providers and patients. For example, the federal anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients for items or services reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase or order of any item, good, facility or service reimbursed by these programs. Many states and European countries also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a government healthcare program. These laws are applicable to any person or entity, including manufacturers and distributors and, therefore, may restrict how we and some of our customers market products to healthcare providers, including e-details. We carefully review our practices with regulatory experts in an effort to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws. However, the laws in this area are both broad and vague, and it is often difficult or impossible to determine precisely how the laws will be applied, particularly to new services. Penalties for violating the federal anti-kickback law include imprisonment, fines and exclusion from participating, directly or indirectly, in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Any determination by a state, federal, or foreign regulatory agency that any of our practices violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and require us to change or terminate some portions of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 International Regulation 
 We are pursuing opportunities to expand the reach of our brands outside the United States. In certain markets outside the United States, we have entered into agreements or joint ventures with other companies having expertise in the specific country or region, and we may do that in additional markets where we believe it is appropriate; in other such markets, we have relied primarily on our own internal resources, and we expect to do 
 
27 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  that in additional markets in the future. We structure our participation in markets outside the United States in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to such participation. However, as in the United States, the healthcare industry is highly regulated in many other jurisdictions, and we may not be able to accurately anticipate the applicability of healthcare laws and regulations to our participation in such markets. 
 Many European countries have adopted laws and regulations similar to the U.S. laws and regulations described elsewhere in this section of our Annual Report. These include, for example, regulations like the anti-kickback laws, false claim laws, medical professional regulations, genetic privacy and nondiscrimination regulations, restrictions regarding advertising and promotion of drugs and medical devices, sunshine regulations and CME regulations. These European laws and regulations may impose additional operational requirements or restrictions on our business, and increase our cost of doing business. For example, we have implemented certain Website access restrictions that are intended to limit the display of advertising of drugs and medical devices if required by local law, so that such advertising will be seen only by appropriate healthcare professionals. If the applicable regulatory authorities find our access restrictions to be inadequate, they may require us to establish stricter access restrictions. Moreover, such authorities and/or our competitors or even competitors of our advertisers and sponsors may take action against us and/or our advertisers or sponsors if they believe that we have violated the applicable laws. 
 In addition, many countries and governmental bodies have, or are developing, laws that may apply to online health information services of the types we provide, or to Internet sites generally, including laws regarding the collection, use, storage and dissemination of personal information or patient data. To the extent our operations are located within their jurisdiction or are directed at individuals within their jurisdiction, these laws may apply to us. In addition, those governments may attempt to apply such laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities. To the extent we fail to accurately anticipate the application or interpretation of these laws, we could be subject to liability and adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our business. In Europe, the current national implementations of the existing general data protection Directive 95/46/EC and of the e-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC provide for criminal and administrative sanctions in case of violations, even though criminal sanctions are very rarely imposed. For example, France provides for administrative fines of up to 3,000,000 Euros in case of illegal collection or processing of personally identifiable information. Under the recently passed General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European-wide regulation that will be fully enforceable by May 25, 2018, there will be fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2% of the global sales for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of the global sales for more serious offenses, whichever amount is higher. Some European countries may precipitate the increase of the sanctions without waiting for the GDPR to take effect. The GDPR will increase privacy-related compliance requirements in the EU and has more extensive jurisdictional reach than the existing general data protection Directive 95/46/EC. This more extensive jurisdiction reach increases the likelihood of applicability of European law to entities operating outside the European Union but who process data of European data subjects. 
 In Europe, transfers of EU individuals personal data from EU member states to countries not recognized as having adequate protections for personal data, which includes the U.S., are now regulated by the Directive 95/46/EC and its national implementations. The U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, previously used widely to legitimize transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S., was declared invalid in 2015. Legal challenges to various of the cross-border transfer mechanisms, including the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield which replaced the Safe Harbor Framework in 2016 and EU approved Standard Contractual Clauses may affect the commercial cross-border transfers of personal data, though it is unclear what the outcome of any such a challenge will be. 
 Many European countries have established cost reduction measures within their health systems or are intending to do so. This is intended to reduce the spending of the mainly publicly funded health systems in Europe. For example, Germany has established a risk/benefit drug assessment that adversely affects the prices of newly introduced medicinal products. Thus, it is possible that our advertisers and sponsors will face cost reduction measures and reduce their expenditures or postpone expenditure decisions, including expenditures for our services, which could have material adverse effects on our business. 
 We describe additional laws and regulations that apply to our participation in markets outside the United States elsewhere in this Regulatory Matters section, including under the captions  Regulation of Drug and

Index to Financial Statements
  Medical Device Advertising and Promotion and  Consumer Protection Regulation  General. In addition, under the caption Anti-Corruption Laws, we discuss U.S. and non-U.S. laws relevant to our interactions with public officials outside the U.S. 
Consumer Protection Regulation 
 General.    Advertising and promotional activities presented to visitors on our Websites are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices. We are also subject to various other federal and state consumer protection laws, including the specific ones described later in this section. 
 Internet and mobile user privacy, personal data security and the use of information to track online activities are major issues in the U.S. and abroad. In the U.S., the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to advertising activities and to require that the online collection, use and dissemination of data, including personal information, and the presentation of Website content, comply with certain standards for notice, choice, security and access. Courts may also adopt these developing standards or interpret them in new ways. In many cases, the specific limitations imposed by these standards are subject to interpretation by courts and other governmental authorities. We believe that we are in compliance with the consumer protection standards that apply to our Websites, but a determination by a state or federal agency or court that any of our practices do not meet these standards could result in liability and adversely affect our business. New interpretations of these standards could also require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. In addition, claims that we are violating any such standards could, even if we are not found liable, be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. 
 There is also a possibility of legislation, regulations and increased enforcement activities, relating to behavioral advertising. To the extent that our existing practices are inconsistent with any revised principles, new rules, new legislation and/or future enforcement activities, our business may become subject to restrictions that could reduce our revenues or increase our cost of doing business. 
 The FTC Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, which regulate disclosures relating to endorsements and testimonials, apply to online and social media forums. The FTC also has guidance for online advertising known as the Dot Com Disclosures and for native advertising. Native advertising is considered to be the placement of sponsored content in media that consumers usually use to obtain independent, impartial content, when the sponsored content has the same look and feel as the independent content. The Native Advertising guidelines are a reminder that disclosures regarding sponsored content must be made in a clear and conspicuous manner. The FTC may apply increased scrutiny to the use of endorsements, testimonials, and other advertising content online and through traditional media. We will review any relevant disclosures for compliance with the revised Guides, the revised Dot Com Disclosures, and the Native Advertising Guidance, and we will otherwise endeavor to follow legal standards applicable to advertising. 
 The FTC periodically holds workshops on issues relevant to online consumer privacy and uses the information it collects to help guide its policy and enforcement agenda. For example, in 2014, the FTC held a seminar regarding privacy issues associated with consumer generated and controlled health data, which is relevant to services we offer. Previously, following a series of workshops and prior guidance on online behavioral advertising, the FTC issued a preliminary staff report in December 2010 containing a proposed framework for businesses and policymakers for online consumer privacy issues and, in March 2012, the FTC issued a final report setting forth its views on best practices, to protect the privacy of consumers, to be implemented by companies that collect and use consumer data. There is a possibility of legislation, regulations and increased enforcement activities relating to behavioral advertising and other aspects of consumer data usage, privacy and security. To the extent that our existing practices are inconsistent with any revised principles, new rules, new legislation and/or future enforcement activities, our business may become subject to restrictions that could reduce our revenues or increase our cost of doing business. Moreover, the FTCs staff reports and workshops, and calls for legislation, reflect a continuing governmental interest in, and assessment of, online privacy issues. How these issues are ultimately resolved, whether through self-regulatory programs, legislation

  and regulation or some combination and the specifics of any such regimes, may significantly impact our operations. 
 In Europe, Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council requires the users full information and consent prior to the installation and use of any so-called cookie on a users computer. This Directive has been implemented differently, in various member states of the European Union, and national requirements to remain compliant with the respective laws may vary. Nevertheless, the provisions of this directive, whether effectively implemented in national laws, are now applicable in all the member states of the European Union and enforcement actions are now being considered by local data protection authorities. In January 2017, the European Commission proposed a new EU-wide regulation to replace Directive 2009/136/EC, which if enacted, may impose new privacy requirements for electronic communications, including the use of cookies and similar technologies on a users computer or mobile device.     
 Separately, under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European-wide regulation that will be fully enforceable by May 25, 2018, various new requirements relating to Internet privacy will apply, including for users consent for offline and online marketing. European privacy regulators will continue to publish guidance on GDPR requirements throughout 2017. The GDPR will increase the likelihood of the applicability of European law to entities outside the European Union but processing personal data of European data subjects. Countries outside of Europe are also increasingly focusing on data privacy legislation and regulation. Certain such legislative activity, such as data localization laws, could have an impact on our operations and how we do business. 
 European healthcare advertising laws stipulate several restrictions on advertising of drugs and medical devices to the public. In particular, in several countries, the advertising of prescription drugs to the general public is not allowed. Thus, these European countries require access restrictions for Websites that contain such advertisements, which are only allowed to be addressed to healthcare professionals. Accordingly, Websites in The WebMD Health Network that are addressed to physicians in specific European countries must be accessible only to healthcare professionals by an appropriate access check. If the applicable European competent authority does not acknowledge the respective Website to have appropriate access controls, the authority may require us to establish stricter access controls or ultimately may take action against us. 
 Data Security Regulation.    With the publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information, many states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach involving specified types of consumer information, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. Generally, these laws are limited to electronic data and make some exemptions for certain incidents. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches. The FTC and state attorneys general have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act and similar state laws. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation includes general data breach notification and security requirements. These laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies. We intend to continue to endeavor to protect all consumer data and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of this data. 
 Website Accessibility.    The laws and regulations relating to Website accessibility for persons with disabilities are evolving. We monitor those laws and regulations and seek to comply with their requirements to the extent they apply to our business. Changes in those laws and regulations or new interpretations regarding their application may cause us to have to make changes to our Websites and could result in additional expense to us. However, we believe that it is important that our Websites be accessible by members of our audience who have disabilities and expect to continue our efforts to serve that portion of our audience. 
 CAN-SPAM Act.    The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or the CAN-SPAM Act, regulates commercial emails, provides a right on the part of the recipient to request the sender to stop sending messages, and establishes penalties for the sending of email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. Under the CAN-SPAM Act, senders of commercial emails (and 
 
30 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  other persons who initiate those emails) are required to make sure that those emails do not contain false or misleading transmission information. Commercial emails are required to include a valid return email address and other subject heading information so that the sender and the Internet location from which the message has been sent are accurately identified. Recipients must be furnished with an electronic method of informing the sender of the recipients decision to not receive further commercial emails. In addition, the email must include a postal address of the sender and notice that the email is an advertisement. We believe that our email practices comply with the requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act. Many states have also enacted anti-spam laws. The CAN-SPAM Act preempts many of these statutes. To the extent that these laws are not preempted, we believe that our email practices are designed to comply with these laws. 
 COPPA.    The Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, and associated rules promulgated by the FTC, applies to operators of commercial Websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect personal information from children, and to operators of general audience sites with actual knowledge that they are collecting information from U.S. children under the age of 13. Except for our fit.WebMD.com site, our sites are not directed at children and our general audience site, WebMD Health, states that no one under the applicable age is entitled to use the site. In addition, WebMD Health employs a kick-out procedure whereby users identifying themselves as being under the age of 13 during the registration process are not allowed to register for the sites member only services, such as message boards and live chat events. Our fit.WebMD.com site is designed to comply with COPPA and we believe that that site and our other sites comply, where applicable, with the FTCs COPPA rule. 
 FACTA.    In an effort to reduce the risk of identity theft from the improper disposal of consumer information, Congress passed the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (or FACTA), which requires businesses to take reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to such information. FACTAs disposal standards are flexible and allow businesses discretion in determining what measures are reasonable based upon the sensitivity of the information, the costs and benefits of different disposal methods and relevant changes in technology. We believe that we are in compliance with FACTA. 
 Telemarketing.    The Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud Abuse Prevention Act (TCFAPA) and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) are laws that govern telemarketing and other calling activities. Both the FTC (via the Telephone Sales Rule) and the FCC have enacted rules under these statutes that implement the national do-not-call registry and which also apply to a broad range of other telephone calling activities, including as relevant to text message marketing and autodialed calls to cell phones. States also have their own telemarketing laws governing an array of telephone calling activities. We believe that we are in compliance with the TCFAPA, the TCPA, and state telemarketing laws. 
Regulation of Wellness Incentive Programs 
 Certain provisions of HIPAA (commonly referred to as the HIPAA nondiscrimination provisions) generally prohibit group health plans from charging similarly situated individuals different premiums or contributions or imposing different deductible, co-payment, or other cost-sharing requirements based on a health factor. Such differentials are, however, acceptable under the HIPAA nondiscrimination provisions if the differentials are applied through wellness programs. The Department of Labor, in coordination with the Departments of the Treasury and HHS, has issued regulations (finalized in 2013) that define wellness programs for purposes of the HIPAA nondiscrimination provisions, establishing specific requirements for wellness programs that reward participants who satisfy a standard related to a health factor (referred to as health-contingent wellness programs) and for other types of wellness programs. These requirements for health-contingent wellness programs include (1) limiting the amount of the wellness programs rewards, which the Affordable Care Act generally increased to 30% (50% for programs designed to prevent or reduce tobacco use) of the cost of coverage, (2) the wellness program being reasonably designed to promote good health and prevent disease, (3) giving those eligible to participate in the wellness program the opportunity to qualify for the reward at least once a year, (4) providing a reward that is available to all similarly situated individuals, and (5) requiring disclosure of reasonable alternative standards that must be available under the wellness program. 
 Although HIPAA and its regulations state that certain excepted benefits, including supplemental benefits, are not subject to the wellness program rules, it does not define the term similar supplemental coverage. On 
 
31

  December 7, 2007, the Department of Labor, in coordination with the Departments of the Treasury and HHS, released Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2007-04 (FAB 2007-04) in response to the development of questionable health and wellness programs that were marketed as similar supplemental coverage. FAB 2007-04 clarifies the rules for supplemental programs and provides that supplemental benefits under a wellness program cannot discriminate on the basis of a health factor. With these requirements in place, wellness programs that require individuals to meet certain health factors can no longer be considered supplemental and thus have to comply with HIPAA wellness program regulations described in the immediately preceding paragraph. According to FAB 2007-04, programs that do not meet these requirements may be subject to enforcement actions. HHS provided parallel guidance in Program Memorandum 08-01 (May 2008). 
 The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination on the basis of an employees disability or perceived disability. Among other things, it limits employers from inquiring about the disabilities of employees unless the questions are job-related and consistent with business necessity. The ADA also limits the circumstances in which an employer may require physical examinations or answers to medical inquiries. However, the ADA allows employers to conduct voluntary medical examinations and activities, including voluntary medical histories, as part of a voluntary wellness program. A wellness program is voluntary if the employer neither requires participation nor penalizes employees who do not participate. Records acquired as part of a wellness program must be kept confidential and may not be used for a discriminatory purpose. Many states and localities provide similar protections to employees. 
 The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act restricts the collection or use of genetic information for underwriting purposes, and treats the offering of incentives or disincentives for completing an HRA or participating in a wellness program as underwriting. See  Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) above. 
 We provide services related to wellness programs in connection with our WebMD Health Services platform and coaching services. See WebMD Health Services above. We believe that we are in compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to these services, to the extent they apply to us. 
 Medical Professional Regulation 
 The practice of most healthcare professions requires licensing under applicable state law, as well as under applicable national law of most European countries. In addition, the laws in some states and European countries prohibit business entities from practicing medicine, which is generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. We do not believe that we engage in the practice of medicine, and we have attempted to structure our Websites, strategic relationships and other operations to avoid violating these state licensing and professional practice laws. We do not believe that we provide professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. We employ and contract with physicians who provide only health information to consumers, and we have no intention to provide medical care or treatment. A state or other enforcement authority, however, may determine that some portion of our business violates these laws and may seek to have us discontinue those portions or subject us to penalties or licensure requirements. Any determination that we are a healthcare provider and acted improperly as a healthcare provider may result in liability to us. 
Healthcare Reform 
 Political, economic, regulatory and enforcement influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact the various healthcare entities with which we contract. In particular, we anticipate that the U.S. Executive Branch, U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs, particularly given the ongoing scrutiny regarding healthcare pricing in the U.S. generally, and prescription drug pricing specifically. Such policies could limit the prices our advertisers and sponsors charge for their healthcare-related products or services, limit the commercial opportunities of our advertisers and sponsors and/or negatively impact revenues collected by our advertisers and sponsors. We are particularly dependent on our healthcare clients, which primarily include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies, for our advertising and sponsorship revenue. Thus, it is possible that our advertisers and sponsors will face cost 
 
32

  reduction measures and reduce their expenditures or postpone expenditure decisions, including expenditures for our services, which could have material adverse effects on our business. 
 One law in particular with a significant impact on the healthcare industry is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we refer to as the Affordable Care Act), which was signed into law in March 2010. The Affordable Care Act made extensive changes to the system of healthcare insurance and benefits in the U.S. In general, the Affordable Care Act seeks to reduce healthcare costs and decrease the number of uninsured legal U.S. residents by, among other things, requiring individuals to carry, and certain employers to offer, health insurance or be subject to penalties. The Affordable Care Act also imposed new regulations on health insurers, including guaranteed coverage requirements, prohibitions on certain annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to plan members, increased restrictions on rescinding coverage, establishment of minimum medical loss ratio requirements, a requirement to cover certain preventive services on a first dollar basis, the establishment of state insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages, and greater limitations on how health insurers price certain of their products. The Affordable Care Act also contains provisions that will affect the revenues and profits of pharmaceutical and medical device companies, including new taxes on certain sales of their products. 
 Many of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that expand insurance coverage did not become effective until 2014. Some provisions do not apply to health plans that were in place when the Affordable Care Act was enacted and have not been substantially changed since. It is difficult to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices available to them under the Affordable Care Act. Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act may result in future state legislative and regulatory changes, which we are unable to predict at this time, in order for states to comply with certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities. In addition, Congress has considered various proposals to repeal some or all of the Affordable Care Act in the past several years and legislative changes to the Affordable Care Act appear likely in the 115th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration. Multiple lawsuits challenging various provisions of the Affordable Care Act are also pending in U.S. courts. 
 While we do not currently anticipate any significant adverse effects on WebMD as a direct result of the application of the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended, to our business or on our company in its capacity as an employer, we are unable to predict what the indirect impacts of the Affordable Care Act will be on WebMDs business through its effects on other healthcare industry participants, including pharmaceutical and medical device companies that are advertisers and sponsors of The WebMD Health Network and employer and health plan clients that license our WebMD Health Services platform. Healthcare industry participants may respond to the Affordable Care Act or to uncertainties created by the potential statutory and regulatory changes by reducing their expenditures or postponing expenditure decisions, including expenditures for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 However, we believe that certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act and implementing regulations that seek to reduce healthcare costs may create opportunities for WebMD, particularly with respect to our WebMD Health Services platform and related services and, more generally, with respect to our capabilities in providing health and wellness information and education. For example, the Affordable Care Act encourages use of wellness programs through grants to small employers to establish such programs, permission for employers to offer larger rewards than under prior law in the form of waivers of cost-sharing, premium discounts, or additional benefits to employees for participating in these programs and meeting certain standards, and the inclusion of wellness services and chronic disease management among the essential health benefits that certain plans are required to provide. However, we cannot yet determine the scope of the opportunities that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended, may create or what competition we may face in our efforts to pursue such opportunities.
