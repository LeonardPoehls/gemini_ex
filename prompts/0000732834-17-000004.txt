Item 1. | Business

General
We are an independent crude oil and natural gas company with properties in the North, South and East regions of the United States. The North region consists of properties north of Kansas and west of the Mississippi River and includes North Dakota Bakken, Montana Bakken, and the Red River units. The South region includes all properties south of Nebraska and west of the Mississippi River including various plays in the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province), STACK (Sooner Trend Anadarko Canadian Kingfisher), and Arkoma Woodford areas of Oklahoma. Historically, our properties in Blaine, Dewey and Custer counties of Oklahoma that produced from the Woodford formation were referred to as the Northwest Cana district, while properties often underlying the same surface acreage in those counties that produced from the Meramec and Osage formations were referred to as the STACK district. Such properties were historically combined by us and referred to as "Northwest Cana/STACK". Effective December 31, 2016, we now refer to such properties simply as "STACK". The East region is comprised of undeveloped leasehold acreage east of the Mississippi River with no current drilling or production operations. 
We were originally formed in 1967 to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and natural gas properties. Through the late 1980s, our activities and growth remained focused primarily in Oklahoma. In the late 1980s, we expanded our activity into the North region. The North region comprised approximately 61% of our crude oil and natural gas production and approximately 69% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately 50% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 are located in the North region. In recent years, we have significantly expanded our activity in our South region with our discovery of the SCOOP play and our increased activity in the STACK play. Our South region comprised approximately 39% of our crude oil and natural gas production, 31% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues, and 50% of our estimated proved reserves as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.
We focus our exploration activities in large new or developing crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas plays that provide us the opportunity to acquire undeveloped acreage positions for future drilling operations. We have been successful in targeting large repeatable resource plays where three dimensional seismic, horizontal drilling, geosteering technologies, advanced completion technologies (e.g., fracture stimulation) and enhanced recovery technologies allow us to develop and produce crude oil and natural gas reserves from unconventional formations. As a result of these efforts, we have grown substantially through the drill bit. 
As of December 31, 2016, our estimated proved reserves were 1,275 MMBoe, with estimated proved developed reserves of 519 MMBoe, or 41% of our total estimated proved reserves. Crude oil represents approximately 50% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows totaled approximately $5.5 billion at December 31, 2016.
For 2016, we generated crude oil and natural gas revenues of $2.03 billion and operating cash flows of $1.13 billion. Crude oil accounted for approximately 59% of our total production and approximately 82% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for 2016. Production averaged 216,912 Boe per day for 2016, a 2% decrease compared to average production of 221,715 Boe per day for 2015. Average daily production for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 decreased 7% to 209,861 Boe per day compared to 224,936 Boe per day for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, reflecting natural declines in production, reduced drilling and completion activities, and persistent severe winter weather in North Dakota in late 2016. 
The table below summarizes our total estimated proved reserves, PV-10 and net producing wells as of December 31, 2016, average daily production for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and the reserve-to-production index in our principal operating areas. The PV-10 values shown below are not intended to represent the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report for further discussion of uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates.

(1) | PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues of approximately $1.1 billion. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. We and others in the crude oil and natural gas industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific income tax characteristics of such entities. See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further discussion.


(2) | The Annualized Reserve/Production Index is the number of years that estimated proved reserves would last assuming current production continued at the same rate. This index is calculated by dividing annualized fourth quarter 2016 production into estimated proved reserve volumes as of December 31, 2016.

Business Environment and Outlook
Crude oil prices faced significant downward pressure in early 2016 due to domestic and global supply and demand factors, with prices dropping to $26 per barrel in February 2016, a level not seen since 2003. Natural gas prices also faced significant downward pressure in early 2016, dropping to $1.49 per MMBtu in March 2016, a level not seen since 1998. Commodity prices subsequently showed signs of stabilization and improvement in late 2016, with crude oil prices reaching $54 per barrel and natural gas prices reaching $3.80 per MMBtu in December 2016. 
Commodity prices remain volatile and unpredictable and it is uncertain whether the increase in market prices experienced in recent months will be sustained. In light of this uncertainty, our primary business strategies for 2017 will focus on: (1) high-grading investments based on rates of return and opportunities to work down our large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells and convert undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, (2) optimizing cash flows through operating efficiencies, cost reductions, and enhanced completions, (3) managing capital spending to minimize the incurrence of new debt and maintain ample liquidity and financial flexibility, and (4) further reducing debt using proceeds from potential sales of non-strategic assets.
In response to the stabilization and improvement in commodity prices in late 2016 we have increased our planned non-acquisition capital spending for 2017 to $1.95 billion compared to $1.07 billion spent in 2016. This planned investment level has been set based on an expectation of available cash flows for 2017 at an assumed average West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude oil price of $55 per barrel and an assumed average Henry Hub benchmark price of $3.14 per Mcf for the year.

As part of our planned increase in spending for 2017, we expect to increase our well completion activities and begin to work down our large year-end 2016 inventory of uncompleted wells in North Dakota. Starting in late 2015, we significantly reduced our Bakken well completion activities in response to depressed crude oil prices and shifted our focus to higher rate-of-return areas in Oklahoma that typically have higher concentrations of natural gas. As a result of this shift, our inventory of uncompleted wells in North Dakota Bakken grew to 187 gross (138 net) operated wells at December 31, 2016 and natural gas grew to become a larger portion of our total production and revenues in 2016 compared to our historical results. During 2016, we worked to test and develop the best enhanced completion methods to improve production and reserve potential. For 2017, we expect to begin realizing the value from those efforts in conjunction with our increased well completion activities. 
Approximately $550 million of our 2017 capital budget is expected to be allocated toward the completion of operated and non-operated North Dakota Bakken wells that were drilled but not completed as of year-end 2016, which is expected to reduce our operated uncompleted well inventory in that play by 131 gross (100 net) operated wells in 2017. Additionally, in 2017 we plan to spend approximately $226 million to drill 101 gross (57 net) new operated Bakken wells, of which 17 gross (8 net) wells are expected to have first production in 2017, and $264 million on new non-operated Bakken drilling. Further, in 2017 we plan to spend approximately $435 million primarily in oil-weighted areas of the STACK play and $245 million in the SCOOP play. This planned allocation of capital is expected to result in crude oil becoming a larger portion of our total production as 2017 progresses. Crude oil is projected to account for approximately 59% of our total production by year-end 2017 compared to approximately 55% in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Our increased drilling and completion activities are projected to result in an increase in our average daily production from 216,912 Boe per day for 2016 to between 220,000 and 230,000 Boe per day for 2017. Our rate of production is expected to be relatively flat through the first half of 2017 relative to year-end 2016, but is expected to accelerate in the second half of the year due to production commencing from our Bakken well completion activities. Our inventory of uncompleted wells represents significant value to Continental and our increased completion activities are expected to be a key driver of our production and cash flow growth in 2017. We plan to be disciplined, however, and may adjust our pace of development as 2017 market conditions evolve. See the section below titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects for further discussion of our 2017 plans. 
Our Business Strategy
Despite ongoing volatility and uncertainty in commodity prices, our business strategy continues to be focused on increasing shareholder value by finding and developing crude oil and natural gas reserves at costs that provide attractive rates of return. The principal elements of this strategy include:
Growing and sustaining a premier portfolio of assets focused on high rate-of-return projects. We hold a portfolio of leasehold acreage, drilling opportunities and uncompleted wells in certain premier U.S. resource plays with varying exposure to crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. We pursue opportunities to develop our existing properties as well as explore for new resource plays where significant reserves may be economically developed. Our capital programs are designed to allocate investments to projects that provide opportunities to work down our large inventory of uncompleted wells, convert our undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, and improve hydrocarbon recoveries and rates of return on capital employed. While our operations have historically focused on the exploration and development of crude oil, we also allocate significant capital to liquids-rich natural gas areas that provide attractive rates of return. 
Optimizing cash flows through operating efficiencies, cost reductions, and enhanced completions. We continue to manage through the current commodity price environment by focusing on improving operating efficiencies and reducing costs. Our key operating areas are characterized by large acreage positions in select unconventional resource plays with multiple stacked geologic formations that provide repeatable drilling opportunities and resource potential. We operate a significant portion of our wells and leasehold acreage and believe the concentration of our operated assets allows us to leverage our technical expertise and manage the development of our properties to achieve cost reductions through operating efficiencies and economies of scale. 
Building upon progress made in 2015, we continued to achieve large efficiency gains in various aspects of our business in 2016, including additional reductions in spud-to-total depth drilling times and average days to drill horizontal laterals, which led to significant reductions in drilling costs in our core areas incremental to those achieved in 2015. In addition to lowering our drilling costs, we also work to optimize cash flows through the use of enhanced completion technologies that help improve recoveries and rates of return. These efforts have had a positive impact on the efficiency of our capital deployed in recent years, resulting in significant improvement in the quantity of reserves found and developed per dollar invested. 
Maintaining financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet. Maintaining a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and financial flexibility are key components of our business strategy. In 2016, we reduced our total debt by $538 million, or 8%, from $7.12 billion at year-end 2015 to $6.58 billion at year-end 2016. For 2017, we are targeting further debt reduction using proceeds 
3

from potential sales of non-strategic assets and will continue our focus on preserving financial flexibility and ample liquidity as we manage the risks facing our industry. As we have done historically to preserve or enhance liquidity we may adjust our capital program throughout the year, divest non-strategic assets, or enter into strategic joint ventures. 
Focusing on organic growth through disciplined capital investments. Although we consider various growth opportunities, including property acquisitions, our primary focus is on organic growth through leasing and drilling in our core areas where we can exploit our extensive inventory of repeatable drilling opportunities to achieve attractive rates of return. From January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016, our proved reserve additions through organic extensions and discoveries were 943 MMBoe compared to 1 MMBoe of proved reserve acquisitions during that same period.
Our Business Strengths
We have a number of strengths we believe will help us successfully execute our business strategy, including the following:
Large Acreage Inventory. We held approximately 786,800 net undeveloped acres and 1.18 million net developed acres under lease in certain premier U.S. resource plays as of December 31, 2016. Approximately 60% of our net undeveloped acres are located within unconventional resource plays in the Bakken, SCOOP, STACK and Arkoma Woodford areas. We have developed sizable acreage positions in our core operating areas and believe the concentration of our assets allows us to achieve operating efficiencies and reduce costs through economies of scale. We are among the largest leaseholders in the Bakken, SCOOP, and STACK plays with approximately 848,500 net acres, 345,700 net acres, and 196,200 net acres under lease in those respective plays at December 31, 2016. Being an early entrant in these plays has allowed us to capture significant acreage positions in core parts of the plays. 
Expertise with Horizontal Drilling and Enhanced Completion Methods. We have substantial experience with horizontal drilling and enhanced completion methods and continue to be among the industry leaders in the use of new drilling and completion technologies. We continue to improve drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multi-well pad drilling in our operating areas. Further, we are among industry leaders in drilling long lateral lengths. Results to date indicate longer laterals have a positive impact on well productivity and economics. We have also been among industry leaders in testing enhanced completion technologies involving various combinations of fluid types, proppant types and volumes, and stimulation stage lengths to determine optimal methods for improving recoveries and rates of return. We continually refine our drilling and completion techniques in an effort to deliver improved results across our properties. 
Control Operations Over a Substantial Portion of Our Assets and Investments. As of December 31, 2016, we operated properties comprising 88% of our total proved reserves. By controlling a significant portion of our operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and completion methods used.
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive expertise in the oil and gas industry. Our Chief Executive Officer, Harold G. Hamm, began his career in the oil and gas industry in 1967. Our 10 senior officers have an average of 37 years of oil and gas industry experience.
Financial Position and Liquidity. We have a revolving credit facility with lender commitments totaling $2.75 billion which may be increased up to a total of $4.0 billion upon agreement with participating lenders to provide additional liquidity if needed to take advantage of business opportunities and fund our capital program and commitments. We had approximately $1.91 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit facility at January 31, 2017 after considering outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. We have no near-term debt maturities, with our earliest maturity being a $500 million term loan due in November 2018. 
Our revolving credit facility is unsecured and does not have a borrowing base requirement that is subject to periodic redetermination based on changes in commodity prices and proved reserves. Additionally, downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit rating do not trigger a reduction in our current revolving credit facility commitments, nor do such actions trigger a security requirement or change in covenants. Downgrades of our credit rating will, however, trigger increases in our revolving credit facility's interest rates and commitment fees paid on unused borrowing availability under certain circumstances.

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations
Proved Reserves
Proved reserves are those quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain. In connection with the estimation of proved reserves, the term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of crude oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our internal reserve engineers and Ryder Scott Company, L.P (“Ryder Scott”), our independent reserve engineers, employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps including isopach and structure maps, analogy and statistical analysis, and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data.
The following table sets forth estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves information by reserve category as of December 31, 2016. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows totaled approximately $5.5 billion at December 31, 2016. Our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2016 are based primarily on a reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. In preparing its report, Ryder Scott evaluated properties representing approximately 99% of our PV-10 and 99% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016. Our internal technical staff evaluated the remaining properties. A copy of Ryder Scott’s summary report is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our estimated proved reserves and related future net revenues, Standardized Measure and PV-10 at December 31, 2016 were determined using the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the period of January 2016 through December 2016, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were held constant throughout the lives of the properties. These prices were $42.75 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.49 per MMBtu for natural gas ($35.57 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.14 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials).

(1) | PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues of approximately $1.1 billion. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. We and others in the crude oil and natural gas industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific income tax characteristics of such entities.

Revisions of previous estimates. Revisions represent changes in previous reserve estimates, either upward or downward, resulting from new information normally obtained from development drilling and production history or resulting from a change in economic factors, such as commodity prices, operating costs, or development costs. 
The downward pressure on commodity prices experienced in recent years intensified in early 2016, with crude oil prices dropping to $26 per barrel in February 2016 and natural gas prices dropping to $1.49 per MMBtu in March 2016. Prices remained depressed for a significant portion of 2016, resulting in a decrease in the 12-month average prices used to estimate proved reserves at year-end 2016. The 12-month average price for crude oil decreased 15% from $50.28 per Bbl for 2015 to $42.75 per Bbl for 2016, while the 12-month average price for natural gas decreased 3% from $2.58 per MMBtu for 2015 to $2.49 per MMBtu for 2016. These decreases shortened the economic lives of certain producing properties and caused certain exploration and development projects to become uneconomic which had an adverse impact on our proved reserve estimates, resulting in downward reserve revisions of 20 MMBo and 50 Bcf (totaling 28 MMBoe) in 2016. 
Given the drastic decrease in commodity prices in early 2016, and given the uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of any price recovery, maintaining a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and financial flexibility has become an increasingly important component of our long-term business strategy. We significantly reduced our capital spending in 2016 to minimize the incurrence of new debt. Similarly, our 2017 capital budget has been set based on an expectation of available cash flows. 
In light of our strategy to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, we have further refined our capital program to focus on areas that provide the greatest opportunities to convert undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, achieve operating efficiencies and cost reductions through multi-well pad drilling, and improve recoveries, cash flows and rates of return using 
6

enhanced completions. As part of this effort, we shifted a significant portion of our 2016 spending away from the Bakken to areas in Oklahoma that offered more advantageous opportunities. We expect to continue allocating significant capital to Oklahoma given the drilling successes achieved to date in the STACK and SCOOP plays. This shift, a longer and more severe decrease in crude oil prices than anticipated, and our increased emphasis on balancing capital spending with cash flows have altered the timing and extent of our previous development plans in certain areas and resulted in the removal of 51 MMBo and 118 Bcf (totaling 70 MMBoe) of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be developed within five years from the date of initial booking, primarily in the Bakken. These removals do not necessarily represent the elimination of recoverable hydrocarbons physically in place. In some instances the removed reserves may be developed in the future in the event of a favorable change in commodity prices and an expansion of our capital expenditure budget. 
Additionally, changes in anticipated production performance on certain properties resulted in 37 MMBo of downward revisions to crude oil reserves and 166 Bcf of upward revisions to natural gas reserves (netting to 9 MMBoe of downward revisions) in 2016. Further, changes in ownership interests, operating costs, and other factors during the year resulted in 7 MMBo of upward revisions to crude oil reserves and 61 Bcf of downward revisions to natural gas reserves (netting to 3 MMBoe of downward revisions). 
Extensions, discoveries and other additions. These are additions to our proved reserves that result from (i) extension of the proved acreage of previously discovered reservoirs through additional drilling in periods subsequent to discovery and (ii) discovery of new fields with proved reserves or of new reservoirs of proved reserves in old fields. Extensions, discoveries and other additions for each of the three years reflected in the table above were primarily due to increases in proved reserves associated with our successful drilling activity in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK areas. Proved reserve additions from our drilling activities in the Bakken totaled 73 MMBoe, 96 MMBoe and 222 MMBoe for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, while reserve additions in SCOOP totaled 97 MMBoe, 93 MMBoe and 208 MMBoe for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, extensions and discoveries in 2016 and 2015 were significantly impacted by successful drilling results in the STACK play, resulting in proved reserve additions of 79 MMBoe in 2016 and 57 MMBoe in 2015. See the subsequent section titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects for a discussion of our 2016 drilling activities. We expect a significant portion of future reserve additions will continue to come from our major development projects in the Bakken, SCOOP, and STACK areas. 
Sales of minerals in place. These are reductions to proved reserves resulting from the disposition of properties during a period. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 14. Property Dispositions for further discussion of notable dispositions. We may continue to seek opportunities to sell non-strategic properties if and when we have the ability to dispose of such assets at favorable terms.
Purchases of minerals in place. These are additions to proved reserves resulting from the acquisition of properties during a period. We have had no significant acquisitions in the past three years. However, we may participate as a buyer of properties when and if we have the ability to increase our position in strategic plays at favorable terms.

All of our PUD reserves at December 31, 2016 are located in the SCOOP, Bakken, and STACK plays, our most active development areas, with those plays comprising 43%, 42%, and 15%, respectively, of our total PUD reserves at year-end 2016. The following table provides information regarding changes in our PUD reserves for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our PUD reserves at December 31, 2016 include 81 MMBoe of reserves associated with drilled but uncompleted wells. 
 | Crude Oil(MBbls) | | Natural Gas(MMcf) | | Total(MBoe)
Proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015 | 373,716 | | | 1,961,443 | | 700,623 | 
Revisions of previous estimates | (81,305 | ) | | (123,838 | ) | (101,945 | )
Extensions and discoveries | 80,397 | | | 757,554 | | 206,656 |

Conversion to proved developed reserves | (18,894 | ) | | (173,914 | ) | (47,879 | )
Proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2016 | 353,018 | | | 2,419,198 | | 756,218 | 

Revisions of previous estimates. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we removed 255 gross (141 net) PUD locations, which resulted in the removal of 51 MMBo and 118 Bcf (totaling 70 MMBoe) of PUD reserves, of which 47 MMBo and 75 Bcf (totaling 60 MMBoe) was related to our Bakken properties. These removals were due to the aforementioned refinement of our drilling program to place emphasis on areas that provide the greatest opportunities to convert undeveloped acreage to 
7

acreage held by production, achieve operating efficiencies and cost reductions through multi-well pad drilling, and improve recoveries, cash flows and rates of return using enhanced completions. These and other aforementioned factors altered the timing and extent of our previous development plans in certain areas and resulted in the removal of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be developed within five years of the date of initial booking. 
Additionally, decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices in 2016 caused certain exploration and development projects to become uneconomic, which resulted in downward PUD reserve revisions of 9 MMBo and 26 Bcf (totaling 13 MMBoe) in 2016. Further, changes in anticipated production performance on producing properties having offsetting PUD locations resulted in 22 MMBo of downward revisions to crude oil PUD reserves and 60 Bcf of upward revisions to natural gas PUD reserves (netting to 12 MMBoe of downward revisions) in 2016. Finally, changes in ownership interests, operating costs, and other factors during the year resulted in a net decrease in PUD reserves of 40 Bcf (7 MMBoe). 
Extensions and discoveries. Extensions and discoveries were primarily due to increases in PUD reserves associated with our successful drilling activity in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK areas. PUD reserve additions in the Bakken totaled 45 MMBo and 84 Bcf (totaling 59 MMBoe) in 2016, while SCOOP PUD reserve additions totaled 14 MMBo and 383 Bcf (totaling 78 MMBoe), and STACK PUD reserve additions totaled 21 MMBo and 290 Bcf (totaling 70 MMBoe). See the subsequent section titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects for a discussion of our 2016 drilling activities in these areas. 
Conversion to proved developed reserves. In 2016, we developed approximately 10% of our PUD locations and 7% of our PUD reserves booked as of December 31, 2015 through the drilling and completion of 192 gross (60 net) development wells at an aggregate capital cost of approximately $269 million. In 2015 and 2016, we significantly reduced our well completion activities in response to depressed crude oil prices. These actions resulted in a build up of drilled but uncompleted wells at year-end 2015 that subsequently grew in 2016, which adversely impacted our conversion of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves in 2016. Our drilled but uncompleted wells are classified as PUD reserves when relatively major expenditures are required to complete the wells. 
At December 31, 2015, we had 91 MMBoe of PUD reserves associated with 179 gross (125 net) operated uncompleted PUD locations at that date, a majority of which were not completed in 2016 and, accordingly, are not reflected as having been converted to proved developed reserves in 2016 and continue to be reflected as PUD locations at December 31, 2016. If the year-end 2015 drilled but uncompleted wells had been completed and converted to proved developed locations in 2016, our 2016 PUD reserve conversion rate of 7% would have been notably higher. 
Our inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells now totals 187 gross (138 net) operated wells in North Dakota and 43 gross (19 net) operated wells in Oklahoma at December 31, 2016. As previously noted, in 2017 we plan to increase our well completion activities and work down a significant portion of our uncompleted PUD locations. These actions are expected to have a positive impact on our PUD conversion rate in 2017. PUD reserves associated with drilled but uncompleted wells totaled 81 MMBoe at December 31, 2016, representing 11% of our total PUD reserves at that date. 
Development plans. We have acquired substantial leasehold positions in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK plays. Our drilling programs to date in those areas have focused on proving our undeveloped leasehold acreage through strategic drilling, thereby increasing the amount of leasehold acreage in the secondary term of the lease with no further drilling obligations (i.e., categorized as held by production) and resulting in a reduced amount of leasehold acreage in the primary term of the lease. While we may opportunistically drill strategic exploratory wells, the majority of our future capital expenditures will be focused on developing our PUD locations, with emphasis on drilled but not completed locations. The costs to drill our uncompleted wells were incurred prior to December 31, 2016 and only the remaining completion costs are included in future development plans. 
Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUD reserves are projected to be approximately $1.1 billion in 2017 (56% of total capital budget), $1.4 billion in 2018, $1.5 billion in 2019, $1.3 billion in 2020, and $1.0 billion in 2021. These capital expenditure projections are reflective of the current commodity price environment and have been established based on an expectation of available cash flows and borrowing capacity. Development of our existing PUD reserves at December 31, 2016, including those associated with uncompleted wells, is expected to occur within five years of the date of initial booking of the PUDs. PUD reserves not expected to be developed within five years of initial booking because of depressed commodity prices or for other reasons have been removed from our reserves at December 31, 2016. We had no PUD reserves at December 31, 2016 that remain undeveloped beyond five years from the date of initial booking.

Total wells | 365 | | 91.9 | | 897 | | 270.5 | | 1,101 | 388.5

As of December 31, 2016, there were 440 gross (198 net) operated and non-operated wells that have been spud and are in the process of drilling, completing or waiting on completion. 
For 2017, we plan to operate an average of approximately 20 drilling rigs and 11 completion crews for the year. Our drilling and completion activity for 2017 will depend on crude oil and natural gas prices and potential drilling efficiency gains and, accordingly, our rig and completion crew count may increase or decrease from planned levels. As a result of the significant decrease in commodity prices in recent years, the number of providers of materials and services has decreased in the regions where we operate. As a result, the likelihood of experiencing shortages of materials and services may be further increased in connection with any period of commodity price recovery. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, well completion crews, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis.

Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects
In the following discussion, we review our budgeted number of wells and capital expenditures for 2017 in our key operating areas. Our 2017 capital budget has been set based on an expectation of available cash flows in order to minimize the incurrence of new debt. If cash flows are materially impacted by a decline in commodity prices, we have the ability to reduce our capital expenditures or utilize the availability of our revolving credit facility if needed to fund our operations. Conversely, higher cash flows resulting from an increase in commodity prices could result in increased capital expenditures.
The following table provides information regarding well counts and 2017 budgeted capital expenditures by operating area.

North Region 
Our properties in the North region represented 50% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 and 57% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2016. Our average daily production from such properties was 118,773 Boe per day for the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 20% from the comparable 2015 period due to natural declines in production, our planned reduction in drilling and completion activities, and persistent severe winter weather in North Dakota in late 2016. Our principal producing properties in the North region are located in the Bakken field and the Red River units.
Bakken Field
The Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana is one of the premier crude oil resource plays in the United States. We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in the Bakken. As of December 31, 2016, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in the Bakken with approximately 1.4 million gross (848,500 net) acres under lease. 
Our total Bakken production averaged 104,524 Boe per day for the fourth quarter of 2016, down 23% from the 2015 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2016, total Bakken production decreased 13% over 2015. We significantly reduced our drilling and well completion activities in the Bakken in 2016 in response to depressed crude oil prices, which reduced our production volumes. In 2016, we completed 192 gross (38 net) wells in the Bakken compared to 650 gross (181 net) wells completed in 2015. Our 2016 activity in the Bakken focused on limited development of de-risked, higher rate-of-return areas in core parts of North Dakota and the testing of various enhanced completion technologies to determine optimal methods for improving crude oil recoveries and rates of return. As a result of our reduced well completion activities, our inventory of uncompleted wells in North Dakota increased from 135 gross (107 net) operated wells at year-end 2015 to 187 gross (138 net) operated wells at December 31, 2016.
Our Bakken properties represented 46% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2016 and 50% of our average daily Boe production for the 2016 fourth quarter. Our total proved Bakken field reserves as of December 31, 2016 were 592 MMBoe, which represents a decrease of 11% compared to December 31, 2015 due to reservoir production, reduced drilling, and downward reserve revisions in 2016 prompted by lower commodity prices and changes in drilling plans. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in the Bakken totaled 1,081 gross (600 net) wells as of December 31, 2016.
In response to the stabilization and improvement in commodity prices in late 2016 we plan to increase our activities in North Dakota Bakken in 2017 relative to 2016 and begin working down our large inventory of uncompleted wells. In 2017, we plan to invest approximately $1.04 billion to drill, complete and initiate production on 351 gross (143 net) operated and non-
13

operated wells in North Dakota Bakken. This includes $550 million for the completion and initiation of production on certain non-operated Bakken wells and 131 gross (100 net) operated Bakken wells that were drilled but not completed as of year-end 2016, $226 million toward the drilling of 101 gross (57 net) new operated Bakken wells, of which 17 gross (8 net) wells are expected to have first production in 2017, and $264 million on new non-operated Bakken drilling.
We plan to maintain our current level of four operated rigs in North Dakota Bakken throughout 2017. Additionally, we plan to use, on average, seven well completion crews in North Dakota Bakken throughout 2017, up from four completion crews at December 31, 2016. Our 2017 drilling and completion activities will focus on core parts of North Dakota Bakken that provide opportunities to work down our inventory of uncompleted wells, convert undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, increase capital efficiency, reduce finding and development costs, and improve rates of return. 
Red River Units
The Red River units are comprised of nine units located along the Cedar Creek Anticline in North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana that produce crude oil and natural gas from the Red River “B” formation. Our principal producing properties in the Red River units include the Cedar Hills units in North Dakota and Montana, the Medicine Pole Hills units in North Dakota, and the Buffalo Red River units in South Dakota. Our properties in the Red River units comprise a portion of the Cedar Hills field.
All combined, our Red River units and adjacent areas represented 3% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 and 5% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2016. Our average daily production from these legacy properties decreased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 due to natural declines in production and reduced drilling activity. We had limited activity in the Red River units in 2016, choosing instead to allocate capital to areas in North Dakota Bakken and Oklahoma that generate more attractive rates of return. For 2017, we plan to invest approximately $26 million in the Red River units primarily on well workover activities aimed at enhancing production and recoveries for these legacy properties. 
South Region
Our properties in the South region represented 50% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 and 43% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the 2016 fourth quarter, our average daily production from such properties was 91,088 Boe per day, an increase of 20% from the comparable period in 2015. Our principal producing properties in the South region are located in the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma. 
Historically, our properties in Blaine, Dewey and Custer counties of Oklahoma that produced from the Woodford formation were referred to as the Northwest Cana district, while properties often underlying the same surface acreage in those counties that produced from the Meramec and Osage formations were referred to as the STACK district. Such properties were historically combined by us and referred to as "Northwest Cana/STACK". Effective December 31, 2016, we now refer to such properties simply as "STACK". 
SCOOP
The SCOOP play currently extends across Garvin, Grady, Stephens, Carter, McClain and Love counties in Oklahoma and contains crude oil and condensate-rich fairways as delineated by numerous industry wells. We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in the SCOOP play. As of December 31, 2016, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in SCOOP with approximately 617,700 gross (345,700 net) acres under lease. 
Our SCOOP leasehold has the potential to contain hydrocarbons from a variety of conventional and unconventional reservoirs overlying and underlying the Woodford formation in Oklahoma. In recent years, our drilling activities have resulted in the vertical expansion of our SCOOP Woodford position and discovery of the SCOOP Springer formation, which is located approximately 1,000 to 1,500 feet above the Woodford formation. Located in the heart of our SCOOP acreage, our Springer position supplements our Woodford leasehold and expands our resource potential and inventory in the play. 
Our 2016 drilling activity in SCOOP focused on continued development of de-risked, higher rate-of-return areas in core parts of the play. Additionally, in 2016 we continued to improve upon our enhanced completion designs by testing various combinations of fluid types, proppant types and volumes, and stimulation stage lengths to determine optimal methods for improving recoveries and rates of return. Notably, in 2016 we completed our first enhanced completion density test in the SCOOP Woodford oil window at the seven-well May unit. Enhanced completion designs utilized at the May unit resulted in initial production rates that outperformed offsetting wells. Results from the test were encouraging for the future development of our SCOOP Woodford properties. 
14

SCOOP represented 37% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 and 30% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2016. Production in SCOOP decreased to an average rate of 63,490 Boe per day during the fourth quarter of 2016, down 2% compared to the 2015 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2016, SCOOP production grew 6% over 2015. We completed 72 gross (28 net) wells in SCOOP during 2016. Proved reserves increased 14% year-over-year to 472 MMBoe as of December 31, 2016, of which 32% represents proved developed reserves. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in SCOOP as of December 31, 2016 totaled 370 gross (250 net) wells.
In 2017, we plan to invest approximately $245 million to drill, complete and initiate production on 108 gross (24 net) operated and non-operated wells in the SCOOP play. We plan to average approximately five operated rigs and one completion crew in SCOOP throughout 2017, consistent with our current activity levels. Our 2017 drilling program will continue to focus on expanding the known productive extents of the SCOOP Woodford and SCOOP Springer formations and de-risking our acreage, while focusing on areas that provide opportunities for converting undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, increasing capital efficiency, reducing finding and development costs, and maximizing rates of return. 
STACK
STACK, an acronym for Sooner Trend Anadarko Canadian Kingfisher, is a significant new resource play located in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma characterized by stacked geologic formations with major targets in the Meramec, Osage and Woodford formations. As of December 31, 2016, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in STACK with approximately 353,800 gross (196,200 net) acres under lease. A significant portion of our STACK acreage is located in over-pressured portions of Blaine, Dewey and Custer counties of Oklahoma where we believe the reservoirs are typically thicker and deliver superior production rates relative to normal-pressured areas of the STACK petroleum system. 
We completed our first STACK well in mid-2015. Building on early success achieved from our initial 2015 drilling activities, we significantly increased our leasing and drilling activities in the STACK in 2016. Our 2016 activities focused on expanding our understanding of the productive extents and hydrocarbon content of the play both vertically and horizontally and working to establish optimum well spacing and enhanced completion methods for future field development. 
To help accelerate our understanding of the resource potential of STACK, in 2016 we drilled our first density pilot in the over-pressured oil window of the play at our eight-well Ludwig unit. Results from the Ludwig unit were very encouraging and demonstrated consistency of production and the significant potential value of our leasehold in STACK. The Ludwig results helped to de-risk a portion of our acreage and provided validation to increase our development activities in the play. 
Since the completion of our first STACK well in mid-2015 we have successfully tested productive zones in the play, applied enhanced completions to improve recoveries, demonstrated repeatability of results, reduced drilling times, reduced well costs, and de-risked a sizeable portion of our acreage in the play. Due to the success of these efforts, STACK has become another significant growth platform for us and is expected to be an important contributor to our long-term growth. To facilitate the future development of our STACK acreage, we are in the process of increasing our water recycling and distribution capabilities in the play. Additionally, we are increasing our gathering and takeaway capabilities to handle crude oil and natural gas production expected from development of the play. 
Our STACK properties represented 13% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 and 12% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2016. Production in STACK increased to an average rate of 24,426 Boe per day during the fourth quarter of 2016, up 217% over the 2015 fourth quarter due to additional drilling and completion activity resulting from our drilling program. For the year ended December 31, 2016, STACK production grew 206% over 2015. We completed a total of 97 gross (26 net) wells in STACK during 2016. Proved reserves totaled 161 MMBoe as of December 31, 2016, of which 28% represents proved developed reserves. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations stood at 264 gross (113 net) wells as of December 31, 2016.
In 2017, we plan to invest approximately $435 million to drill, complete and initiate production on 157 gross (51 net) operated and non-operated wells in STACK. We plan to average approximately 11 operated rigs in STACK throughout 2017, consistent with our current activity level. Additionally, we plan to use, on average, three completion crews in STACK throughout 2017, up from two crews in 2016. Our 2017 activities will focus on delineating and de-risking our acreage, expanding the known productive extents of the play through the completion of new density test projects, monitoring production from enhanced completions, and continued refinement of our geologic and economic models in the area.

Title to Properties
As is customary in the crude oil and natural gas industry, upon initiation of acquiring oil and gas leases covering fee mineral interests on undeveloped lands which do not have associated proved reserves, contract landmen conduct a title examination of courthouse records to determine fee mineral ownership. Such title examinations, lease form, and final terms are reviewed and approved by Company landmen prior to consummation. 
17

For acquisitions from third parties, whether lands are producing crude oil and natural gas or non-producing, Company and contract landmen perform title examinations at applicable courthouses, obtain a physical well site inspection, and examine the seller's internal land, legal, operational, environmental, well, marketing and accounting records upon execution of a mutually acceptable purchase and sale agreement. We may also procure an acquisition title opinion from outside legal counsel on higher value properties. 
Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, we procure an original title opinion, or supplement an existing title opinion, from outside legal counsel and perform curative work to satisfy requirements pertaining to material title defects, if any. We will not commence drilling operations until we have cured material title defects pertaining to the Company's interest. 
We have procured title opinions and cured material defects as to Company interests on substantially all of our producing properties and believe we have defensible title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Our crude oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and leasehold burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of the properties or affect our carrying value of such properties.
Marketing and Major Customers
Most of our crude oil production is sold to either crude oil refining companies or midstream marketing companies at major market centers. Other production not sold at major market centers is sold at the lease. In the Bakken and SCOOP areas we have significant production directly connected to pipeline gathering systems, with the remaining balance of production primarily being transported by truck. Additionally in the Bakken, a portion of our production is sold onto rail delivery systems. Where directly marketed crude oil is transported by truck, it is delivered to a point on a pipeline system for further delivery, or is delivered directly to a refinery. Where crude oil is sold at the lease the sale is complete at that point. 
The majority of our natural gas production is sold at our lease locations to midstream purchasers under term contracts. These contracts include multi-year term agreements, many with acreage dedication. Some of our contracts allow us the flexibility to accept, as partial payment for our sale of gas in the field, an “in-kind” volume of processed gas at the tailgate of the midstream purchaser’s processing plant. When we elect to do so, we transport this processed gas to a downstream market where it is sold. Sales at these downstream markets are mostly under monthly interruptible packaged volume deals, short term seasonal packages, and long term multi-year contracts. We continue to develop relationships and have the potential to enter into additional contracts with end-use customers, including utilities, industrial users, and liquefied natural gas exporters, for sale of gas we elect to take in-kind in lieu of cash for our leasehold sales.
Our marketing of crude oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted. For a description of some of these factors, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk factors—Our business depends on crude oil and natural gas transportation, processing and refining facilities, most of which are owned by third parties, and on the availability of rail transportation.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to Phillips 66 Company accounted for approximately 18% of our total crude oil and natural gas revenues. No other purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our total crude oil and natural gas revenues for 2016. We believe the loss of any single purchaser would not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers in various regions.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing crude oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Our competitors vary within the regions in which we operate, and some of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions economically in a highly competitive environment. In addition, as a result of the significant decrease in commodity prices in recent years, the number of providers of materials and services has decreased in the regions where we operate. As a result, the likelihood of experiencing competition and shortages of materials and services may be further increased in connection with any period of commodity price recovery.

Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry
Our operations are conducted onshore almost entirely in the United States. The crude oil and natural gas industry in the United States is subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Laws, rules, regulations, policies, and interpretations affecting our industry have been and are pervasive with the imposition of new or increased requirements on us and other industry participants. These laws, regulations and other requirements often carry substantial penalties for failure to comply and may have a significant effect on the exploration, development, production or sale of crude oil and natural gas and increase the cost of doing business and affect profitability. In addition, because public policy changes affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are commonplace and because laws, rules and regulations may be enacted, amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws, rules and regulations. We do not expect any future legislative or regulatory initiatives will affect us in a manner materially different than they would affect our similarly situated competitors.
The following is a discussion of significant laws, rules and regulations that may affect us in the areas in which we operate.
Regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids
Sales of crude oil and natural gas liquids ("NGLs") or condensate in the United States are not currently subject to price controls and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, the U.S. Congress could enact price controls in the future. Since the 1970s, the United States has regulated the exportation of petroleum and petroleum products, which restricted the markets for these commodities and affected sales prices. However, in December 2015 the U.S. Congress passed a legislative bill eliminating the export restrictions beginning in January 2016. 
With regard to our physical sales of crude oil and any derivative instruments relating to crude oil, we are required to comply with anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). See the discussion below of “Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry—FTC and CFTC Market Manipulation Rules.” If we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial penalties and related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The transportation of crude oil and NGLs, as well as other liquid products, is subject to rate and access regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates interstate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. In general, pipeline rates must be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. Oil and other liquid pipeline rates are often cost-based, although many pipeline charges today are based on historical rates adjusted for inflation and other factors, and other charges may result from settlement rates agreed to by all shippers or market-based rates, which are permitted in certain circumstances. FERC or interested persons may challenge existing or changed rates or services. Intrastate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates may be subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate crude oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. As the interstate and intrastate transportation rates we pay are generally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe the regulation of intrastate transportation rates will not affect us in a way that materially differs from the effect on our similarly situated competitors.
Further, interstate pipelines and intrastate common carrier pipelines must provide service on an equitable basis and offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When such pipelines operate at full capacity we are subject to proration provisions, which are severally described in the pipelines’ published tariffs. We believe we generally will have access to crude oil pipeline transportation services to the same extent as our similarly situated competitors.
We transport operated crude oil production from our North region to market centers using primarily a combination of rail and pipeline transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties. Approximately 8% of such production was shipped by rail in December 2016, with the remainder being shipped primarily by pipeline. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s (“U.S. DOT”) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) establishes safety regulations relating to transportation of crude oil by rail and pipeline. Third party rail operators are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board of the U.S. DOT, the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal regulatory agencies. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and regulate movement of hazardous materials if not preempted by federal law.
In 2008, the U.S. Congress passed the Rail Safety and Improvement Act, which implemented regulations governing different areas related to railroad safety. Subsequently, the FRA and PHMSA have taken several actions related to the transport of crude 
19

oil, including but not limited to: issuing an order requiring testing, classification and handling of crude oil as a hazardous material; requiring expanded hazardous material route planning for railroads to avoid populated and other sensitive areas; issuing safety advisories, alerts, emergency orders and regulatory updates; conducting special unannounced inspections; moving forward with rulemaking to enhance tank car standards for certain trains carrying crude oil and ethanol; and reaching agreement with the railroad industry on a series of voluntary actions it can take to improve safety. Notably, in May 2014 the U.S. DOT issued an order requiring all railroads operating trains containing large amounts of Bakken crude oil to notify state emergency response commissions about the operation of such trains through their states. The order requires each railroad operating trains containing more than 1,000,000 gallons of Bakken crude oil, or approximately 35 tank cars, in a particular state to provide the state with notification regarding the volumes of Bakken crude oil being transported, frequencies of anticipated train traffic and the route through which Bakken crude oil will be transported.  Also in May 2014, the FRA and PHMSA issued a safety advisory to the rail industry strongly recommending the use of tank cars with the highest level of integrity in their fleet when transporting Bakken crude oil. In May 2015, PHMSA issued a final rule which requires, among other things, enhanced tank car standards for new and existing tank cars, a classification and testing program for crude oil, and a requirement that older DOT-111 tank cars be retrofitted to comply with new tank car design standards in accordance with a specified timeline beginning in May 2017. More recently, in August 2016, PHMSA released a final rule mandating a phase-out schedule for all DOT-111 tank cars used to transport Class 3 flammable liquids between 2018 and 2029. Separately, in July 2016, PHMSA proposed a new rule that would expand the applicability of comprehensive oil spill response plans so that any railroad that transports a single train carrying 20 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil in a continuous block or a single train carrying 35 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil throughout the train must have a current, comprehensive, written plan.
We do not own or operate rail transportation facilities or rail cars; however, regulations that impact the testing or rail transportation of crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at market centers throughout the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are unable to estimate the potential impact on our business associated with new federal or state rail transportation regulations; however, at this time we do not expect such regulations will have a material impact on us nor will they affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated competitors.
With respect to transportation of crude oil by pipelines, in June 2016, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act ("PIPES Act") was signed into law, which strengthens PHMSA's safety authority and includes provisions on advancing the safe transportation of energy commodities and other hazardous materials. The PIPES Act includes provisions aimed at increasing inspection requirements for certain underwater crude oil pipelines; improving protection of coastal areas by designating them as environmentally sensitive to pipeline failures; setting minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities, and promoting better use of data and technology to prevent damage and improve safety of pipeline systems, among other things. We are unable to estimate the potential impact on our business associated with the PIPES Act regulations; however, we do not expect such regulations will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated competitors.
Pipeline regulation at the state level continues as well. For example, in December 2014 the North Dakota Industrial Commission ("NDIC") introduced rules designed to reduce the potential flammability of crude oil produced from the Bakken petroleum system (the Bakken, Three Forks, and Sanish Pool formations) before it is loaded on railcars and transported. The rules, which became effective in April 2015, outline a series of standards for pressure and temperature for production facilities to follow in order to separate certain liquids and gases from the crude oil prior to transport. While these rules could increase the cost of doing business in North Dakota, we do not expect the rules will have a material impact on us nor will they affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors. 
Regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas
In 1989, the U.S. Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas. The FERC, which has the authority under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) to regulate prices, terms, and conditions for the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce, has issued blanket authorizations for all gas resellers subject to FERC regulation, except interstate pipelines, to resell natural gas at market prices. However, either the U.S. Congress or the FERC (with respect to the resale of gas in interstate commerce) could re-impose price controls in the future. The U.S. Department of Energy (“U.S. DOE”) regulates the terms and conditions for the exportation and importation of natural gas (including liquefied natural gas or “LNG”). U.S. law provides for very limited regulation of exports to and imports from any country that has entered into a Free Trade Agreement (“FTA”) with the United States providing for national treatment of trade in natural gas; however, the U.S. DOE’s regulation of imports and exports from and to countries without an FTA is more comprehensive. The FERC also regulates the construction and operation of import and export facilities, including LNG terminals. Regulation of imports and exports and related facilities may materially affect natural gas markets and sales prices.
20

The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions under the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”), which affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has stated open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework to put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. The FERC has issued a series of orders to implement its open access policies. As a result, the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage services on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although the FERC’s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. We cannot provide any assurance the pro-competitive regulatory approach established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe any action taken by FERC will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated natural gas producers.
With regard to our physical sales of natural gas and derivative instruments relating to natural gas, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and the CFTC. See the discussion below of “Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry—FTC and CFTC Market Manipulation Rules.” If we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial penalties and related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. In addition, pursuant to various FERC orders, we may be required to submit reports to the FERC for some of our operations. See the discussion below of “Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry—FERC Market Transparency and Reporting Rules.”
Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is generally regulated by the states. Although its policies on gathering systems have varied in the past, the FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of moving natural gas to point of sale locations. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, equitable take requirements. Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels in the future. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes may have on us, but the natural gas industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes, including changes in the interpretation of existing requirements or programs to implement those requirements. We do not believe we would be affected by any such regulatory changes in a materially different way than our similarly situated competitors.
Intrastate natural gas transportation service is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers on a comparable basis, we believe the regulation of intrastate natural gas transportation in states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors.
Regulation of production
The production of crude oil and natural gas is regulated by a wide range of federal, state and local statutes, rules, orders and regulations, which require, among other matters, permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Each of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, the plugging and abandonment of wells, and limitations or prohibitions on the venting or flaring of natural gas. These regulations limit the amount of crude oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells and locations we can drill. Although we can and do apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production, severance or excise tax on the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our similarly situated competitors are generally subject to the same statutes, regulatory requirements and restrictions.

Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted into law. The Dodd-Frank Act established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC, and other regulators to establish rules and regulations to implement the new legislation. Although the CFTC has issued final regulations to implement significant aspects of the legislation, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.
In November 2013 and December 2016, the CFTC proposed rules establishing position limits with respect to certain futures and option contracts and equivalent swaps, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of these provisions on us is uncertain at this time.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, absent an exception, mandatory clearing is now required for all market participants. The CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing. The CFTC has not yet required the clearing of any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, and the trade execution requirement does not apply to swaps not subject to a clearing mandate. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the clearing requirement for our swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, along with changes to the markets for swaps as a result of the trade execution requirement, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, or if the cost of entering into uncleared swaps becomes prohibitive, we may be required to clear such transactions or execute them on a derivatives contract market or swap execution facility. The ultimate effect of the proposed rules and any additional regulations on our business is uncertain.
In December 2015, the CFTC issued final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps for swap dealers and major swap participants. The final rules do not impose margin requirements on commercial end users. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the margin requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, the posting of collateral could reduce our liquidity and cash available for capital expenditures and could reduce our ability to manage commodity price volatility and the volatility in our cash flows. 
In addition to the CFTC’s swap regulations, certain foreign jurisdictions are in the process of adopting or implementing laws and regulations relating to transactions in derivatives, including margin and central clearing requirements, which in each case may affect our counterparties and the derivatives markets generally. Other rules, including the restrictions on proprietary trading adopted under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, also known as the Volcker Rule, may alter the business practices of some of our counterparties and in some cases may cause them to stop transacting in or making markets in derivatives. Moreover, federal banking regulators are reevaluating the authorization under which banking entities subject to their authority may engage in physical commodities transactions.
Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these rulemakings, they could result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of derivative instruments we use to manage our financial and commercial risks related to fluctuations in commodity prices. Additional effects of the new regulations, including increased regulatory reporting and recordkeeping costs, increased regulatory capital requirements for our counterparties, and market dislocations or disruptions could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.
Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”) included a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and made significant changes to the statutory framework affecting the energy industry. For example, EPAct 2005 amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision making it unlawful for any entity to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. In January 2006 the FERC issued rules implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of EPAct 2005. These anti-market manipulation rules apply to natural gas pipelines and storage companies which provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” natural gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements described further below. The EPAct 2005 also provides the FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day per violation for violations of the NGA and NGPA and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. 
FERC Market Transparency and Reporting Rules. The FERC requires wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may 
22

contribute to the formation of price indices. The FERC also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with the FERC’s policy statement on price reporting. Failure to comply with these reporting requirements could subject us to enhanced civil penalty liability under the EPAct 2005.
FTC and CFTC Market Manipulation Rules. Wholesale sales of petroleum are subject to provisions of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (“EISA”) and regulations by the FTC. Under the EISA, the FTC issued its Petroleum Market Manipulation Rule (the “Rule”), which became effective in November 2009. The Rule prohibits fraudulent or deceptive conduct (including false or misleading statements of material fact) in connection with wholesale purchases or sales of crude oil or refined petroleum products. Under the EISA, the FTC has authority to request a court to impose fines of up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. The CFTC has also adopted anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit, among other things, fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. The CFTC may assess fines of up to the greater of $1,000,000 or triple the monetary gain for violations of these anti-market manipulation regulations. Knowing or willful violations of the Commodity Exchange Act is also a felony.
Additional proposals and proceedings potentially affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are pending before the U.S. Congress, the FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact these or the above laws and regulations may have on our crude oil and natural gas operations. We do not believe we will be affected in a materially different way than our similarly situated competitors.
Environmental regulation
General. We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations governing environmental compliance, including the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws, rules and regulations may, among other things:

• | require the acquisition of various permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with crude oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities;


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas including areas containing endangered species of plants and animals;


• | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; and


• | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations.

These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production below a rate otherwise possible. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additionally, the U.S. Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws, rules and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal, cleanup and remediation requirements for the crude oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
Environmental protection and natural gas flaring. We strive to operate in accordance with all applicable regulatory and legal requirements and have focused on continuously improving our environmental performance; however, at times circumstances may arise that adversely affect our compliance with applicable environmental requirements. We have established internal policies, procedures and processes regarding environmental matters for all employees, contractors, and vendors. In connection with our environmental initiatives, we work to identify and manage our environmental risks and the impact of our operations and continually improve our environmental compliance. However, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will always be successful.
One of our environmental initiatives is the reduction of air emissions produced from our operations, particularly with respect to the flaring of natural gas from our operated well sites in the Bakken field of North Dakota. North Dakota statutes permit flaring of natural gas from a well that has not been connected to a gas gathering line for a period of one year from the date of a well's first production. After one year, a producer is required to cap the well, connect it to a gas gathering line, find acceptable alternative uses for a percentage of the flared gas, or apply to the NDIC for a written exemption for any future flaring; otherwise, the producer is required to pay royalties and production taxes based on the volume and value of the gas flared from the unconnected well. While the NDIC ultimately determines the volume and value of any such gas flared and the applicable royalties and production taxes, the NDIC has thus far generally accepted our methods for calculating these figures. Furthermore, the NDIC has generally accepted applications we have submitted to secure exemptions from the post-year flaring restrictions. Finally, NDIC rules for new drilling permit applications also require the submission of gas capture plans addressing measures taken by operators to capture and not flare produced gas, regardless of whether it has been or will be 
23

connected within the first year of production. Thus far, the NDIC has generally accepted our gas capture plans submitted with applications for drilling permits. The deadline to comply with the requirement to capture 85% of the natural gas produced from a field was November 1, 2016 and the target capture percentage increases to 90% beginning October 1, 2020. Compliance with the NDIC's flaring requirements or the imposition of any additional limitations on flaring could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we delivered approximately 91% of our operated natural gas production in the North Dakota Bakken field to market, flaring approximately 9% compared to 13% in 2015 and 13% in 2014. According to data published by the NDIC, our industry as a whole flared approximately 10% of produced natural gas volumes in the North Dakota Bakken field during 2016. We are a participant in the NDIC’s Flaring Reduction Task Force and are engaged in working with other task force members and the NDIC to develop action plans for mitigating natural gas flaring in the state. Flared natural gas volumes from our operated SCOOP and STACK properties in Oklahoma are negligible given the existence of established natural gas transportation infrastructure.
There are environmental and financial risks associated with natural gas flaring and we attempt to manage these risks on an ongoing basis. To date, we have taken numerous actions to reduce flaring from our operated well sites. We make efforts to coordinate our well completion operations to coincide with well connections to gathering systems in order to minimize flaring, but may not always be successful in these efforts. Our ultimate goal is to reduce natural gas flaring from our operated well sites as much as is practicable. For example, in operating areas such as the Buffalo Red River units in South Dakota, the quality of the natural gas is not adequate to meet requirements for sale, so we employ processes to efficiently combust the gas in an effort to minimize impacts to the environment. Our levels of flaring are and will be dependent upon external factors such as investment from third parties in the development of gas gathering systems, state regulations, and the granting of reasonable right-of-way access by land owners.
We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, capital and other expenditures related to environmental compliance. Such expenditures are included within our overall capital and operating budgets and are not separately itemized. Although we believe our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, we cannot assure you the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Environmental laws, rules and regulations. Some of the existing environmental rules and regulations to which we are subject include, among others: (i) regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; (ii) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and analogous state laws that may require the removal of previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), the cleanup of property contamination (including groundwater contamination), and remedial lease restoration activities to prevent future contamination from prior operations; (iii) federal Department of Transportation safety laws and comparable state and local requirements; (iv) the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements, which establish pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations; (v) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States; (vi) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws which impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil and other substances generated by our operations, into waters of the United States or state waters; (vii) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which is a principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and comparable state statutes; (viii) the Safe Drinking Water Act and analogous state laws which impose requirements relating to our underground injection activities; (ix) the National Environmental Policy Act and comparable state statutes, which require government agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment; (x) the Endangered Species Act and comparable state statutes, which afford protections to certain plant and animal species; (xi) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which imposes certain restrictions for the protection of migratory birds; (xii) the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, which imposes certain restrictions for the protection of bald and golden eagles; (xiii) the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and comparable state statutes, which require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials stored, used or produced in our operations, and (xiv) state regulations and statutes governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations, and potential litigation.
Air emissions and climate change. Federal, state and local laws and regulations have been and may be enacted to address concerns about the effects the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other identified “greenhouse gases” may have on the environment and climate worldwide, generally referred to as “climate change.” For example, in October 2015 the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary 
24

and secondary standards. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. The EPA has also adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act establishing, among other things, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Moreover, EPA’s source determination rule, which was finalized in June 2016, specifies that oil and gas production facilities are considered to be “adjacent” (and therefore aggregated for air permitting purposes) if they are on the same site or on sites that share equipment and are within ¼ mile of each other. This rule increases the potential for individual well facilities to be viewed collectively by EPA as a single, large stationary source and, therefore, subject to PSD and/or Title V. Although we currently do not have any facilities required to adhere to PSD or Title V permit requirements, a change in our operational approach—in light of EPA’s source determination rule—could trigger Title V and/or PSD requirements for a multi-well pad facility with substantial production or centralized production facilities. EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. 
In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. New Source Performance Standard (“NSPS”) Subpart OOOO (“Quad O”), which was first promulgated in 2012, requires, among other things, the reduction of volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from three subcategories of fractured and refractured oil and gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted: wildcat (exploratory) and delineation gas wells; low reservoir pressure non-wildcat and non-delineation gas wells; and all “other” fractured and refractured oil and gas wells. All three subcategories of wells must route flowback emissions to a gathering line or be captured and combusted using a combustion device such as a flare. However, the “other” fractured and refractured wells must use reduced emission completions or “green completions.” The rule also established specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. The rule is designed to limit emissions of VOCs, sulfur dioxide, and hazardous air pollutants from a variety of sources within natural gas processing plants, oil and natural gas production facilities, and natural gas transmission compressor stations. We have modified our operations and well equipment as needed to comply with these rules. Ongoing compliance with the rules is not expected to affect us in a way materially different from our similarly situated competitors. 
In addition, in June 2016, the EPA finalized new regulations (NSPS Subpart OOOOa, commonly referred to as “Quad Oa”) setting methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities in an effort to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45% from 2012 levels by 2025 even though there was consensus at the time that oil and gas producers’ compliance with Quad O had already achieved reductions in methane emissions. 
In addition, in November 2016 EPA issued an industry wide Information Collection Request (“ICR”) pursuant to Section 114 of the Clean Air Act seeking information to help the agency determine how best to reduce methane and other emissions from existing sources in the oil and gas industry. This action is typically viewed as a precursor to a future new regulation which, if promulgated, would have the potential to impact our operating costs for existing facilities. Unlike Quad Oa, which only applies to wells constructed, reconstructed or modified after September 18, 2015, any such new ICR-related EPA regulation could target emissions from existing sources of oil and gas; however, future action by EPA with respect to methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources is uncertain at this time.
Additional regulation with respect to methane emissions occurred in November 2016, when the U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") published a final rule commonly referred to as the “BLM venting and flaring rule.” Similar to Quad Oa, the BLM venting and flaring rule imposes requirements related to methane emissions from crude oil and natural gas sources. However, the U.S. Congress has introduced a resolution seeking to repeal the BLM methane rule under the Congressional Review Act and future implementation of the BLM methane rule is uncertain. To the extent new methane emission regulations—whether it is the BLM venting and flaring rule or a prospective EPA rule targeting methane emissions from existing sources—impose reporting obligations on, or limit emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations they could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions associated with our operations, but the impact of these measures is not expected to be material and will not affect us in a materially different way from our similarly situated competitors.
At an international level, in December 2015, a global climate agreement was reached in Paris at the 21st Conference of Parties organized by the United Nations under the Framework Convention on Climate Change. The agreement, which goes into effect in 2020, resulted in nearly 200 countries, including the United States, committing to work towards limiting global warming and agreeing to a monitoring and review process of greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement includes binding and non-binding elements and did not require ratification by the U.S. Congress. Nonetheless, the agreement may result in increased political 
25

pressure on the United States to ensure continued compliance with enforcement measures under the Clean Air Act and may spur further initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the future.
While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged aimed at tracking and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those greenhouse gases. There has also been discussion of imposing a federal carbon tax on all fossil fuel production. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how such legislation or new regulations adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions will impact our business, any future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. In addition, substantial limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect the demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. Finally, some scientists have concluded increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes having significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects from such causes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.
Both the EPA and the state of North Dakota pursued enforcement actions in 2016 against operators related to emissions generally and alleged noncompliance with the requirements of Quad O, Quad Oa, and relevant state regulations more specifically. One such enforcement action by EPA against an operator resulted in a consent decree between the parties that, if finalized by the federal district court in North Dakota, will require the operator to incur costs associated with a civil penalty, emissions-related mitigation projects, and implementation of a robust leak detection and repair program applicable to all of the operator’s wells in North Dakota. Similarly, the North Dakota Department of Health (“NDDH”), the department which administers state and federal environmental laws and regulations in North Dakota, sought in 2016 to have all operators in North Dakota voluntarily sign a “global consent decree” to resolve certain NDDH allegations that historic emissions by such operators constituted violations of state and federal laws and regulations. We did not sign the proposed NDDH global consent decree and it is not clear whether NDDH will continue to pursue the global consent decree in 2017. Finally, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) announced in 2016 it had partnered with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to pursue a “Worker Endangerment Initiative” seeking to promote worker safety by pursuing not only worker safety claims in connection with worker safety incidents but also environmental claims. DOJ believes criminal penalties in the worker safety laws are inadequate, so it has begun citing companies for violations of the endangerment provisions of the three major environmental statutes, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, in connection with its prosecution of companies for workplace safety incidents. In worker safety incidents at oil and gas production facilities, DOJ has threatened to allege emissions or other environmental-related claims caused or contributed to the worker safety incident.
Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production. In recent years there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies and to induce seismic events. As a result, several federal and state agencies are studying the environmental risks with respect to hydraulic fracturing, and proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. 
At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 related to such activities. In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. To date, no other action has been taken. In June 2016 EPA finalized a regulation under the Clean Water Act prohibiting discharges to publicly owned treatment works of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities. It has not been our practice to discharge wastewater to publicly owned treatment works, so the impact of this new regulation on us is not expected to be material. 
Finally, in December 2016 EPA published a final study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on water resources. In its final report, the EPA indicated it found evidence hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. The report identified certain conditions where impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities can potentially be more frequent or severe. These include water withdrawals for hydraulic fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; spills during the handling of hydraulic fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water resulting in large volumes or high concentrations of chemicals reaching groundwater resources; injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity thereby allowing gases or liquids to move to groundwater resources; injection of 
26

hydraulic fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated hydraulic fracturing wastewater to surface water, and disposal or storage of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in unlined pits thereby resulting in contamination of groundwater resources. In its final report, the EPA indicated it was not able to calculate or estimate the national frequency of impacts on drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing activities or fully characterize the severity of impacts. Nonetheless, the results of the EPA's study or similar governmental reviews could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. 
In March 2015, the BLM issued final rules related to the regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. Several parties challenged the regulations and the U.S. District Court of Wyoming temporarily stayed implementation of the regulations. In June 2016, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming ruled the BLM lacked the statutory authority to promulgate the regulations. The U.S. Department of Interior appealed the decision and the timing of resolution is uncertain. As of December 31, 2016, we held approximately 72,900 net undeveloped acres on federal land, representing approximately 9% of our total net undeveloped acres. 
At the state level, several states, including states in which we operate, have adopted or are considering adopting legal requirements imposing more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating or prohibiting the time, place and manner of drilling activities or hydraulic fracturing activities. In certain areas of the United States, new drilling permits for hydraulic fracturing have been put on hold pending development of additional standards.
Regulators in some states, including states in which we operate, are considering additional requirements related to seismicity and its potential association with hydraulic fracturing. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (the “OCC”) recently promulgated guidance for operators of crude oil and gas wells in certain seismically-active areas of the SCOOP and STACK plays in Oklahoma. This guidance provides for seismic monitoring by the OCC and for operators to temporarily suspend operations (for six hours or in limited circumstances, a longer period of time) when the OCC has been notified of then concurrent seismic events within a 1.25-mile radius of their operations of a magnitude exceeding 2.5 on the Richter scale. If seismic events exceeding this threshold were to occur near our active stimulation operations on a frequent basis, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
We voluntarily participate in FracFocus, a national publicly accessible Internet-based registry developed by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. This registry, located at www.fracfocus.org, provides our industry with an avenue to voluntarily disclose additives used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The additives used in the hydraulic fracturing process on all wells we operate are disclosed on that website.
The adoption of any future federal, state or local laws, rules or implementing regulations imposing permitting or reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, hydraulic fracturing processes in areas in which we operate could make it more difficult and expensive to complete crude oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations, increase our costs of compliance and doing business, and delay, prevent or prohibit the development of natural resources from unconventional formations. Compliance, or the consequences of our failure to comply, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business if such federal or state legislation is enacted into law.
Waste water disposal. Underground injection wells are a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. In response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity. Some states, including states in which we operate, have delayed permit approvals, mandated a reduction in injection volumes, or have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of injection wells. Regulators in some states, including states in which we operate, are considering additional requirements related to seismicity. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OCC”) has adopted rules for operators of saltwater disposal wells in certain seismically-active areas in the Arbuckle formation of Oklahoma. These rules require, among other things, that disposal well operators conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells’ respective depths that, depending on the depth, could require plugging the well and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. Oklahoma has adopted a “traffic light” system, wherein the OCC reviews new or existing disposal wells for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted. At the federal level, the EPA's current regulatory requirements for such wells do not require the consideration of seismic impacts when issuing permits. We cannot predict the EPA's future actions in this regard. The introduction of new environmental initiatives and regulations related to the disposal of wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons, could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize underground injection wells. A lack of waste water disposal sites could cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans. Additionally, increased costs associated with the transportation and 
27

disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce our profitability. These costs are commonly incurred by all oil and gas producers and we do not believe the costs associated with the disposal of produced water will have a material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors. In 2015, we began operation of water recycling facilities in the SCOOP area that economically reuse stimulation water for both operational efficiencies and environmental benefits.
Employee Health and Safety. We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, as amended, and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 1,080 people. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. We utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services.
