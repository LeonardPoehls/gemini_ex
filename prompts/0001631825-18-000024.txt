Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Presidio, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the "Company," "Presidio" or "we") is a leading provider of information technology (“IT”) solutions to the middle market in North America. We enable business transformation through our expertise in IT solutions for agile, secure infrastructure solution sets, with a specific focus on Digital Infrastructure, Cloud and Security solutions. Our solutions are delivered through a broad suite of professional services, including strategy, consulting, design and implementation. We complement our professional services with project management, technology acquisition, managed services, maintenance and support to offer a full lifecycle model. Our services-led, lifecycle model leads to ongoing client engagement. As of June 30, 2018, we serve approximately 8,000 middle-market, large, and government organizations across a diverse range of industries.
Our clients are increasing dependent on Presidio to develop best of breed, vendor-agnostic agile, secure infrastructure solution sets comprised of Digital Infrastructure, Cloud, and Security solutions, which are described in more detail throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Through our increasing focus agile, secure infrastructure sets, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rapid growth in demand for Digital Infrastructure, Cloud and Security technologies. Within our three solutions areas, we offer customers enterprise-class solutions that are critical to driving digital transformation and expanding business capabilities. Examples of such solutions include advanced networking, IoT, data analytics, data center modernization, hybrid and multi-cloud, cyber risk management and enterprise mobility. These solutions are enabled by our expertise in foundational technologies, built upon our investments in network, data center, security, collaboration and mobility.
The middle market is a highly attractive segment of the IT services market, and we are differentiated by our strategic focus on this attractive segment. The increasing potential and complexity of emerging technologies and digital transformation are creating more demand for our solutions and services. Customers in the middle market are usually large enough to have substantial technology needs but typically have fewer IT resources and lack the broad expertise required to develop the necessary solutions as compared to larger companies. As a trusted solutions provider, our clients rely on us for IT investment decisions. We simplify IT for them by building solutions utilizing what we view as the best possible technologies. Since many large-scale IT service providers focus on larger enterprises, and because many resellers are unable to provide end-to-end solutions, we believe the middle market has remained underpenetrated and underserved.
We develop and maintain our long-term client relationships through a localized direct sales force of approximately 500 employees based in over 60 offices across the United States as of June 30, 2018. As a strategic partner and trusted advisor to our clients, we provide the expertise to implement new solutions, as well as optimize and better leverage existing IT resources. We provide strategy, consulting, design, customized deployment, integration and lifecycle management through our team of over 1,600 engineers as of June 30, 2018, enabling us to architect and manage the ideal IT solutions for our clients. Our local delivery model, combining relationship managers and expert engineering teams, allows us to win, retain and expand our client relationships.
Our client base is diversified across individual customers and industry verticals. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, only 21% of our revenue was attributable to our top 25 clients by revenue and no industry vertical accounted for more than 19% of our revenue. Among the verticals that we serve, healthcare, government, financial services, education, and professional services are our largest categories. We believe that our diversified client profile is a key driver of our ability to generate growth across different economic and technology cycles.
As of June 30, 2018, our backlog orders believed to be firm was approximately $582 million, compared to approximately $500 million as of June 30, 2017. Our backlog orders believed to be firm represents executed but unfulfilled client orders that we expect to result in actual revenue in future periods. The actual realization and timing of any of this revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and such realization may never occur or may change because an order could be reduced, modified or terminated early. Due to these uncertainties, we estimate that approximately $144 million of our backlog orders believed to be firm as of June 30, 2018 will not be fulfilled within the current fiscal year. Refer to the "Risk Factors" section for additional information about risks concerning our backlog orders. Additional financial information about our business segments is provided in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements," which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Growth Strategies
Expand and Deepen Relationships with Existing Clients

We have a long history of expanding revenue from existing clients by selling additional solutions based on their evolving needs. We believe increasing complexity in the market combined with our end-to-end IT solutions and our high-touch, lifecycle approach, position us for continued growth. This approach has resulted in strong client satisfaction and increasing client engagement that we believe will enable us to continue expanding our revenue per client as our clients leverage our expertise to adopt emerging technologies. As middle-market businesses embrace cloud capabilities and enhance digital security, we believe we are well positioned to capture increased spend from our existing client relationships.
Develop New Client Relationships
We believe the diverse and fragmented nature of the North American IT services market provides us with a significant opportunity to further grow our client base. We have developed domain expertise managing complex technologies and vertical specific-challenges, which makes us a compelling choice for potential clients looking for an IT solutions partner. Our efforts to develop new client relationships are supported by our existing, referable client base. With our technological capabilities and proven record of success with clients, we are well positioned to acquire more clients as the need grows for consulting, deployment, integration and managed services. We also conduct highly coordinated marketing and sales activities using the strength of the Presidio brand to win new clients and penetrate highly localized markets. In these markets, we are well positioned against smaller regional IT providers who lack the resources to invest in increasingly advanced IT solutions.
Develop and Offer New Services and Solutions
We focus on providing our clients with the highest quality, optimal solutions for their complex IT needs. We have developed innovative solutions for our clients across technology cycles and are currently developing and providing solutions based on emerging IT trends. Digital Infrastructure, Cloud and Security are some of the fastest growing areas of IT spend and we are focused on developing and deploying new solutions to serve these markets. For example, Presidio Concierge offering and our Next Generation Risk Management (“NGRM”) security offering help solve complex IT problems associated with these trends resulting in agile, secure infrastructure platforms. Through our national team of engineers, we maintain institutional knowledge and services capabilities that are adaptable, scalable, and transferable. We are constantly improving our offerings and developing new services and solutions for our clients, which we expect to drive incremental growth from existing and new clients.
Further Penetrate the North American Market
We have been expanding our geographic footprint in North America organically and inorganically and see new opportunities in several major regions. We take a deliberate and strategic approach to deciding which markets to pursue and consider a number of factors. Our expertise and solutions are scalable from region to region, so as we continue to expand we expect to take market share and create opportunities in new markets. 
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
We expect to continue to consider strategic acquisitions that can increase our technology expertise and geographic presence. We believe that our M&A strategy enhances and augments all of our growth avenues, including gaining capabilities, cross-selling to our existing clients and entering new markets and verticals. Since 2004, we have acquired and successfully integrated twelve companies, capitalizing on our scale, client relationships and vendor partnerships to drive margin expansion post-acquisition. In 2015, we acquired Sequoia Worldwide, LLC ("Sequoia"), a consulting, integration, and services company headquartered in California, which provided us with improved cloud consulting and integration capabilities. In 2016, we acquired Netech Corporation, an IT solutions provider headquartered in Michigan, which provided us with 11 offices to penetrate significant opportunities in the Midwestern United States. During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, we completed two acquisitions. In August 2017, we acquired Emergent Networks, LLC ("Emergent"), an IT solutions provider which expanded our geographic footprint into Minnesota and, in April 2018, we acquired Red Sky Solutions, LLC ("Red Sky"), which expanded our presence in the southwestern United States. We have been successful at integrating our acquisitions and retaining key management talent. These acquisitions are complementary with new office openings and the organic expansion of our presence in existing geographic markets. We expect to continue to selectively pursue acquisition opportunities within the highly fragmented IT solutions market, with a focus on enhancing our solutions offerings and geographic presence.

Our Competition
We believe we are the only national, vendor-agnostic IT services company that provides advanced end-to-end solutions through local high-touch relationships to the middle market. We believe we are competitively differentiated by our broad range of capabilities that we combine to offer best-in-class solutions to the middle market. We incorporate high-value services including strategy and consulting, design, implementation, optimization, and managed services, as well as technology expertise and strong vendor relationships. Across our solutions, we compete with companies such as Accenture, CDW, Deloitte, WWT, Dimension Data, DXC Technologies, ePlus, and Optiv. We categorize our competitors as:

• | Large Service Providers: Global service providers have scale and consulting capabilities but are not middle-market focused and generally do not provide all aspects of the IT value chain. We combine the scale, talent, technical expertise, and high-value services of the large service providers with end-to-end solution capabilities and a strategic middle-market focus.


• | Local and Regional Providers: Though local and regional providers often have strong local relationships, many of them have historically been focused on one or two IT areas. As IT complexity has increased, these providers have attempted to transition from a siloed approach toward a multi-technology and multi-vendor approach. However, the relatively small scale of local and regional providers makes investments across multiple, integrated technology stacks financially prohibitive and, as a result, these competitors are increasingly getting left behind as they lack the professional and managed services capabilities in digital infrastructure, cloud, IoT, and cybersecurity. Also, lack of capability and financial scale often excludes these providers from executing on larger, multi-geography projects and relationships and developing advanced services.


• | Boutique Specialists: Many boutique specialists focus in one distinct solution area rather than developing deep capabilities across the full range of IT challenges facing clients today. These firms are also typically sub-scale in terms of geographic coverage limiting their abilities to service larger, multi-location/multi-national customers. Our technical know-how across technologies and vendors, combined with our scale and broad client base, gives us the ability to deliver end-to-end offerings to much larger and more diverse end markets. As technologies continue to grow in complexity and interdependency, these providers will struggle to service client’s needs.


• | Resellers: Rather than focusing principally on product resale, we focus on consulting, solution delivery, and ongoing services that allow us to develop long-lasting client relationships. Our lifecycle engagement model focuses on a holistic approach that includes high-value services and end-to-end solutions.

Once issued, a patent generally has a term of 20 years from the date the application for the patent is filed. Seeking patent protection is part of our strategy for competitively differentiating our hybrid cloud solution, but patent protection is not essential to our company as a whole or to our Presidio Managed Cloud or Presidio Concierge business.

Corporate History
Known originally as Integrated Solutions, LLC, Presidio was capitalized by an investor group in 2003 to address the need for an elite professional services firm that was focused on providing advanced technology solutions to middle-market businesses. Our early focus was to expand our regional presence and skill set expertise through both organic growth and acquisitions. By 2010, we had completed six acquisitions that complemented our core competencies, helping expand Presidio’s presence to 33 offices in 18 states. 
On February 2, 2015, certain investment funds affiliated with or managed by Apollo and its subsidiaries, including Apollo VIII, along with their parallel investment funds (the "Apollo Funds") acquired Presidio Holdings Inc., at which time Presidio Holdings Inc. became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. We applied the acquisition method of accounting that created a new basis of accounting for the Company as of that date. 
On March 15, 2017, the Company completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) in which the Company issued and sold 18,766,465 shares of common stock, inclusive of 2,099,799 shares issued and sold on March 21, 2017 pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, at the public offering price of $14.00 per share.  The Company received net proceeds of $247.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions from the sale of its shares in the IPO.  
On November 21, 2017, the Company completed a secondary public offering of 8,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock by certain funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (the “Selling Stockholder”) at a price to the public of $14.25 per share. In addition, the underwriters to such secondary public offering purchased an additional 1,200,000 shares of common stock from the Selling Stockholder. The Company did not sell any shares and did not receive any proceeds from the offering.
