ITEM 1. Business
As used herein, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Parkway” and the “Company” refer to Parkway, Inc., a Maryland corporation, individually or together with its subsidiaries, including Parkway Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and our predecessors. The term “Operating Partnership” refers to Parkway Operating Partnership LP individually or together with its subsidiaries. 
Overview
We are an independent, publicly traded, self-managed REIT that owns and operates high-quality office properties located in attractive submarkets in Houston, Texas. Our portfolio consists of five Class A assets comprising 19 buildings and totaling approximately 8.7 million rentable square feet in the Greenway, Galleria and Westchase submarkets of Houston, providing geographic focus and significant operational scale and efficiencies. Our portfolio has proven to be resilient throughout market cycles and is occupied by a diversified customer base with strong credit profiles and limited near-term lease expirations. We believe that the creation of a geographically focused REIT with a strong balance sheet and targeted internal value-creation opportunities will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders while providing a platform for external growth opportunities over the longer-term. 
In addition, the Company operates a fee-based real estate service (the “Third-Party Services Business”) through a wholly owned subsidiary, Eola Office Partners, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Eola”), which in total managed approximately 3.8 million square feet (unaudited) for primarily third-party owners as of December 31, 2016
Our mission is to own and operate high-quality office properties located in attractive submarkets in Houston, with a primary focus on unlocking value within our existing portfolio through implementing active and creative leasing strategies, leveraging our scale to increase pricing power in lease and vendor negotiations and targeting redevelopment and asset repositioning opportunities. We plan to maintain a conservative balance sheet with low leverage and ample liquidity, which we expect will allow us to access multiple sources of capital. We believe that this strategy will support both our internal growth initiatives and our patient and disciplined approach to pursuing new investment opportunities at the appropriate time. We believe that this strategy, combined with our highly experienced management team that has a successful history of operating a publicly traded REIT, significant expertise in the Houston, Texas office sector and extensive relationships with industry participants, positions us for long-term internal and external growth. 
Our Spin-Off from Cousins
On October 7, 2016, pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Cousins completed the Spin-Off of our company by distributing all of our outstanding shares of common and limited voting stock to the holders of Cousins common and limited voting preferred stock as of the record date, October 6, 2016.
We were incorporated on June 3, 2016 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Parkway. On October 6, 2016, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Legacy Parkway merged with and into Clinic Sub Inc., with Clinic Sub Inc. continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cousins. In connection with the Merger, we became a subsidiary of Cousins. Immediately following the effective time of the Merger, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, Cousins separated the Houston Business from the remainder of the combined businesses. In connection with the Separation and UPREIT Reorganization, the Houston Business was transferred to us, and the remainder of the combined business was transferred to Cousins LP, the operating partnership of Cousins. Following the Separation and UPREIT Reorganization, Cousins effected the Spin-Off on October 7, 2016. 
Greenway Properties Joint Venture
On February 17, 2017, we, through our Operating Partnership and certain other subsidiaries, entered into an Omnibus Contribution and Partial Interest Assignment Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with an affiliate of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (“CPPIB”) and an entity controlled by TH Real Estate Global Asset Management and Silverpeak Real Estate Partners (“TIAA/SP”). Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, we have agreed to sell to these two investors, indirectly through a new joint venture, an aggregate 49% interest in our Greenway Plaza and Phoenix Tower properties (the “Greenway Properties”). The new joint venture is expected to be owned 51% through subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership (with 1% being held by a subsidiary acting as the general partner and 50% being held by a subsidiary acting as a limited partner) and 24.5% by each of CPPIB and TIAA/SP, each as a limited partner of the joint venture. TIAA/SP will acquire its aggregate percentage interest in two 
5

tranches over a three business day period. The Contribution Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and interim operating covenants of the parties that are subject, in some cases, to specified exceptions and qualifications, and the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions. Obtaining the new mortgage financing described below is not a condition to closing. Closing under the Contribution Agreement is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2017, subject to extension to an outside date of May 31, 2017, which may be further extended to June 21, 2017 in certain circumstances. We cannot provide assurances that the Greenway Properties joint venture transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
At closing under the Contribution Agreement, a subsidiary of the joint venture expects to assume the existing mortgage loan on Phoenix Tower and to enter into new mortgage financing of up to $465 million secured by the Greenway Plaza properties, as described below. At closing, the Operating Partnership will use a portion of the proceeds of the new mortgage financing and the purchase price received from the investors, in each case net of required reserves, to repay all amounts outstanding under our current credit facility, dated October 6, 2016, by and among us, the Operating Partnership, Bank of America, N.A. and certain other parties, and to fund a credit to the joint venture with respect to certain outstanding contractual lease obligations and in-process capital expenditures. The remainder of these proceeds will be retained by us for general corporate purposes.
In connection with the Contribution Agreement, the Operating Partnership received a debt commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) from Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company (“Goldman Sachs”) pursuant to which Goldman Sachs has, among other things, agreed to provide the joint venture and certain of its subsidiaries a mortgage loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $465 million (the “Loan”) secured by the Greenway Plaza properties and all related assets. On February 22, 2017, the Operating Partnership and Goldman Sachs entered into the Commitment Letter and a rate lock agreement. Funding of the Loan is subject to certain other conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter.
Competitive Strengths 
Accomplished management team with a demonstrated track record of acquiring, operating and repositioning assets and managing a public office REIT. Our management team, led by Mr. James R. Heistand, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has extensive experience in the office real estate industry, including in operations, leasing, acquisition, development and disposition of office assets through all stages of the real estate cycle, and has a proven track record of executing business strategies and delivering strong results for stockholders. Since joining Legacy Parkway in the fourth quarter of 2011 through October 6, 2016, our management team acquired $3.9 billion of high-quality, Class A office assets and disposed of approximately $2.6 billion of non-core assets resulting in approximately $290.0 million of net gains. During this time, our management team also realized significant portfolio-wide operational improvements as evidenced by a 47.6% increase in average in-place rents and an increase in the leased percentage of the portfolio from 85.7% to 90.5%. In addition, our management team has proven its ability to be creative in unlocking value from complex transactions and to create stockholder value through targeted asset sales and strategic capital recycling. Through this experience, our management team has proven its strong execution capabilities and established relationships with industry participants. 
Houston focus with local and regional expertise. We are focused initially on owning and operating office properties in Houston, Texas, which is a region we believe is well-positioned for economic recovery. We believe our position as a “pure-play” Houston real estate company allows us to have a targeted focus on property performance that otherwise could be diluted in a company with more geographically diverse holdings. Additionally, our management and property-level teams have in-depth knowledge of the Houston real estate market and an extensive network of long-standing relationships with leading local, regional and national industry participants that we believe will drive our ability to identify and capitalize on internal and external value-creation opportunities and attractive acquisition opportunities as well as identify opportunities with potential joint venture partners, as such opportunities arise from time to time. 
High-quality portfolio of Class A office assets concentrated in desirable, resilient Houston submarkets. We own five Class A assets comprising 19 buildings and totaling approximately 8.7 million square feet in the Greenway, Galleria and Westchase submarkets, which are among the most desirable submarkets in Houston. These particular submarkets have a strong track record of outperforming the overall Houston market in rental rates, occupancy and value improvement over time. They are located adjacent to many high-income residential areas and offer state-of-the-art amenities, including high-end retail, restaurants, entertainment and recreational activities. We are the largest landlord in each of these submarkets, owning 60% of the Class A office inventory in Greenway, 15% in Galleria, and 15% in Westchase based on square footage as of December 31, 2016. We expect that these ownership levels will lead to pricing power in lease and vendor negotiations; the ability to attract, hire and retain superior local market leadership and leasing teams; flexibility to meet changing customer space demands; and an enhanced ability to identify and capitalize on emerging investment opportunities.

High-quality, creditworthy customer base with limited near-term lease maturities. Our diversified customer base generally consists of high-quality and creditworthy customers. As of December 31, 2016, nearly 47% of our customers based on annual base rent had investment grade credit ratings from major credit rating agencies. In order to monitor the credit quality of our customers, our property management teams communicate regularly with all of our customers. We receive monthly credit reports for the largest customers in our portfolio and regularly review the financials of those customers that are in the energy industry. Further, with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately six years as of December 31, 2016, our portfolio has limited near-term lease maturities which is expected to provide stable cash flows with minimal decline in contractual revenue over the next several years. 
Flexible and conservative capital structure. We believe our flexible and conservative capital structure provides us with an advantage over many of our private and public competitors. We have limited near-term debt maturities, and as of December 31, 2016, approximately $230.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and up to $100 million of additional liquidity through a revolving credit facility (“the Revolving Credit Facility”), all of which provide financial flexibility, support ongoing capital improvement needs and reinforce our business and growth strategies of unlocking the value in our portfolio through leasing and asset repositioning. In addition, we believe our conservative approach to balance sheet management may provide strategic benefits by providing us with enhanced access to multiple sources of attractively priced capital that may not be available to many of our competitors in Houston. We also believe that our moderate leverage and strong liquidity will enable us to take advantage of attractive redevelopment and acquisition opportunities as they rise from time to time. 
Embedded growth opportunities through leasing, asset repositioning and redevelopment. Our portfolio has significant, identified embedded growth opportunities both through leasing the remaining vacancies in the portfolio and through targeted asset repositioning and redevelopment opportunities. We expect that our initial focus on one geographic location, combined with our strong balance sheet, market knowledge and customer relationships, will allow us to successfully execute internal and external growth strategies. With our scale, we expect that we will have the ability to attract, hire and maintain a best-in-class leasing team that will help us identify opportunities early and implement aggressive and creative leasing strategies at our properties. We also own assets that offer various pricing points within the same submarkets, giving us the flexibility to move and relocate customers within our portfolio based on their changing needs, which we expect will lead to higher customer retention. We also believe there are opportunities to add revenue-generating amenities to our assets, such as additional retail options and parking. We believe that our management team’s experience, as well as its ability to exclusively focus on our growth strategy following the Spin-Off will allow us to unlock the value that we expect exists in our portfolio. 
Business and Growth Strategies
Maximize cash flow growth and value through proactive asset management and leasing strategies. We believe we are well-positioned to drive growth in cash flow and maximize the value of our portfolio with proactive, creative and aggressive leasing and asset management strategies. We also expect that our substantial scale in the Greenway, Galleria and Westchase submarkets will provide us with enhanced visibility into submarket dynamics that will lead to stronger negotiating leverage with customers and vendors and will result in a potential reduction in our operating costs and improvement in NOI over time. We expect that we will also be able to leverage our broad existing customer relationships, leading market position and deep financial flexibility to attract new, high-quality customers, increase occupancy over the long-term and maximize customer retention rates at our properties. 
Focus on unlocking value through repositioning and redeveloping existing properties. We expect that our management team will devote significant attention to internal value-creating investment opportunities that are intended to generate attractive growth in revenues and cash flow, enhancing the value of our portfolio. Specifically, we expect to leverage our real estate expertise to reposition and redevelop our existing properties, as well as properties that we may acquire in the future, with the objective of increasing occupancy, rental rates and risk-adjusted returns on our invested capital. As the Houston, Texas market continues to recover, our management team will seek to identify investment opportunities, that include creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in certain of our properties, that will create value for our stockholders, enable us to better serve our customers, be consistent with our strategic objectives and have attractive risk-return profiles. 
Maintain a conservative, flexible balance sheet with adequate liquidity to fund near-term growth opportunities. We maintain a conservative capital structure that will provide the resources and flexibility to position our company for both internal and external growth. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $230.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $100 million of additional liquidity through the Revolving Credit Facility. We focus on maintaining sufficient liquidity with minimal short-term debt maturities, allowing us to pursue value enhancement strategies within our portfolio and support acquisition activities as they may arise from time to time. Initially, we expect to maintain a mix of property-level secured indebtedness as well as corporate debt secured by a pool of assets. As the Houston market recovers, we anticipate funding additional growth opportunities 
 7

through proceeds received from asset dispositions, joint ventures, the refinancing of debt or public equity offerings. We also expect to target a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA multiple of no more than 6.0x. 

Pursue acquisitions with a patient, prudent approach. While our initial focus is to unlock internal embedded growth in our existing portfolio, we intend to take advantage of current and future market dislocation in Houston to capitalize on emerging acquisition opportunities within our current submarkets as well as other Houston submarkets, if such assets meet our investment criteria. We may also acquire assets in other markets from time to time if such opportunities meet our investment criteria. However, we intend to devote the majority of our resources to sourcing opportunities within the Houston market for the foreseeable future. We believe that our management team’s in-depth market knowledge and relationships and its extensive acquisitions experience will enhance our ability to source new acquisition opportunities as they may arise from time to time. Whether we operate exclusively in Houston, or diversify our market exposure over the longer-term, our management team will use a patient, prudent and disciplined approach to investment decision-making. 
Competition
We compete with a number of developers, owners and operators of office and commercial real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same Houston submarkets in which our properties are located, and some of which have greater financial resources than we do. In operating and managing our portfolio, we compete for customers based on a number of factors, including location, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for customer improvements), security, flexibility and expertise to design space to meet prospective customers’ needs, quality and breadth of customer services provided and the manner in which the property is operated, maintained and marketed. As leases at our properties expire, we may encounter significant competition to renew or re-let space in light of the large number of competing properties within the submarkets in which we operate. As a result, we may be required to provide rent concessions or abatements, incur charges for customer improvements and other inducements, including early termination rights or below-market renewal options, or we may not be able to timely lease vacant space. In that case, the per share trading price of our common stock, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders may be adversely affected.
We will also face competition when pursuing acquisition and disposition opportunities. Our competitors may be able to pay higher property acquisition prices, may have private access to opportunities not available to us or may otherwise be in a better position to acquire a property. Competition may also have the effect of reducing the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us, increasing the price required to consummate an acquisition opportunity and generally reducing the demand for commercial office space in our submarkets. Likewise, competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers may result in our receiving lower proceeds from a sale or in our not being able to dispose of a property at a time of our choosing due to the lack of an acceptable return.
Administration
We, were formed as a corporation under the laws of the state of Maryland in June 2016, and we intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our short taxable year that commenced on the day prior to the Spin-Off and ended December 31, 2016 upon the filing of our U.S. federal income tax return for such year. We generally perform commercial real estate leasing, management and acquisition services on an in-house basis. As of December 31, 2016, we had 158 employees. Our principal executive office is located at 5847 San Felipe Street, Suite 2200, Houston, Texas 77057 and our telephone number is (346) 200-3100. In addition, we have two regional offices in Jacksonville, Florida and Orlando, Florida.
Insurance
We or customers at our properties, carry comprehensive commercial general liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption, rental loss coverage, environmental and umbrella liability coverage on all of our properties. We also carry wind and flood coverage on properties in areas where we believe such coverage is warranted, in each case with limits of liability that we deem adequate based on industry practice. Similarly, our properties are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts we believe to be adequate to reimburse us, on a replacement cost basis, for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. We believe that the insurance coverage on our properties contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets, and we believe our properties are adequately insured. However, we may be subject to certain types of losses that are generally uninsured losses, including, but not limited to, losses caused by riots, chemical, biological, nuclear and radiation acts of terrorism, war or acts of God. In the opinion of our management, our properties are adequately insured given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and industry practice.

Regulation
We believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations. Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of the properties in our portfolio have the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business. For more information, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Properties and Business.”
Americans with Disabilities Act
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), to the extent that our properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require, among other things, (1) the removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable, and (2) the reasonable modification of policies, practices and procedures that deny equal access to persons with disabilities. The ADA also requires that the design and construction of new facilities and some alterations comply with certain accessibility guidelines. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Properties and Business-Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act could result in substantial costs.”
Environmental Matters
Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, current and former owners and operators of real estate are liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on such real estate. These laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect an owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In connection with our ownership and operation of our properties, we may be potentially liable for such costs. The operations of current and former customers at our properties have involved, or may have involved, the use of hazardous materials or generated hazardous wastes. The release of such hazardous materials and wastes could result in the incurrence of liabilities to remediate any resulting contamination, if the responsible party is unable or unwilling to do so. In addition, our properties are located in urban areas, and are therefore exposed to the risk of contamination originating from third-party sources. While a property owner may not be held responsible for remediating contamination that has migrated onsite from an offsite source, the contaminant’s presence can have material adverse effects on our business, operations and the redevelopment of our properties. We are not aware of any environmental condition that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position (before consideration of any potential insurance coverage). Nevertheless, it is possible that there are material environmental conditions and liabilities of which we are unaware. Moreover, no assurances can be given that (1) future laws, ordinances or regulations or future interpretations of existing requirements will not impose any material environmental liability or (2) the current environmental condition of our properties has not been or will not be affected by customers and occupants of our properties, by the condition of properties in the vicinity of our properties or by third parties. For more information, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Properties and Business.”
Emerging Growth Company Status 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that apply to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the requirements to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If we do take advantage of some or all of these exemptions, some investors may find our common stock less attractive. The result may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. This election is irrevocable. 
 9

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (b) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (c) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur on the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (d) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
