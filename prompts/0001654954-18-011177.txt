 Year End Summary
  
 The year ending June 30, 2018 brought several notable improvements in key areas of the Company’s financial results:
  
  ● Revenues almost doubled to $1,649,501 from $879,984
   ● The Net Loss for the year was reduced by over 50% to $4,253,199 from $8,518,359
   ● The Net Cash Used in Operations decreased approximately 42% to $2,381,321 from $4,103,327
   ● Current Liabilities (excluding Derivative Liabilities) decreased approximately 25% to $5,719,912 from $7,686,843
  
  Revenues were generated through the sale of the Company’s Aftermaster Pro TV audio remastering units, rentals of its Hollywood recording studio facilities, music production, mixing and mastering services and its Promaster division. During the year, the Company also sold $520,000 of its Aftermaster Pro units to its product manufacturer which reduced its current debt by $490,000. The Company determined under US GAAP the sales should be recorded as net sales of $30,000 resulting in total sales of $1,649,501 for the year ended June 30, 2018.
  
 In October of 2018, the Company hired a new head of marketing and an accompanying team to focus on licensing the Company’s unique and award winning audio technology, as well as build sales for its current and future products.
  
 During the year, the Company was awarded another patent relating to its Aftermaster technology. This was the Company’s eighth issued audio and visual related patent and is one of several patents that are filed and pending.
  
 During the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, the Company secured purchase orders and has generated revenues, which together, exceed the entire revenue for the year ending June 30, 2018. The Company’s ability to deliver on the purchase orders (which represent a majority of the potential sales) is subject to the Company securing sufficient manufacturing and operating capital, as well as reliable product manufacturing. If the Company has access to such resources, it expects to see substantial growth in the coming year from both its existing operations and the new products that it plans to introduce.
  
  Business and Products
  
  Adventego Strategic Partnership
  
  On May 6, 2018 the Company entered into a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Advantego Corporation of Denver, Colorado, wherein Adventego will have the rights to promote and distribute Aftermaster’s proprietary consumer TV audio product, Aftermaster Pro (patents issued and pending), to thousands of professional clinics serving the hearing impaired (audiological) market in North America. Advantego Corporation designs, develops and implements digital communications and intelligent software solutions as a specialized Business Process as a Service (BPaaS). The Aftermaster Pro will be added to a marketing campaign that Adventego is undertaking with its strategic partners to promote public awareness about hearing loss and provide support products to patients and family members visiting the 15,000+ audiological hearing aid clinics in North America.
  
  The Aftermaster Pro is especially coveted by those with hearing loss impairment for watching TV. The Aftermaster Pro not only boosts and clarifies TV dialogue but also delivers unparalleled clarity, depth, fullness and volume throughout the entire frequency range without any compromises. Unlike other audio post-production processes, Aftermaster preserves the original intention of an audio event and brings greater clarity, depth and amplitude to all audio elements without changing the integrity of the underlying production.
  
  Muzik Headphones
  
  On November 4, 2017 the Company entered into an agreement with headphone manufacturer Muzik, Inc., to license its Aftermaster technology (through both its Company’s proprietary DSP chip and software application). Known as the “smartphone” of headphones, award-winning Muzik has created the worlds most advanced wireless headphone. Muzik's proprietary voice command and multiple "hot keys" allow a user to access Spotify, Siri and connect their headphones to over 300 apps from fitness, news, and productivity to the connected home, commerce, automotive, and social media. Muzik is considered the most important new headphone designer and manufacturer. The Company expects its technology to be implemented in Muzik products in the first quarter of 2018.

  TuneCore Agreement
  
  Aftermaster offers both world-class, professional hands-on mastering services and instant online mastering through its Promaster brand for music, TV and film customers in its facilities in Hollywood, California. The Professional Mastering division is headed up by Peter Doell, one of the world’s foremost mastering engineers.

The Home Shopping Network is one of the world’s largest television retailers. The launch was considered very successful and HSN has subsequently issued multi purchase orders for thousands more units. New airing dates began on June 9, 2017, and have been followed by multiple airings the latest being in July, 2018. HSN provides a unique format which provides the Company with the opportunity to showcase the quality of the product, while explaining the differentiating features and operation of its Aftermaster Pro on national television. The Company expects that Aftermaster Pro will continue to be featured on HSN and other television, online and store based retailers.

  Aftermaster Consumer and Professional Electronics Products
  
  The Company has assembled a world-class branding, technical and design team who have design the Company’s consumer and professional electronics products. The first consumer electronics product to be introduced was the Aftermaster Pro, designed to dramatically improve the quality of TV audio. Aftermaster Pro is the world’s first personal audio re-mastering device and defines a new category in consumer electronics products by offering a product never before offered. Aftermaster Pro is a proprietary, first-to-market product which has no direct competition.
  
  The number of existing televisions worldwide is substantial, and a majority of TV owners complain about their TV audio quality, especially the need to continually adjust the volume because of the difficulty in hearing dialogue in certain programming.
  
  Smaller than an iPhone, the Aftermaster Pro transforms the audio of a TV to sound clearer, fuller, deeper, and more exciting. Aftermaster Pro connects easily via HDMI cables with virtually any A/V media source (i.e., cable, satellite box, etc.). Aftermaster Pro raises and clarifies TV dialogue in programming while significantly enhancing the quality of the overall audio content. This solves the longstanding need to continually adjust volume during a TV show to hear the dialogue.
  
  The Aftermaster Pro debuted to consumers on national television on the Home Shopping Network (“HSN”) show on April 15, 2017. The Aftermaster Pro sales were deemed to be very successful, and the product has since been featured on multiple HSN programs.
  
  The Aftermaster Pro is also for sale at and is available at several other prominent online retail outlets including Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Crate and Barrel's "CB2" stores as well as the Company’s own website, Aftermasterpro.com. The Company has engaged an on-line marketing firm and began an online advertising campaign on February 1, 2018 to direct buyers to our various online retailers and our aftermasterpro.com website
  
  The Company has also recently designed and developed its first professional hardware product dubbed the “Aftermaster Studio Pro” which is the Company’s first product designed for use in commercial audio applications. The new product is a 1 U, 19” rack-mount Aftermaster audio processor that allows a user to enhance any audio playback with Aftermaster to make their sound fuller, clearer, louder and deeper. It is expected to retail for $3,995 and can be seen at www.aftermastermaster.com/products. The Company believes that the worldwide market for its new product is significant, as it can be used in potentially hundreds of thousands of applications worldwide: radio stations, private and public recording studios, places of worship, restaurants and bars, sports facilities, high-end residential, live concerts and concert facilities, hospitals – virtually any place where a business wants the audio to sound significantly better than anything they can do in house. The product is expected to be available for pre-sale in the near future.

  Additional Aftermaster branded consumer electronics products are under development, which we expect to introduce in the coming year.
  
  ON Semiconductor/Aftermaster Audio Chip and Software
  
  The Company entered into a joint development and marketing agreement with ON Semiconductor ("ON") of Phoenix, Arizona, to commercialize its technology through audio semiconductor chips. ON is a multi-billion dollar, multi-national semiconductor designer and manufacturer.
  
  The agreement called for ON to implement and support our Aftermaster technology in a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) semiconductor chip to be marketed to their current OEM customers, distributors and others. We selected ON for its technical capabilities, sales support and deep customer pool.
  
  In conjunction with ON, we have completed the development of an Aftermaster software algorithm that is designed to be used in semiconductor chips or as a standalone software product. We believe the sound quality from our algorithm provides a superior audio experience relative to other products on the market.
  
  Now branded the BelaSigna 300 AM chip, it is one of the smallest, high power/low voltage DSP chips available. It is small enough to fit into a hearing aid but equally effective in any size device with audio capability.
  
  The algorithm and chips allow consumer product manufacturers an opportunity to offer a significantly improved and differential audio experience in their products without having to significantly change hardware and form factor designs. Through the combined relationships of the Company and ON, we hope to generate significant revenues for both parties through the sale of the ON/Aftermaster chips and software licensing.
  
  Promaster
  
  Promaster is an online music mastering, streaming, and storage service designed for independent artists which utilizes proprietary audio technologies developed by Aftermaster.
  
  Tens of millions of songs are produced, distributed and played on the Internet each month around the world by independent artists. However, many of these artists lack the financial and technical means to master, or “finish” their composition, as a professional mastering session can cost up to $500 per song. Now, with the Promaster online platform, musicians can transmit their music directly to the Promaster HD website, where it can be mastered with Aftermaster technology for $9.99 per song. Each user receives four different mastered versions of their song done in different styles, and they can preview 90 seconds of each version to make a decision about whether or not they want to buy it.
  
  Promaster creates a compelling offering for those seeking to significantly enhance the quality of their music for personal use, or with intent to showcase their music in hopes of advancing their career aspirations. The service also offers additional features such as file storage. Based on the enormous addressable market for this product, we believe that with effective marketing Promaster has the potential to generate significant revenues for the Company.

  Recording and Mastering Studios
  
  Aftermaster operates six (6) recording and mastering studios at its Hollywood California facility. The Company’s engineers mix and master music for both independent and high profile artists, most recently the music for the hit TV show "Empire". When available, the Company also rents its studios to third party artists and producers.
  
  The Company recently took over the former recording studio built by music legend Graham Nash o Crosby, Stills and Nash in 1977, which is located next to its existing studios. The Company recently completely renovated the studio and installed state-of-the-art equipment. www.aftermaster.com/studios
  
  Aftermaster Audio Technology
  
  Aftermaster audio technology was created and developed pursuant to a multi-year, multi-million dollar development effort to make digital audio sound substantially better by developing proprietary software, digital signal processing technology and consumer products. The Aftermaster Audio Labs team is comprised of a unique group of award-winning industry leaders in music, technology and audio engineering which includes Ari Blitz, Peter Doell, Rodney Jerkins, Larry Ryckman, Justin Timberlake, Andrew Wuepper and Shelly Yakus. See www.Aftermaster.com.

  The Aftermaster audio technology is an internally-developed, proprietary (patented and patents pending) mastering, remastering and audio processing technology which makes virtually any audio source sound significantly louder, fuller, deeper and clearer. Aftermaster is a groundbreaking technology which eliminates the weaknesses found in other audio enhancement and processing technologies while offering a much superior audio experience for consumer and industrial applications. We believe that our Aftermaster audio technology is one of the most significant breakthroughs in digital audio processing technology and has the potential to create significant revenues for the Company. The broad commercialization of this technology is a top priority for the Company.
  
  As the convergence of features on consumer electronics continues, it is becoming more difficult for leading consumer electronics companies to differentiate their products. We believe that Aftermaster provides a unique and significant competitive advantage for consumer electronics manufacturers by offering their customers a superior audio experience. Aftermaster technology can be incorporated into most audio capable devices through the addition of an Aftermaster DSP chip or Aftermaster software. Such uses are intended to include phones (i.e., mobile, home, business and VoIP); headphones; televisions; stereo speakers; stereos (i.e., home, portable, commercial and automobile); and computers (i.e., desktop, laptop and tablets).
  
  Aftermaster audio is also the only commercial audio enhancement technology available that is used for professional music mastering because it enhances the entire frequency range without distortion or changing the underlying intent of the music. The technology has been used to master music created by some of the world’s most popular artists. Further information on Aftermaster and Aftermaster products can be found at www.Aftermaster.com.
  
  Intellectual Property and Licensing
  
  The Company has been awarded eight patents and multiple trademarks with numerous others pending. The Company has an aggressive intellectual property strategy to protect the Aftermaster and the related technologies it has developed. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We rigorously control access to our proprietary technologies. The Company has engaged Morgan Chu of Irell and Manella, to represent its intellectual property interests along with its existing IP attorneys Farjami & Farjami LLP and Arnold Weintraub of the Weintraub Group. Mr. Weintraub serves on the Board of Directors of the Company.
 Employees
  
  As of June 30, 2018, we employed eleven full-time employees. We expect to seek additional employees in the next year to handle anticipated potential growth.
  
  We believe that our relationship with our employees are good.  None of our employees are members of any union, nor have they entered into any collective bargaining agreements.
