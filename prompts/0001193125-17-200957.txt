  Item 1.    Business
We are a multi-market integrated semiconductor company. We specialize in the development, manufacture and marketing of high performance power semiconductors, advanced mixed-signal integrated circuits, or ICs, application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, microcontrollers, systems and radio frequency, or RF, power semiconductors. 
 Our power semiconductors improve system efficiency and reliability by converting electricity at relatively high voltage and current levels into the finely regulated power required by electronic products. We focus on the market for power semiconductors that are capable of processing greater than 200 watts of power. 
 Our power semiconductor products have historically been divided into two primary categories, power MOS, or metal-oxide-silicon, transistors and bipolar products. Our power semiconductors are sold as individual units and are also packaged in high power modules that frequently consist of multiple semiconductor die. In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, or fiscal 2017, power semiconductors constituted approximately 68.8% of our revenues, which included 32.5% of revenues from power MOS transistors and related products and 36.3% of revenues from bipolar products. References to revenues in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute references to net revenues, except where the context otherwise requires. 
 Our power semiconductor products are used primarily to control electricity in: 
 

 | power conversion systems, including uninterruptible power supplies, or UPS, and switch-mode power supplies, or SMPS, for applications, such as communications infrastructure, including wireless base stations, network servers and telecommunication switching stations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | motor drives for industrial applications, such as industrial transportation, robotics, automation and process control equipment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | medical electronics for sophisticated applications, such as defibrillators and MRI equipment; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines and solar systems.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 We design and sell ICs that have applications in appliances, telecommunications, display, power management and security systems. In fiscal 2017, ICs constituted approximately 25.4% of our revenues. 
 Our microcontroller semiconductor products are designed for a variety of applications, including consumer electronics, home appliances and security systems. Our mixed-signal ICs are used in telecommunications products, central office switching equipment, customer premises equipment, set top boxes, remote meter reading equipment, security systems, advanced flat displays, medical electronics and defense aerospace systems. 
 Our systems include laser diode drivers, high voltage pulse generators and modulators, and high power subsystems, sometimes known as stacks, that are principally based on our high power semiconductor devices.

 We also design and sell RF power semiconductors that switch electricity at the high rates required by circuitry that generates radio frequencies. Our RF power devices are used in wireless infrastructure, industrial RF applications, medical systems and defense and space electronics. In fiscal 2017, systems and RF power semiconductors constituted approximately 5.8% of our revenues. 
 We design our power semiconductor, ICs, and systems and RF power semiconductor products primarily for industrial and business applications, rather than for use in consumer electronics. 
 In fiscal 2017, our products were used by over 3,500 end customers worldwide. Our major end customers include ABB, Boston Scientific, General Electric, Medtronic, Nidec, Schneider Electric, Siemens and Universal Electronics. 
 We were founded in 1983 and are incorporated in the state of Delaware. 
 Background 
 The worldwide demand for electrical energy is currently increasing due to: 
 

 | proliferation of technology-driven products that require electricity, including computers, telecommunications equipment and the infrastructure to support portable electronics;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | increased use of electronic content in traditional products such as automobiles and home appliances;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | increased use of automation and electrical processes in industry and mass transit systems;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | growth of the internet and mobile telecommunications demand; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | penetration of technology into developing countries.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 Not only is demand increasing, but the requirements for electricity are also changing. Electronic products in all markets are becoming increasingly sophisticated, offering more intelligence through the use of microprocessors and additional solid-state components. The increasing complexity of such products requires more precisely regulated power and greater power reliability. In addition, the increasing costs of electricity, coupled with governmental regulations and environmental concerns, have caused an increased demand for energy efficiency. 
 Power semiconductors are used to provide the precisely regulated power required by sophisticated electronic products and equipment and address the growing demand for energy efficiency. In most cases, power semiconductors: 
 

 | convert, or rectify, alternating current, or AC, power delivered by electrical utilities to the direct current, or DC, power that is required by most electronic equipment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | convert DC power at a certain voltage level to DC power at a different voltage level to meet the specific voltage requirement for an application;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | invert DC power to high frequency AC power to permit the processing of power through the use of substantially smaller electronic components; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | rectify high frequency AC power from switch-mode power supplies to meet the specific DC voltage and frequency required by an application.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Power semiconductors improve system efficiency and reliability by processing and converting electrical energy into more usable, higher quality power. Specifically, our power semiconductors are used primarily in controlling energy in power conversion systems, including switch-mode power supplies and uninterruptible power supplies, and in motor drive controls. Switch-mode power supplies efficiently convert power to meet the specific voltage requirements of an application, such as communications equipment. Uninterruptible power supplies provide a short-term backup of electricity in the event of power failure. Motor drive controls regulate the voltage, current and frequency of power to a motor. 
 Our microcontrollers are used to control electronic devices such as remote controllers, motors and user interfaces on appliances. With the growth in telecommunications, data communications and wireless 
 
4 
 
 communications, the demand for analog and mixed-signal ICs has grown. Our mixed-signal ICs address the interface between telecommunication and data communication components, both in the central office and in gateway applications, especially with the increased use of the internet protocol, or IP. Our RF power semiconductors are used in wireless infrastructure and in other microwave communication applications. Technical advancement in the communication industries is expected, in part, to drive the demand for higher performance semiconductors. 
 Power Semiconductors 
 Our power semiconductor products have historically been divided into two primary categories: power MOS transistors and bipolar products. Our power semiconductors are sold separately and are also packaged in high power modules that frequently consist of multiple semiconductor dice. In fiscal 2017, power semiconductors constituted approximately 68.8% of our revenues, which included about 32.5% of revenues from power MOS transistors and related products, and about 36.3% of revenues from bipolar products. In fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, or fiscal 2016, power semiconductors constituted approximately 67.3% of our revenues, which included about 30.9% of revenues from power MOS transistors and about 36.4% of revenues from bipolar products. In fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, or fiscal 2015, power semiconductors constituted approximately 64.8% of our revenues, which included about 26.1% of revenues from power MOS transistors and about 37.0% of revenues from bipolar products. 
Power MOS Transistors 
 Power MOS transistors operate at much greater switching speeds than bipolar transistors, allowing the design of smaller and less costly end products. Power MOS transistors are activated by voltage rather than current, so they require less external circuitry to operate, making them more compatible with IC controls. Power MOS transistors also offer more reliable long term performance and are more rugged than traditional bipolar transistors, permitting them to better withstand adverse operating conditions. Our power MOS transistors consist of power MOSFETs and IGBTs. 

 | Power MOSFETs. A power MOSFET, or metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistor, is a switch controlled by voltage at the gate. Power MOSFETs are used in combination with passive components to vary the amperage and frequency of electricity by switching on and off at high frequency. With voltage ratings ranging from 36 to 4,700 volts, our power MOSFETs are used primarily in power conversion systems and are focused on higher voltage applications. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | IGBTs. IGBTs, or insulated-gate bipolar transistors, also are used as switches. IGBTs have achieved many of the advantages of power MOSFETs and of traditional bipolar technology by combining the voltage-controlled switching features of power MOSFETs with the superior conductivity and energy efficiency of bipolar transistors. For a given semiconductor die size, IGBTs can operate at higher currents and voltages, making them more cost-effective devices for high energy applications than power MOSFETs. Since our inception, we have developed IGBTs for high voltage applications. Our IGBTs, rated from 300 volts to 4,500 volts, are used principally in AC motor drives, power systems and defibrillators. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bipolar Products 
 Bipolar products are also used to process electricity, but are activated by current rather than voltage. Bipolar products are capable of switching electricity at substantially higher power levels than power MOS transistors. However, switching speeds of bipolar products are slower than those of power MOS transistors and, as a result, bipolar products are preferred where very high power is required. Our bipolar products consist of rectifiers and thyristors. 

 | Rectifiers. Rectifiers convert AC power to DC power and are used primarily in input and output rectification and inverters. Our rectifiers are used in DC and AC motor drives, power supplies, lighting and heating controls and welding equipment. A subset of our rectifier product group is a very fast switching device known as a FRED, or fast recovery epitaxial diode. FREDs limit spikes in voltage across the power switch to reduce power dissipation and electromagnetic interference. Our FREDs are used principally in AC motor drives and power supplies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5 
 

 | Thyristors. Thyristors are switches that can be turned on by a controlled signal and turned off only when the output current is reduced to zero, which occurs in the flow of AC power. Thyristors are preferred over power MOSFETs and IGBTs in high voltage, low frequency AC applications because their on-state resistance is lower than the on-state resistance of power MOSFETs and IGBTs. Our thyristors are used in motor drives, defibrillators, power supplies, lighting and heating controls. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrated Circuits 
 Our integrated circuits address the demand for analog, mixed-signal and digital interface solutions in communication and other industries and include microcontrollers, mixed-signal ASICs, as designed for specific customers and as standard products, and power management and control ICs. ICs accounted for 25.4% of our revenues in fiscal 2017, 26.5% of our revenues in fiscal 2016 and 28.2% of our revenues in fiscal 2015. 
Microcontrollers 
 A microcontroller is a computer-on-a-chip that is optimized to control electronic devices, such as motors and user interfaces on appliances. A microcontroller typically includes a central processing unit, non-volatile program memory, random access memory for data storage and various peripheral capabilities. The microcontroller includes application-specific software provided by customers and may include specialized peripheral device controllers and internal or external non-volatile memory components to enable the storage and access of additional program software. Our ZigBee® wireless microcontrollers offer system-on-a-chip, or SoC, solutions useful for home automation, smart energy and remote sensors. These ZigBee® wireless microcontrollers were acquired through the acquisition of RadioPulse, Inc., or RadioPulse, in May 2015. 
 Microcontroller devices have been incorporated into a wide variety of products in markets including consumer electronics, home appliances and security systems. Microcontrollers are generally segmented by word length, which is measured in bits ranging from 4-bit through 32-bit architectures. Our microcontroller product lines are focused on 8-bit microcontrollers. While traditional 16-bit and 32-bit architectures typically have higher performance, they can be too expensive for many high volume embedded control applications. Manufacturers will choose the appropriate microcontrollers based on cost, performance and functionality requirements. 
 Solid-State Relays 
 We manufacture solid-state relays, or SSRs, that isolate the low current communication signal from the higher power circuit, while also switching to control the flow of current. Our SSRs, which include high voltage analog components, optocouplers and integrated packages, are utilized principally in telecommunication and video and data communication applications, as well as instrumentation, industrial control and aerospace and automotive applications. 
 Application-Specific Integrated Circuits 
 We design high voltage, analog and mixed-signal ASICs for a variety of applications. Applying our technological expertise in ASICs, we also design and sell application-specific standard products. In this regard, we have developed a line of source and gate drivers. 
 Power Management and Control ICs 
 We also make and sell power management and control ICs, such as current regulators, motion controllers, digital power modulators and drivers for power MOSFETs and IGBTs. These ICs typically manage, control or regulate power semiconductors and the circuits and subassemblies that incorporate them. 
 RF Power Semiconductors 
 Our RF power devices switch electricity at the high rates necessary to enable the amplification or reception of radio frequencies. Our products include field-effect transistors, or FETs, pseudomorphic-high-electron-mobility transistors, or PHEMTs, Gunn diodes and monolithic microwave integrated circuits, or MMICs. These products are principally gallium arsenide devices, which remain efficient at the high heat and energy levels inherent in RF applications.

Our ICs are used to interface with telecommunication lines, control power semiconductors and drive medical equipment and displays, as well as offer our customers the ability to integrate peripheral functions such as network connectivity, timers, serial communication, analog-to-digital conversion and display drivers on our micrologic devices. Our RF power semiconductors enable the amplification and reception of radio frequencies in telecommunication, industrial, defense and space applications.

Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our products through a worldwide selling organization that includes direct sales personnel, independent representatives and distributors. As of March 31, 2017, we employed 77 people in sales, marketing and customer support and used 33 sales representative organizations and 15 distributors in the Americas and 152 sales representative organizations and distributors in the rest of the world. Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 58.7% of net revenues in fiscal 2017, 56.7% of net revenues in fiscal 2016 and 55.6% of net revenues in fiscal 2015. One distributor, Allied Group (Hong Kong), accounted for 12.3%, 12.2% and 10.2% of net revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Another distributor, Future Electronics, accounted for 10.8% and 10.5% of net revenues in fiscal 2017 and 2015, respectively. 
 In fiscal 2017, United States sales represented approximately 25.3%, and international sales represented approximately 74.7%, of our net revenues. Of our international sales in fiscal 2017, approximately 39.0% were derived from sales in Europe and the Middle East, approximately 57.5% were derived from sales in the Asia Pacific region and approximately 3.5% were derived from sales in India and the rest of the world. For financial information about geographic areas for each of our last three fiscal years, see Note 15, Segment and Geographic Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. For a discussion of the risks attendant to our foreign operations, see Item 1A, Risk Factors-Our international operations expose us to material risks, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. 
 We market our products through advertisements, technical articles and press releases that appear regularly in a variety of trade publications, as well as through the dissemination of brochures, data sheets and technical manuals. We also have a presence on the internet through a worldwide web page that enables engineers to access and download technical information and data sheets. 
 Research and Development 
 We believe that we successfully compete in our markets, in part because of our ability to design, develop and introduce new products offering technological improvements to the market on a timely basis. While the time from initiation of design to volume production of new semiconductors often takes 18 months or longer, our power semiconductors typically have a product life of several years. Our research and development expenses were approximately $30.5 million in fiscal 2017, $30.0 million in fiscal 2016 and $26.7 million in fiscal 2015. As of March 31, 2017, we employed 162 people in engineering and research and development activities. 
 We are engaged in ongoing research and development efforts focused on enhancements to existing products and the development of new products. Currently, we are pursuing research and development projects with respect to the following:

 Research and development activities are conducted in collaboration with manufacturing activities to help expedite new products from the development phase to manufacturing and to more quickly implement new process technologies. From time to time, our research and development efforts have included participation in technology collaborations with universities and research institutions. 
 Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights 
 As of March 31, 2017, we held 462 issued patents, of which 314 were issued in the U.S. and 148 were issued in international jurisdictions. We rely on a combination of patent rights, copyrights and trade secrets to protect the proprietary elements of our products. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. We also seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology, in part through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. While we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable, we also believe that other factors, such as innovative skills, technical expertise, the ability to adapt quickly to evolving customer requirements and new technologies, product support and customer relations, are of greater competitive significance. 
Manufacturing and Facilities 
 The production of our products is a highly complex and precise process. We manufacture our products in our own manufacturing facilities, utilize external wafer foundries and subcontract assembly facilities. We divide our manufacturing operations into three key areas: wafer fabrication, assembly and test. 
Wafer Fabrication 
 The first step in our manufacturing process for our power semiconductors is the deposition of a layer of epitaxy on the substrates we purchase from third parties. This deposition occurs at external facilities and at our facility in Santa Clara, California. The substrates are then sent for fabrication. 
 We have four facilities which perform fabrication: in Lampertheim, Germany, we fabricate bipolar products; in Beverly, Massachusetts, we manufacture HVICs; in Fremont, California, we manufacture gallium arsenide RF power semiconductors; and in Chippenham, England, we fabricate very high power bipolar devices. We believe that our internal fabrication capabilities enable us to more quickly bring products to the market, retain certain proprietary aspects of our process technology and develop new innovations. 
 In addition to maintaining our own fabrication facilities, we have established alliances with selected foundries for wafer fabrication. This approach allows us to reduce substantial capital spending and manufacturing overhead expenses, obtain competitive pricing and technologies and expand manufacturing capacity more rapidly than could be achieved with internal foundries alone. In some cases, we retain the 
 
9 
 
 flexibility to shift the production of our products to different or additional foundries for cost or performance reasons. Our product designs enable the production of our devices at multiple foundries using well-established and cost-effective processes. 
 Measured in dollars, we relied on external foundries for approximately 47.4% of our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2017. We have arrangements with a number of external wafer foundries, both for power semiconductors and ICs. Commonly, we provide our foundries forecasts for wafer fabrication six months in advance and make firm purchase commitments one to two months in advance of delivery. 
 Wafer fabrication of power semiconductors generally employs process technology and equipment already proven in IC manufacturing. Power semiconductors are manufactured using fabrication equipment that is one or more generations behind the equipment used to fabricate leading-edge ICs. Used fabrication equipment can be obtained at prices substantially less than the original cost of such equipment or the cost of current equipment applying the latest technology. Consequently, the fabrication of power semiconductors is less capital intensive than the fabrication of leading-edge ICs. 
 For a discussion of risks attendant to our use of external foundries, see Risk Factors-We depend on external foundries to manufacture many of our products, provided in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. For a discussion of risks attendant to our acquisition of substrates prior to wafer fabrication, see Risk Factors-We depend upon a limited number of suppliers for our substrates, most of whom we do not have long term agreements with, provided in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. For a discussion of environmental risks attendant to our business, see Risk Factors-We may be affected by environmental laws and regulations, provided in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. 
 Assembly 
 Packaging, or assembly, refers to the sequence of production steps that divide the wafer into individual die and enclose the dice in external structures, called packages, which make them useable in a circuit. Manufacturing typically involves the assembly and packaging of single semiconductor, or die, devices. Module manufacturing involves the assembly of multiple devices within a single package. SSR products involve multiple die assembly on a specialized lead frame. The resulting packages vary in configuration, but all have leads that are used to mount the package through holes in the customers printed circuit boards. 
 Most of our wafers are sent to subcontract assembly facilities. We use assembly subcontractors located in Asia and Europe in order to take advantage of low assembly costs. Measured in dollars, approximately 65.6% of our products were, during fiscal 2017, assembled at external assembly facilities, and the rest were assembled in our Lampertheim, Chippenham and Fremont facilities. 
 Test 
 Generally, each die on our wafers is electrically tested for performance after wafer fabrication. Following assembly, our products undergo testing and final inspection, either internally or externally, prior to shipment to customers. Our test operations are performed by subcontractors located throughout Asia and at our facilities in the United States and Europe. 
Competition 
 The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by price competition, technological change, limited fabrication capacity, international competition and manufacturing yield problems. The competitive factors in the market for our products include: 

 | price;
--+-------


 | product quality, reliability and performance;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | product features;
--+------------------


 | timely delivery of products;
--+-----------------------------

 
10 
 

 | proper new product definition;
--+-------------------------------


 | breadth of product line;
--+-------------------------


 | design and introduction of new products;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | market acceptance of our products and those of our customers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | support tools;
--+---------------


 | familiarity with micrologic architecture;
--+------------------------------------------


 | existing customer investment in system software based on a particular architecture; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | technical support and service.
--+-------------------------------

 Regarding these factors, we view our competitive advantage as an ability to respond quickly to customer requests for new product development. On the other hand, we rarely consider our company to be among the most aggressive in pricing. We believe that we are one of a limited group of companies focused on the development and marketing of high power, high performance semiconductors capable of performing all of the basic functions of power semiconductor design and manufacture. Our primary power semiconductor competitors include Fuji, Hitachi, Infineon, Microsemi, Mitsubishi, On Semiconductor, Powerex, Renesas Electronics, Semikron International, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba and Vishay Intertechnology. Our IC products compete principally with those of Cypress Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors, Microchip Technology, NEC, Renesas Electronics and Silicon Labs. Our RF power semiconductor competitors include Microsemi and Qorvo. 
 Backlog 
 Backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. In the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. Purchase orders or agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or, as a matter of industry practice, often not enforced. Therefore, a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable. For these reasons, the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results. At March 31, 2017, our backlog of orders was approximately $98.9 million as compared to $87.7 million at March 31, 2016. Backlog represents existing customer orders that, by their terms, are expected to be shipped within the 12 months following March 31, 2017. 
 Our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders that are booked months in advance of delivery. Generally, prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking. 
 We sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with just-in-time principles while shortening the cycle times required to produce ordered product. However, these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demand and periodic price renegotiations. 
 Employees 
 At March 31, 2017, we employed 1,003 employees, of whom 162 were primarily engaged in engineering and research and development activities, 77 in marketing, sales and customer support, 680 in manufacturing and 84 in finance and administration. Of these employees, 230 hold engineering or science degrees, including 33 Ph.D.s. Certain employees at our Lampertheim and Chippenham facilities are subject to collective bargaining agreements. There have been no work stoppages at any of our facilities to date. We believe that our employee relations are good. 
Seasonality 
 Over the years, we have experienced a pattern, although not consistently, in our September and December quarters of reduced revenues or reduced growth in revenues from quarter to sequential quarter because of summer vacation and year-end holiday schedules in our and our customers facilities, particularly in our European operations.

 Item 1A.    Risk Factors
In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not serious may also impair our business and its financial condition. 
 Our operating results fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
 Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, as well as macroeconomic uncertainties, we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations. Large portions of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenues could seriously negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. For example, from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, net income in one year shifted to net loss in the next year. Some of the factors that may affect our quarterly and annual results are: 
 

 | changes in business and economic conditions, including a downturn in demand or decrease in the rate of growth in demand, whether in the global economy, a regional economy or the semiconductor industry;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | changes in market conditions, potentially including changes in the credit markets, currency exchange rates, expectations for inflation or energy prices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the reduction, rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fluctuations in timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | changes in the mix of products that our customers purchase;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | changes in the level of customers component inventories;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | loss of key customers or employees;
--+------------------------------------


 | the availability of production capacity, whether internally or from external suppliers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry;
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | competitive pressures on selling prices;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | strategic actions taken by our competitors;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fluctuations in our manufacturing yields and significant yield losses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | difficulties in forecasting demand for our products and the planning and managing of inventory levels;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the availability of raw materials, supplies and manufacturing services from third parties;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the amount and timing of investments in research and development;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | damage awards or injunctions as the result of litigation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | changes in our product distribution channels and the timeliness of receipt of distributor resale information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
12 
 

 | the impact of vacation schedules and holidays, largely during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the amount and timing of costs associated with product returns.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result of these factors, many of which are difficult to control or predict, as well as the other risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may experience materially adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. Changes in demand for our products and in our customers product needs could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, and, in certain cases, may reduce our revenues, increase our costs, lower our gross margin percentage or require us to recognize impairments of our assets. If product demand declines, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to record an impairment on our long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets and goodwill, which would increase our expenses. Factory planning decisions may also shorten the useful lives of long-lived assets, including facilities and equipment, and cause us to accelerate depreciation. In addition, if product demand declines or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record underutilization charges, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. 
 Our backlog may not result in future revenues. 
 Customer orders typically can be cancelled or rescheduled by the customer without penalty to the customer. Cancellations or reschedulings are common in periods of decreasing demand. Further, in periods of increasing demand, particularly when production is allocated or delivery delayed, customers of semiconductor companies have on occasion placed orders without expectation of accepting delivery to increase their share of allocated product or in an effort to improve the timeliness of delivery. While we are attuned to the potential for such behavior and attempt to identify such orders, we could accept orders of this nature and subsequently experience order cancellation unexpectedly. 
 Our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenues for any succeeding period. A reduction of backlog during any particular period, or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenues, could harm our results of operations. 
 Fluctuations in the mix of products sold may adversely affect our financial results. 
 Changes in the mix and types of products sold may have a substantial impact on our revenues and gross profit margins. In addition, more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development costs and higher start-up costs. Fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover our fixed costs and investments that are associated with a particular product or wafer foundry, and, as a result, can negatively impact our financial results. 
 Our international operations expose us to material risks. 
 For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, our net revenues by region were approximately 25.3% in the United States, approximately 29.1% in Europe and the Middle East, approximately 42.9% in the Asia Pacific region and approximately 2.7% in India and the rest of the world. We expect net revenues from foreign markets to continue to represent a majority of total net revenues. We maintain significant business operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, or UK, the Philippines and South Korea and work with subcontractors, suppliers and manufacturers in South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and elsewhere in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Some of the risks inherent in doing business internationally are: 
 

 | foreign currency fluctuations, particularly in the Euro and the British pound;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | longer payment cycles;
--+-----------------------


 | challenges in collecting accounts receivable;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | changes in the laws, regulations or policies of the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products, including the present or future impact of the departure of the UK from the European Union;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
13 
 

 | trade restrictions, tariffs, customs, sanctions, embargoes and other barriers to importing/exporting materials and products in a cost effective and timely manner, or changes in applicable tariffs or custom rules;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cultural and language differences;
--+-----------------------------------


 | employment regulations;
--+------------------------


 | limited infrastructure in emerging markets;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | transportation delays;
--+-----------------------


 | seasonal reduction in business activities;
--+-------------------------------------------


 | work stoppages;
--+----------------


 | labor and union disputes;
--+--------------------------


 | electrical outages;
--+--------------------


 | terrorist attack or war; and
--+-----------------------------


 | economic or political instability.
--+-----------------------------------

 Our sales of products manufactured in our Lampertheim, Germany facility and our costs at that facility are primarily denominated in Euros, and sales of products manufactured in our Chippenham, UK facility and our costs at that facility are primarily denominated in British pounds. Fluctuations in the value of the Euro and the British pound against the U.S. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our balance sheet and results of operations. Brexit, the expected exit by the UK from the European Union, has, and in the future may, affect the value of the British pound and the Euro relative to one another and to the U.S. dollar. We generally do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize currency fluctuation risks. Reductions in the value of the Euro or British pound would reduce our revenues recognized in U.S. dollars, all other things being equal. Changes in the value of the Euro or the British pound could cause or increase losses associated with foreign currency transactions. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become more expensive to customers in a particular country, leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country. Alternatively, fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the face of competitive pricing pressures could lead to lower gross profit margins, as customer prices in one currency fall relative to costs of production experienced in a different currency. If we expand our international operations or change our pricing practices to denominate prices in other foreign currencies, we could be exposed to even greater risks of currency fluctuations. 
 Our financial performance is dependent on economic stability and credit availability in international markets. Actions by governments to address deficits or sovereign or bank debt issues, particularly in Europe, could adversely affect gross domestic product or currency exchange rates in countries where we operate, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results. If our customers or suppliers are unable to obtain the credit necessary to fund their operations, we could experience increased bad debts, reduced product orders and interruptions in supplier deliveries leading to delays or stoppages in our production. Alternatively, governmental actions in China or other emerging markets to address economic problems, such as inflation, asset or other bubbles or the transfer of capital out of the country, could also adversely affect gross domestic product or the growth thereof and result in reduced product orders or increased bad debt expense for us. Brexit may result in additional tariffs on our products manufactured in the UK and sold elsewhere, resulting in competitive pricing pressures that may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 In addition, the laws and courts of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws and courts. Therefore, the risk of piracy of our technology and products may be greater when we manufacture or sell our products in certain foreign countries. 
 Our dependence on subcontractors to assemble and test our products subjects us to a number of risks, including an inadequate supply of products and higher materials costs. 
 We depend on subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products. The substantial majority of our products are assembled by subcontractors located outside of the United States. Assembly subcontractors 
 
14 
 
 generally work on narrow margins and have limited capital. We have encountered assembly subcontractors who have ceased or reduced production because of financial problems. We engage assembly subcontractors who operate while in insolvency proceedings or whose financial stability is uncertain. The unexpected cessation of production or reduction in production by one or more of our assembly subcontractors could adversely affect our production, our customer relations, our revenues and our financial condition. Our reliance on these subcontractors also involves the following significant risks: 
 

 | reduced control over delivery schedules and quality;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | limited or no warranties by subcontractors or other vendors on products supplied to us;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other factors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential misappropriation of our intellectual property; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | economic or political instability in foreign countries.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 These risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs, which would harm our profitability and customer relationships. 
 Further, we use only a limited number of subcontractors to assemble most of our products. If one or more of these key subcontractors experience financial, operational, production or quality assurance difficulties, we could experience a significant reduction or interruption in supply. Although we believe alternative subcontractors are available, our operating results could temporarily suffer until we engage one or more of those alternative subcontractors. Moreover, in engaging alternative subcontractors in exigent circumstances, our production costs could increase markedly. 
 We depend on external foundries to manufacture many of our products. 
 Of our net revenues for our fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, 47.4% came from wafers manufactured for us by a number of external foundries. In particular, the wafers for all of our microcontrollers are fabricated at external foundries. Our dependence on external foundries may grow. 
 Our relationships with our external foundries do not guarantee prices, delivery or lead times or wafer or product quantities sufficient to satisfy current or expected demand. Generally, these foundries manufacture our products on a purchase order basis. We provide these foundries with rolling forecasts of our production requirements. However, the ability of each foundry to provide wafers to us is limited by the foundrys available capacity. At any given time, these foundries could choose to prioritize capacity for their own use or other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us. If growth in demand for our products occurs, our external foundries may be unable or unwilling to allocate additional capacity to our needs, thereby limiting our revenue growth. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that these foundries will allocate sufficient capacity to satisfy our requirements. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will continue to do business with these or other foundries on terms as favorable as our current terms. If we are not able to obtain foundry capacity as required, our relationships with our customers could be harmed, we could be unable to fulfill contractual requirements and our revenues could be reduced or our growth limited. Moreover, even if we are able to secure foundry capacity, we may be required, either contractually or as a practical business matter, to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties or an adverse effect to the business relationship. The costs related to maintaining foundry capacity could be expensive and could harm our operating results. Other risks associated with our reliance on external foundries include: 
 

 | the lack of control over delivery schedules;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | the unavailability of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | limited control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential misappropriation of our intellectual property.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 
15 
 
Our requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the external foundries that manufacture our wafers and products. One or more of these external foundries may not continue to produce wafers for us or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products is based. If we are required to transition production from one foundry to another, we may make large last-time buys of product at the foundry that we are exiting, which could eventually result in substantial inventory write-offs if semiconductors are not sold or utilized. These circumstances could harm our ability to deliver our products or increase our costs. 
 Our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors, including our level of capacity utilization. 
 Semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment, leading to high fixed costs, including depreciation expense. We are limited in our ability to reduce fixed costs quickly in response to any shortfall in revenues. If we are unable to utilize our manufacturing, assembly and testing facilities at a high level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in lower gross margins. Increased competition and other factors may lead to price erosion, lower revenues and lower gross margins for us in the future. 
 We may not be successful in our acquisitions. 
 We have in the past made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of other technologies and companies. These acquisitions involve numerous risks, including: 
 

 | failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | diversion of managements attention during the acquisition process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | disruption of our ongoing business;
--+------------------------------------


 | the potential strain on our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | unanticipated expenses and potential delays related to integration of an acquired business;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the risk that we will be unable to develop or exploit acquired technologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the engineering risks inherent in transferring products from one wafer fabrication facility to another;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business with our own;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | difficulties in expanding our information technology systems or integrating disparate information technology systems to accommodate the acquired businesses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the challenges inherent in managing an increased number of employees and facilities and the need to implement appropriate policies, benefits and compliance programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired companys products or personnel or with altered sales terms or a changed distribution channel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | adverse effects on our relationships with suppliers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | the reduction in financial stability associated with the incurrence of debt or the use of a substantial portion of our available cash;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the costs associated with acquisitions, including amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and the integration of acquired operations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | assumption of known or unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | failure or fraud in pre-acquisition due diligence.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 
16 
 
We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully acquire other businesses or product lines or integrate them into our operations without substantial expense, delay in implementation or other operational or financial problems. 
 As a result of an acquisition, our financial results may differ from the investment communitys expectations in a given quarter. Further, if one or more of the foregoing risks materialize or market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or stock price could be negatively impacted. 
 Our success depends on our ability to manufacture our products efficiently. 
 We manufacture our products in facilities that are owned and operated by us, as well as in external wafer foundries and subcontract assembly facilities. The fabrication of semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process, and a substantial percentage of wafers could be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer could be nonfunctional as a result of, among other factors: 
 

 | contaminants in the manufacturing environment;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


 | manufacturing equipment failure; or
--+------------------------------------


 | wafer breakage.
--+----------------

 For these and other reasons, we could experience a decrease in manufacturing yields. Additionally, if we increase our manufacturing output, the additional demands placed on existing equipment and personnel or the addition of new equipment or personnel may lead to a decrease in manufacturing yields. As a result, we may not be able to cost-effectively expand our production capacity in a timely manner. 
 We order materials and commence production in advance of anticipated customer demand. Therefore, revenue shortfalls may also result in inventory write-downs. 
 We typically plan our production and inventory levels based on our own expectations for customer demand. Actual customer demand, however, can be highly unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly. In response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials, we order materials and production in advance of customer demand. This advance ordering and production may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write-downs if expected orders fail to materialize. 
 The semiconductor industry is cyclical, and an industry downturn could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Business conditions in the semiconductor industry may rapidly change from periods of strong demand and insufficient production to periods of weakened demand and overcapacity. The industry in general is characterized by: 
 

 | changes in product mix in response to changes in demand;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | alternating periods of overcapacity and production shortages, including shortages of raw materials supplies and manufacturing services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cyclical demand for semiconductors;
--+------------------------------------


 | significant price erosion;
--+---------------------------


 | variations in manufacturing costs and yields;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | rapid technological change and the introduction of new products: and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These factors could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. 
 
17 
 
If our goodwill, acquired intangible assets or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. 
 Under generally accepted accounting principles, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and we review our acquired intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill, acquired intangible assets or long-lived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. From time to time, we have recorded impairment charges and written down the value of goodwill or acquired intangible assets. For example, in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $1.4 million impairment charge relating to intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of RadioPulse. 
 Costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business. 
 Costs associated with unexpected product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) due to, for example, unanticipated problems in our manufacturing processes, include the costs of: 
 

 | writing off the value of inventory of defective products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | disposing of defective products;
--+---------------------------------


 | recalling defective products that have been shipped to customers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | providing product replacements for, or modifications to, defective products; and/or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | defending against litigation related to defective products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 These costs could be substantial and may, therefore, increase our expenses and lower our gross margin. In addition, our reputation with our customers or users of our products could be damaged as a result of such product defects and errata, and the demand for our products could be reduced. These factors could harm our financial results and the prospects for our business. 
 Semiconductors for inclusion in consumer products have shorter product life cycles. 
 We believe that consumer products are subject to shorter product life cycles, because of technological change, consumer preferences, trendiness and other factors, than other types of products sold by our customers. Shorter product life cycles result in more frequent design competitions for the inclusion of semiconductors in next generation consumer products, which may not result in design wins for us. Shorter product life cycles may lead to more frequent circumstances where sales of existing products are reduced or ended. 
 Uncertain global macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Uncertain global macroeconomic conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the United States, Europe, China and other parts of the world could adversely affect our customers and vendors, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These uncertainties, including, among other things, the impact of Brexit on the UK and the European Union, sovereign and foreign bank debt levels, the inability of national or international political institutions to effectively resolve economic or budgetary crises or issues, trade disputes or changes in trading rules and tariffs between nations, consumer confidence, unemployment levels, interest rates, availability of capital, fuel and energy costs, tax rates, and the threat or outbreak of terrorism or public unrest, could adversely impact our customers and vendors, which could adversely affect us. Recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change their terms of sales. We generally sell products to customers with credit payment terms. If customers cash flow or operating or financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment to us. Likewise, for similar reasons vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms. Any inability of current or potential customers to pay us for our products or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
18 
 
Economic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the United Kingdoms expected exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 The UK government has initiated a process to leave the European Union and to negotiate the terms of the UKs future relationship with the European Union. We face uncertainty regarding the impact of the expected exit of the UK from the European Union. Adverse consequences such as deterioration in global economic conditions, stability in global financial markets, volatility in currency exchange rates, new or increased tariffs or adverse changes in regulation of the cross-border agreements could have a negative impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our debt agreements contain certain restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business. 
 The agreements governing our debt contain, and any other future debt agreement we enter into may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, including, in each case subject to certain exceptions, restrictions on our ability to: 
 

 | incur additional indebtedness;
--+-------------------------------


 | grant liens;
--+-------------


 | consolidate, merge or sell our assets, unless specified conditions are met;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | acquire other business organizations;
--+--------------------------------------


 | make investments;
--+------------------


 | redeem or repurchase our stock; and
--+------------------------------------


 | change the nature of our business.
--+-----------------------------------

 In addition, our debt agreements contain financial covenants and additional affirmative and negative covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. If we are not able to comply with all of these covenants for any reason, some or all of our outstanding debt could become immediately due and payable and the incurrence of additional debt under the credit facilities provided by the debt agreements would not be allowed. If our cash is utilized to repay any outstanding debt, depending on the amount of debt outstanding, we could experience an immediate and significant reduction in working capital available to operate our business. Related to these risks, our lenders waived a default under our existing Revolving Credit Agreement caused by the leverage ratio, which compared total funded indebtedness as of March 31, 2016 to EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2016. The leverage ratio minimally exceeded the contractually agreed ratio that was effective at the time. As of March 31, 2017, we complied with all of the financial covenants. 
 As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be significantly restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, such as strategic acquisitions or joint ventures. 
 If we default on our Revolving Credit Agreement, most of our assets may become subject to security interests, which could lead to our lenders taking possession, selling or otherwise disposing of such assets, or to bankruptcy to forestall such actions. 
 We estimate tax liabilities, the final determination of which is subject to review by domestic and international taxation authorities. 
 We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. We are also subject to review and audit by both domestic and foreign taxation authorities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment and estimation. The provision for income taxes can be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to changes in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions, or interpretation of those changes. 
 
19 
 
 Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the authoritative guidance issued by Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, in connection with accounting for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, goodwill or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination is made. 
 Our intellectual property revenues are uncertain and unpredictable in timing and amount. 
 We are unable to discern a pattern in or otherwise predict the amount of any payments for the sale or licensing of intellectual property that we may receive. Consequently, we are unable to plan on the timing of intellectual property revenues and our results of operations may be adversely affected by a reduction in future estimated intellectual property revenues. 
 Our markets are subject to technological change and our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products. 
 The markets for our products are characterized by: 
 

 | changing technologies;
--+-----------------------


 | changing customer needs;
--+-------------------------


 | frequent new product introductions and enhancements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | increased integration with other functions; and
--+------------------------------------------------


 | product obsolescence.
--+----------------------

 To develop new products for our target markets, we must develop, gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost-effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise. Failure to do so could cause us to lose our competitive position and seriously impact our future revenues. 
 Products or technologies developed by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive. A fundamental shift in technologies in our product markets would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within the industry. 
 Our revenues are dependent upon our products being designed into our customers products. 
 Many of our products are incorporated into customers products or systems at the design stage. The value of any design win largely depends upon the customers decision to manufacture the designed product in production quantities, the commercial success of the customers product and the extent to which the design of the customers electronic system also accommodates incorporation of components manufactured by our competitors. In addition, our customers could subsequently redesign their products or systems so that they no longer require our products. The development of the next generation of products by our customers generally results in new design competitions for semiconductors, which may not result in design wins for us, potentially leading to reduced revenues and profitability. We may not achieve design wins or our design wins may not result in future revenues. 
 We could be harmed by intellectual property litigation. 
 As a general matter, the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We have been sued for purported patent infringement and have been accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. We also have certain indemnification obligations to customers and suppliers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products. We could incur substantial costs defending ourselves and our customers and suppliers from any such claim. Infringement claims or claims for indemnification, whether or not proven to be true, may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our core business operations and could otherwise harm our business. For example, in June 2000, we were sued for patent infringement by International Rectifier Corporation. The case was ultimately resolved in our favor, but not until October 2008. In the interim, the U.S. District Court entered multimillion dollar judgments against us on two different occasions, each of which was subsequently vacated. 
 
20 
 
In the event of an adverse outcome in any intellectual property litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the development, manufacturing, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third party claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations upon us. An adverse outcome in an infringement action could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately. 
 Our ability to compete is affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and non-disclosure and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite these efforts, we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or that our competitors will not independently develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to our technology. More specifically, we cannot assure that our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved, or that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties. Nor can we assure that, if challenged, our patents will be found to be valid or enforceable, or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business. We may also become subject to or initiate patentability or interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which can demand significant financial and management resources and could harm our financial results. Also, others may independently develop similar products or processes, duplicate our products or processes or design their products around any patents that may be issued to us. 
 Because our products typically have lengthy sales cycles, we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenues. 
 The time from initiation of design to volume production of new semiconductors often takes 18 months or longer. We first work with customers to achieve a design win, which may take nine months or longer. Our customers then complete the design, testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production, a period that may last an additional nine months or longer. As a result, a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenues, if any, from volume purchasing of our products by our customers. 
 The markets in which we participate are intensely competitive. 
 Many of our target markets are intensely competitive. Our ability to compete successfully in our target markets depends on the following factors: 
 

 | proper new product definition;
--+-------------------------------


 | product quality, reliability and performance;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | product features;
--+------------------


 | price;
--+-------


 | timely delivery of products;
--+-----------------------------


 | technical support and service;
--+-------------------------------


 | design and introduction of new products;
--+-----------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | breadth of product line.
--+-------------------------

 In addition, our competitors or customers may offer new products based on new technologies, industry standards, end-user or customer requirements, including products that have the potential to replace our products or provide lower cost or higher performance alternatives to our products. The introduction of new products by our competitors or customers could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable. 
 Our primary power semiconductor competitors include Fuji, Hitachi, Infineon, Microsemi, Mitsubishi, On Semiconductor, Powerex, Renesas Electronics, Semikron International, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba and Vishay 
 
21 
 
 Intertechnology. Our IC products compete principally with those of Cypress Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors, Microchip Technology, NEC, Renesas Electronics and Silicon Labs. Our RF power semiconductor competitors include Microsemi and Qorvo. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and management resources than we have. Some of these competitors may be able to sell their products at prices at which it would be unprofitable for us to sell our products or benefit from established customer relationships that provide them with a competitive advantage. We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition. 
 We rely on our distributors and sales representatives to sell many of our products. 
 Most of our products are sold to distributors or through sales representatives. Our distributors and sales representatives could reduce or discontinue sales of our products. They may not devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect. In addition, we depend upon the continued viability and financial resources of these distributors and sales representatives, some of which are small organizations with limited working capital. These distributors and sales representatives, in turn, depend substantially on general economic conditions and conditions within the semiconductor industry. We believe that our success will continue to depend upon these distributors and sales representatives. Foreign distributors are typically granted longer payment terms, resulting in higher accounts receivable balances for a given level of sales than domestic distributors. Our risk of loss from the financial insolvency of distributors is, therefore, disproportionally weighted to foreign distributors. If any significant distributor or sales representative experiences financial difficulties, or otherwise becomes unable or unwilling to promote and sell our products, our business could be harmed. For example, All American Semiconductor, Inc., one of our former distributors, filed for bankruptcy in April 2007. 
 Our future success depends on the continued service of management and key engineering personnel and our ability to identify, hire and retain additional personnel. 
 Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and finance personnel, and, to a significant extent, upon the efforts and abilities of Nathan Zommer, Ph.D. and Uzi Sasson, our Chief Executive Officers, and other members of senior management. The loss of the services of one or more of our senior management or other key employees could adversely affect our business. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers, employees or consultants. There is intense competition for qualified employees in the semiconductor industry, particularly for highly skilled design, application and test engineers. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified individuals who could leave us at any time in the future. If we grow, we expect increased demands on our resources, and growth would likely require the addition of new management and engineering staff as well as the development of additional expertise by existing management. If we lose the services of or fail to recruit key engineers or other technical and management personnel, our business could be harmed. 
 Acquisitions, expansion, technological and administrative changes and software conversions and updates place a significant strain on our information systems. 
 Presently, because of our acquisitions, we are operating a number of different information systems that are not integrated, some of which are no longer supported by software vendors. As a consequence, we use spreadsheets, which are prepared by individuals rather than automated systems, in our accounting. We perform many manual reconciliations and other manual steps, which result in a high risk of errors. Manual steps also increase the possibility of control deficiencies and material weaknesses. 
 If we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes, our ability to manage or grow our business may be harmed. Our ability to successfully implement our goals and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management system and process. We will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively in the future. 
 
22 
 
In improving, consolidating, changing or updating our operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, we would expect to periodically implement new or different software and other systems that will affect our internal operations regionally or globally. The conversion process from one system to another is complex and could require, among other things, that data from the existing system be made compatible with the upgraded or different system. 
 In connection with any of the foregoing, we could experience errors, interruptions, delays, cessations of service and other inefficiencies, which could adversely affect our business. Any error, delay, disruption, interruption or cessation, including with respect to any new or different systems, software programs, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to forecast sales demand, manage our supply chain, achieve accuracy in the conversion of electronic data and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. In addition, as we add or change functionality, transition or convert to different systems or programs or integrate additional data in connection with an acquisition, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner: provide quotes; take customer orders; ship products; provide services and support to our customers; bill and track our customers; fulfill contractual obligations; and otherwise run our business. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in the diversion of managements attention and resources, adversely affect our ability to manage our business, increase expenses, or adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, stock price or reputation. 
 System security risks, data protection breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation or adversely affect our stock price. 
 Computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our intellectual property or other confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. 
 We manage and store proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and the businesses of third parties. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our partners or customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our partners and customers to a risk of loss or misuse of this information; result in regulatory investigations, fines, litigation and potential liability for us; damage our brand and reputation; or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. 
 Regulations related to conflict minerals create additional compliance risks and force us to incur additional expenses. 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo, or DRC, and adjoining countries. As a result, the SEC established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products. As a result, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain minerals at competitive prices. Moreover, there are additional costs associated with complying with the extensive due diligence and audit procedures required by the SEC. In addition, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders as we have in the past and may in the future be unable to sufficiently verify the 
 
23 
 
 origins of all minerals used in our products. Finally, these rules bring implementation challenges. We may not successfully implement effective procedures to timely or adequately comply with these rules. 
 We depend on a limited number of suppliers for our substrates, most of whom we do not have long term agreements with. 
 We purchase the bulk of our silicon substrates from a limited number of vendors, most of whom we do not have long term supply agreements with. Any of these suppliers could reduce or terminate our supply of silicon substrates at any time. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks, including potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of silicon substrates and reduced control over the price, timely delivery, reliability and quality of the silicon substrates. We cannot assure that problems will not occur in the future with suppliers. 
 Increasing raw material prices could impact our profitability. 
 Our products use large amounts of silicon, metals and other materials. From time to time, we have experienced price increases for many of these items. If we are unable to pass price increases for raw materials onto our customers, our gross margins and profitability could be adversely affected. 
 We may not be able to increase production capacity to meet the present and future demand for our products. 
 The semiconductor industry has been characterized by periodic limitations on production capacity. These limitations may result in longer lead times for product delivery than desired by many of our customers. If we are unable to increase our production capacity to meet future demand, some of our customers may seek other sources of supply, our future growth may be limited or our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 We face the risk of financial exposure to product liability claims alleging that the use of products that incorporate our semiconductors resulted in adverse effects. 
 Approximately 10.2% of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 were derived from sales of products used in medical devices, such as defibrillators. Product liability risks may exist even for those medical devices that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale. We cannot be sure that the insurance that we maintain against product liability will be adequate to cover our losses. Any defects in our semiconductors used in these devices, or in any other product, could result in significant product liability costs to us. 
 Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. 
 The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations (see Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K). Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations. 
 We are exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment. 
 We are subject to various risks related to new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate; disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies; and the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. If we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 In addition, approximately 10.2% of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 were derived from the sale of products included in medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and internationally, including the U.S. Food and Drug 
 
24 
 
 Administration, or FDA. The FDA and certain foreign regulatory authorities impose numerous requirements for medical device manufacturers to meet, including adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, regulations and similar regulations in other countries, which include testing, control and documentation requirements. Ongoing compliance with GMP and other applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic inspections by federal and state agencies, including the FDA, and by comparable agencies in other countries. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could prevent our products from being included in approved medical devices or result in damages or other compensation payable to medical device manufacturers. 
 Our business could also be harmed by delays in receiving or the failure to receive required approvals or clearances, the loss of obtained approvals or clearances or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements. 
 We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may need to record impairments in the value of the investments. 
 We make investments in companies to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives. Such investments include investments in equity securities of public companies and investments in non-marketable equity securities of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support a product or initiative. The success of these companies is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency and other key business success factors. The private companies in which we invest may fail for operational reasons or because they may not be able to secure additional funding, obtain favorable investment terms for future financings or take advantage of liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers and private sales. If any of these private companies fail, we could lose all or part of our investment in that company. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for the equity securities of the public and private companies in which we invest, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss. Furthermore, when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved, or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives, we may decide to dispose of the investment, even at a loss. Our investments in non-marketable equity securities of private companies are not liquid, and we may not be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all. The occurrence of any of these events could negatively affect our results of operations. 
 Our ability to access capital markets could be limited. 
 From time to time, we may need to access the capital markets to obtain long-term financing. Although we believe that we can continue to access the capital markets on acceptable terms and conditions, our flexibility with regard to long-term financing activity could be limited by our existing capital structure, our credit ratings and the health of the semiconductor industry. In addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access the capital markets, such as the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the current state of the economy, are outside of our control. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on favorable terms. 
 Geopolitical instability, war, terrorist attacks and terrorist threats, and government responses thereto, may negatively affect many aspects of our operations, revenues, costs and stock price. 
 Any such event may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers. Our markets currently include South Korea, Taiwan, Russia and Israel, which are currently experiencing political instability. Additionally, we have accounting and administrative operations in the Philippines, an external foundry and some of our design and sales operations are located in South Korea and assembly subcontractors are located in Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea. 
 Business interruptions may damage our facilities or those of our suppliers. 
 Our operations and those of our suppliers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, flood and other natural disasters, as well as power loss, telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control. We do 
 
25 
 
 not have a detailed disaster recovery plan and our backup power sources have only a limited amount of time for the support of critical systems. Our facilities in California are located near major earthquake fault lines and have experienced earthquakes in the past. Globally, for example, the March 2011 earthquake in Japan adversely affected the operations of some of our Japanese suppliers, which limited the availability of certain production inputs to us for a period of time. If a natural disaster occurs, our ability to conduct our operations could be seriously impaired, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. We cannot be sure that the insurance we maintain against general business interruptions will be adequate to cover all our losses. 
 We may be affected by environmental laws and regulations. 
 We are subject to a variety of laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing process. Any of those regulations could require us to acquire expensive equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with them. If we incur substantial additional expenses, product costs could significantly increase. Failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could result in fines, suspension of production or cessation of operations. 
 Nathan Zommer, Ph.D. owns a significant interest in our common stock. 
 Nathan Zommer, Ph.D., our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned, as of May 23, 2017, approximately 20.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, Dr. Zommer can exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of the Board of Directors. His holdings could result in a delay of, or serve as a deterrent to, any change in control of our company, which may reduce the market price of our common stock. 
 Our stock price is volatile. 
 The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly to date. The future market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly in the event of: 
 

 | variations in our actual or expected quarterly operating results;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | announcements or introductions of new products;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | technological innovations by our competitors or development setbacks by us;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | conditions in semiconductor markets;
--+-------------------------------------


 | the commencement or adverse outcome of litigation;
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | changes in analysts estimates of our performance or changes in analysts forecasts regarding our industry, competitors or customers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | announcements of merger or acquisition transactions or a failure to achieve the expected benefits of an acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by participants in the stock market;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | terrorist attack or war;
--+-------------------------


 | sales of our common stock by one or more members of management, including Nathan Zommer, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | general economic and market conditions.
--+----------------------------------------

 In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies, including semiconductor companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies in our industry, and could harm the market price of our common stock. 
 The anti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and of the Delaware General Corporation Law may delay, defer or prevent a change of control. 
 Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any 
 
26 
 
 further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be harmed by, the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may delay, defer or prevent a change in control because the terms of any issued preferred stock could potentially prohibit our consummation of any merger, reorganization, sale of substantially all of our assets, liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction, without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. 
 Our stockholders must give substantial advance notice prior to the relevant meeting to nominate a candidate for director or present a proposal to our stockholders at a meeting. These notice requirements could inhibit a takeover by delaying stockholder action. The Delaware anti-takeover law restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires 15% or more of our common stock. The Delaware statute makes it more difficult for us to be acquired without the consent of our Board of Directors and management.
