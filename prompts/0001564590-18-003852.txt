Company Overview 
 Grubhub Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company,” “Grubhub,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) is the leading online and mobile platform for restaurant pick-up and delivery orders, which the Company refers to as takeout. The Company connects more than 80,000 local restaurants with hungry diners in more than 1,600 cities across the United States and is focused on transforming the takeout experience. For restaurants, Grubhub generates higher margin takeout orders at full menu prices. The Grubhub platform empowers diners with a “direct line” into the kitchen, avoiding the inefficiencies, inaccuracies and frustrations associated with paper menus and phone orders. The Company has a powerful two-sided network that creates additional value for both restaurants and diners as it grows. 
 For restaurants, takeout enables them to grow their business without adding seating capacity or wait staff. Advertising for takeout, typically done through the distribution of menus to local households or advertisements in local publications, is often inefficient and requires upfront payment with no certainty of success. In contrast, Grubhub provides restaurants on its platform with an efficient way to generate more takeout orders. Grubhub enables restaurants to access local diners at the moment when those diners are hungry and ready to purchase takeout. In addition, the Company does not charge the restaurants in its takeout marketplace any upfront or subscription fees, does not require any discounts from their full price menus and only gets paid for the orders the Company generates for them, providing restaurants with a low-risk, high-return solution. The Company charges restaurants a per-order commission that is primarily percentage-based. In many markets, the Company also provides delivery services to restaurants on its platform that do not have their own delivery operations. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was providing delivery services in more than 80 markets across the country. 
 For diners, the traditional takeout ordering process is often a frustrating experience—from using paper menus to communicating an order by phone to a busy restaurant employee. In contrast, ordering on Grubhub is enjoyable and a dramatic improvement over the “menu drawer.” The Company provides diners on the platform with an easy-to-use, intuitive and personalized platform that helps them search for and discover local restaurants and then accurately and efficiently place an order from any Internet-connected device. Grubhub also provides diners with information and transparency about their orders and status and solves problems that may arise. In addition, the Company makes re-ordering convenient by storing previous orders, preferences and payment information, helping to promote diner frequency and drive strong repeat business.
 The Company generates revenues primarily when diners place an order on its platform. Restaurants pay a commission, typically a percentage of the transaction on orders that are processed through the Company’s platform. Most of the restaurants on the Company’s platform can choose their level of commission rate, at or above the base rate. A restaurant can choose to pay a higher rate, which affects its prominence and exposure to diners on the platform. Additionally, restaurants that use the Company’s delivery services pay an additional commission on the transaction for the use of those services. The Company also recognizes as revenue any fees charged to the diner for delivery services it provides. For most orders, diners use a credit card to pay the Company for their meal when the order is placed. For these transactions, the Company collects the total amount of the diner’s order net of payment processing fees from the payment processor and remits the net proceeds to the restaurant less commission. The Company generally accumulates funds and remits the net proceeds to the restaurants on at least a monthly basis. The Company also deducts commissions for other transactions that go through its platform, such as cash transactions for restaurants partners, from the aggregate proceeds received. Additionally, the Company provides consolidated invoicing for its corporate program customers generally on a monthly basis.

Organization 
 Grubhub was founded in 2004 and Seamless was founded in 1999. The merger of Grubhub Holdings Inc., Seamless North America, LLC, and Seamless Holdings Corporation was completed on August 8, 2013 (the “Merger”). The Merger enabled the Company to expand its two-sided network, connecting customers in the geographies it serves with more restaurants. The Merger also enabled the Company to eliminate duplicative expenses and take advantage of a complementary geographic footprint. 
 On April 4, 2014, the Company completed an initial public offering (the “IPO”) and its common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “GRUB”.
 Acquisitions of Business and Other Intangible Assets

Diner Benefits 
 With 14.5 million Active Diners as of December 31, 2017 and more than 334,000 combined Daily Average Grubs during the year ended December 31, 2017, management believes that Grubhub provides diners with the following key benefits:

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenges
 The Company faces several key challenges in continuing to grow its business and maintaining profitability. These challenges include that: 
  
• | long-term growth depends on the Company’s ability to continue to expand its takeout marketplace of restaurants and diners in a cost-effective manner;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability to realize the benefits of the investment in the Company’s delivery network depends on the efficient utilization and expansion of such network;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability to realize the benefits of acquired businesses depends on the successful integration of the operations of the acquired businesses with those of the Company; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | while the Company’s primary competition remains the traditional offline takeout ordering method, new competitors could emerge and existing competitors could gain traction in the Company’s markets. These competitors may have greater resources and other advantages than Grubhub and could impact the Company’s growth rates and ability to maintain profitability.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Factors Affecting Performance 
  
• | The Size of the Company’s Takeout Marketplace. Grubhub’s growth has come, and is expected to continue to come, from the Company’s ability to successfully expand its takeout marketplace, which occurs through the growth of the number of restaurants and diners on the platform. The Company believes that increases in the number of restaurants will make the platform more attractive to diners and increases in the number of diners will make the platform more attractive to
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5

 
restaurants. Furthermore, the number of popular restaurants in each local market is an important factor in making the platform more attractive to diners.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seasonality. In metropolitan markets, the Company generally experiences a relative increase in diner activity from September to April and a relative decrease in diner activity from May to August. In addition, the Company benefits from increased order volumes in campus markets when school is in session and experiences a decrease in order volumes when school is not in session (during summer breaks and other vacation periods).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Weather. Diner activity can also be impacted by colder or more inclement weather, which typically increases order volumes, and warmer or sunny weather, which typically decreases order volumes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Products and Services 
 The following is a list of the Company’s primary products and services. The Company’s primary revenues are the commissions earned from restaurants for consumer orders generated on its platform. 
Products 
 Grubhub, Seamless and Eat24 Mobile Apps and Mobile Website
 The Company offers diners access to the platform through its mobile applications designed for iPhone®, Android™, iPad®, Amazon Alexa® and Apple TV® devices. To use the mobile applications, diners either enter their delivery address or use geo-location and are presented with local restaurants that provide takeout. Diners can further refine their search results using the search capability, enabling them to filter results across cuisine types, restaurant names, menu items, proximity, ratings and other criteria. Once diners have found what they are looking for, they place their orders using easy-to-use and intuitive menus, enabling them to discover food choices, select options and provide specific instructions on a dish-by-dish basis. Once an order is received, the Company transmits it to the restaurant, while saving the diners’ preferences for future orders, thus providing diners with a convenient repeat order experience. Diners can also access the platform from their mobile devices through the mobile website using any mobile browser. 
Grubhub, Seamless and Eat24 Websites 
 Diners can access the platform through www.grubhub.com, www.seamless.com and www.eat24.com. The websites provide diners with the same functionality as the Company’s mobile applications, including restaurant discovery, search and ordering. For restaurants, all website-based orders are received in the same way as the mobile orders, and the Company charges the same commission for both.
Corporate Program 
 The Company provides a corporate program that helps businesses address inefficiencies in food ordering and associated billing. The corporate program offers employees a wide variety of food and ordering options, including options for individual meals, group ordering and catering, as well as proprietary tools that consolidate all food ordering into a single online account that enables companies to proactively manage food spend by automating the enforcement of budgets and rules. The corporate tools provide consolidated ordering and invoicing, eliminating the need for employee expense reports and therefore significantly reducing administrative overhead relating to office food ordering. 
Delivery 
 The Company offers delivery services to restaurants in many of its markets. By providing delivery services, the Company is able to significantly broaden the number of restaurants it can offer to diners while enhancing the transparency, consistency and reliability of the diner experience. Delivery services benefit the restaurants by allowing them to focus on making great food while Grubhub handles the complexity of operating the delivery networks. 
Grubhub for Restaurants
 Restaurants have historically received orders from Grubhub through a facsimile or email and confirmed orders by phone. Though many restaurants on the Company’s platform still use this traditional method, a large portion of Grubhub’s restaurants use Grubhub for Restaurants, a responsive web application that can be accessed from computers and mobile devices, as well as Grubhub-provided tablets. Grubhub for Restaurants allows restaurants to electronically receive and display orders and provides operators with the capability to acknowledge receipt of the order, update the estimated completion time and status, specify driver pick-up times, monitor delivery status for delivery drivers in Grubhub’s network, update menu items and perform other administrative functions. Grubhub for Restaurants allows the Company to monitor orders throughout the takeout process (receipt, ready for pickup, on the way, etc.). In turn, Grubhub can make that information available to hungry diners who are waiting for their orders, thus providing greater transparency, reducing their frustration and making the takeout experience more enjoyable.
6

Point of Sale Integration 
 The Company also offers point of sale (“POS”) integration which allows restaurants to manage Grubhub orders and update their menus directly from their existing POS system, eliminating the need for additional devices. Grubhub has developed or is in the process of developing POS integrations with multiple major platforms including Oracle’s MICROS systems, NCR’s Aloha, RPOWER, Breadcrumb and Toast. These integrations help restaurants improve their in-store workflow, eliminate the time required to enter orders, create more transparency and potentially shorten the window between consumer order and meal preparation. 
Restaurant Websites 
 The Company offers the restaurants in its network a turnkey website design and hosting service powered by template-driven technology, which provides restaurant partners with a simple yet effective online presence. Grubhub processes the orders placed through these websites through its platforms. 
 Allmenus and MenuPages 
 Allmenus.com and MenuPages.com (“MenuPages”) provide an aggregated database of approximately 650,000 menus from restaurants across all 50 U.S. states. The websites are searchable by cuisine type, restaurant name, menu items and other criteria. For those restaurants whose menus are posted on allmenus.com or MenuPages and which are also part of the Company’s restaurant network, the sites provide a link from their menus to grubhub.com and seamless.com, as applicable, through which diners can then place their orders, providing the Company with an efficient customer acquisition channel. 
 
Customer Care 
 Restaurants 
 Customer care is an important component of Grubhub’s value proposition for restaurants, enabling them to focus on food preparation. The Company provides restaurants with 24/7 service, where representatives are able to assist with problems that may arise. The Company tracks and manages restaurant performance on the platform, helping restaurants manage capacity issues while ensuring that diners receive the service they expect. 
 In addition to operations-related services, the Company offers restaurants actionable insights based on the significant amount of order data the Company gathers, helping restaurants optimize their delivery footprint, menus, pricing and online profiles. 
 Diners 
 The customer care the Company offers to diners is also an important component of Grubhub’s value proposition, helping to generate diner satisfaction and positive word-of-mouth referrals. The Company believes that it is its responsibility to make diners happy. When diners contact the 24/7 customer care center, the Company typically helps them add items to orders that have already been placed and informs them of the status of their orders. The Company believes that its excellent customer care drives diner referrals, more frequent ordering and overall loyalty to the platform. 
Geographic Markets 
 The Company’s geographic reach included more than 1,600 cities across the United States as of December 31, 2017. The Company generally has greater market penetration in densely populated metropolitan cities in the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company also generated a nominal amount of foreign revenues through its U.K. subsidiary. 
Sales and Marketing 
 The Company’s sales team adds new restaurants to the network by emphasizing Grubhub’s low risk, high return proposition: providing more orders, without charging any upfront payments or subscription fees or requiring any discounts from a restaurant’s full price menus, and Grubhub only gets paid for orders it generates for them. The Company’s delivery network has also expanded the Company’s offerings and ability to attract restaurants that do not have their own delivery operations. Leads for new restaurants are generated either directly by the restaurant through the Company’s websites, including allmenus.com and MenuPages.com, or are self-prospected by the sales team. Once restaurants have joined the Company’s takeout marketplace, Grubhub representatives continue to work with them to maintain quality control and to increase their order volume. The sales team separately focuses on adding new corporate program clients by emphasizing Grubhub’s value proposition: a wide variety of ordering options for employees and proprietary tools that provide rule-based ordering and consolidated reporting and invoicing for employers. 
 7

The Company believes that its online ordering platform, innovative products and excellent customer care are its best and most effective marketing tools, helping to generate strong word-of-mouth referrals, which have been the primary driver of the Company’s diner growth. The Company’s integrated marketing efforts are aimed at encouraging new diners to try the platform and driving existing diners to engage more frequently with the platform. The Company uses both online as well as offline advertising. 
 Technology 
 The Company generally develops additional features for its platform in-house, focusing on quick release cycles and constant improvement. Grubhub’s web and mobile properties are either stored on secure remote servers and software networks through a public cloud provider or are hosted by a third-party provider of hosting services. The Company’s primary third-party hosting service providers are located in Illinois and Utah. The platform includes a variety of encryption, antivirus, firewall and patch-management technology to protect and maintain systems and computer hardware across the business. The Company relies on third-party off-the-shelf technology as well as internally developed and proprietary products and systems to ensure rapid, high-quality customer care, software development, website integration, updates and maintenance. The Company leverages off-the-shelf hardware and software platforms in order to build and customize its hardware-based products, such as tablets installed with the Grubhub for Restaurants application. 
Customers 
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company served approximately 14.5 million Active Diners and over 80,000 restaurants. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, none of these Active Diners or restaurants accounted for 1% or more of the Company’s net revenues. 
Competition 
 The Company primarily competes with the traditional offline ordering process used by the vast majority of restaurants and diners involving paper menus that restaurants distribute to diners, as well as advertising that restaurants place in local publications to attract diners. For diners, Grubhub competes with the traditional ordering process by aggregating restaurant and menu information in one place online so that it is easier and more convenient to find a desirable restaurant option and place a customized order without having to interact directly with the restaurants. For restaurants, the Company offers a more targeted marketing opportunity than the yellow pages, billboards or other local advertising mediums since diners typically access the Company’s platform when they are looking to place a takeout order, and Grubhub captures the transaction right when a diner has made a decision. 
 The Company’s online competition consists primarily of national and local service providers, point-of-sale module vendors that serve some independent restaurants who have their own standalone websites and the online interfaces of chain restaurants that also offer takeout. Compared to other online platforms, Grubhub offers diners a wide range of choices, with over 80,000 restaurants on the Company’s platform, including low cost or no cost delivery, menu price parity with any other online ordering option and full price transparency with no hidden fees. The Company also competes for diners with online competitors on the basis of convenience, control and customer care. For restaurants, Grubhub competes with other online platforms based on its ability to generate additional orders, manage challenges such as customization, change orders, menu updates and specials and the ability to help them improve their operational efficiency, with product innovations like Grubhub for Restaurants and POS integration, as well as providing a seamless diner experience. 
 Management believes the Company competes favorably based on these factors and its singular focus on connecting restaurants and diners for takeout ordering. Although paper menus are still the Company’s biggest competition, based on available information regarding the number of diners and restaurants on the platform and the number of orders processed through the platform, management believes Grubhub is the largest online provider of takeout orders in the United States for independent and chain restaurants. 
 Seasonality 
 The Company’s business is dependent on diner behavior patterns. In metropolitan markets, the Company generally experiences a relative increase in diner activity from September to April and a relative decrease in diner activity from May to August. In addition, the Company benefits from increased order volume in its campus markets when school is in session and experiences a decrease in order volume when school is not in session, during summer breaks and other vacation periods. Diner activity can also be impacted by colder or more inclement weather, which typically increases order volume, and warmer or sunny weather, which typically decreases order volume. Seasonality may cause fluctuations in the Company’s financial results on a quarterly basis.
