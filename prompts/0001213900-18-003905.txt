Item 1. | Business.
-------------------------------------------------+----------

Business Overview
 
We are engaged in the research and development, small production and sales of graphene and graphene oxide and graphite bipolar plates in the People’s Republic of China. We have developed our own graphene prototype and produces the products by orders only, for which we sell domestically and export internationally. We outsource the production of large orders to third parties as we have not commercialized our product prototype. We also operate a business-to-business and business-to-consumers Internet portal (www.roycarbon.com) for graphite related products.
 
Our business scope includes research and development, small production and selling primarily the following types of graphite products:
 

● | graphene; 
--+--------------------------
● | graphene oxide; 
● | carbon graphite felt; and
● | graphite bipolar plates 

Our Growth Strategy
 
Some of our future business plans, including promoting our online portal and potential acquisition and merger, would likely require us to obtain additional funds from equity or debt markets, or to borrow additional funds from local banks.  We currently have no commitments from any financing sources.  There is no assurance that we will be able to raise any funds on terms favorable to us, or at all.  In the event that we issue shares of equity or convertible securities, holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted.  In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage and integrate the production and sale of new products.
Organizational Structure
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on February 13, 2003 as Achievers Magazine Inc. On December 17, 2007, we completed a reverse merger with Talent International Investment Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on February 1, 2007 (“Talent”). Following the reverse merger, our name was changed to “China Carbon Graphite Group, Inc.”
 
As a result of the reverse merger, Talent became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Talent wholly owns Yongle, which is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise organized under the laws of the PRC. On December 14, 2007, Yongle executed a series of exclusive contractual agreements with Xingyong, an operating company organized under the laws of the PRC. Xingyong was founded in 1986 as a state-owned company and converted into a private enterprise in 2001.
 
PRC law currently has limits on foreign ownership of certain companies. To comply with these foreign ownership restrictions, we operated our businesses in the PRC through Xingyong. Xingyong has the licenses and approvals necessary to operate in the PRC. We had contractual agreements with Xingyong and its stockholders pursuant to which we had the ability to substantially influence Xingyong’s daily operations and financial affairs, appoint its senior executives and approve all matters requiring stockholder approval. As a result of our contractual agreements with Xingyong, we were able to control Xingyong.

Sale of Xingyong. On June 10, 2014, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) by and among the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Yongle (together with the Company, the “Sellers”), and Dengyong Jin and Benhua Du (collectively, the “Purchasers”).  Pursuant to the Agreement, the Purchasers purchased all of the rights and obligations of Yongle with relating to Xingyong under the Contractual Arrangements.  The Purchasers collectively hold 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Xingyong.  The purchase price under the Agreement was $1,543,734 (RMB 10 million), including $575,813 (RMB 3.73 million) in cash and the cancellation of the registrant’s repayment obligations of $967,921 (RMB 6.27 million) previously advanced by Dengyong Jin to the Company.   The Purchasers agreed to return all shares held individually and under Sincere Investment (PTC) Limited totaling 10,388,172 shares. The disposal of Xingyong became effective on June 30, 2014 after approved by majority of shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders held on such date. In connection with this transaction and as of December 31, 2016, Company has not received the $1,543,734 of the total purchase price and adjusted the note receivable as a bad debt expense. As of March 10, 2017, 9,388,172 shares of common stock previously held by Sincere were cancelled.
 
The Company’s results of operations related to Xingyong have since been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all periods presented.
 
Acquisition in December 2013
 
On December 23, 2013, we acquired Golden Ivy Limited, a British Virgin Island company (“BVI Co.”). Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition, we issued an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to the former shareholders of BVI Co. in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding equity of BVI Co. BVI Co. then became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The shares were issued on January 16, 2014.
 
BVI Co. currently has one business operation as follows (the “Business”):
 

● | A business-to-business and business-to-consumers Internet portal (www.roycarbon.com) for graphite related products. We are able to supply end-users in graphite application zones including industries of steel, metallurgy, non-ferrous, PV, energy storage, optical fiber, semiconductor, chemicals. In addition, through our sales channels, we also supply special graphite blocks & rods, graphite electrodes, precision machined graphite parts & components, carbon fiber felt, bipolar graphite plates, graphite oxide & graphene.

Organizational Structure Chart
 
The following chart sets forth our organizational structure:  
 

Our Products
 
Through our subsidiary we now perform minor manufacture and sell the following products: 
 

● | graphene; 
--+------------------------------
● | graphene oxide; 
● | carbon graphite felt; and 


● | graphite bipolar plates. 
--+-----------------------------

 
Graphene Oxide has wide applications as a conductive agent, such as in lithium ion batteries, super capacitors, rubber and plastic additives, conductive ink, special coating, transparent conductive thin films and chips.  
 
Graphite bipolar plates are primarily used in solar power storage.
 
In 2018, the Company discovered an Innovational Anti-Bacterial Graphene Silver Composite. The Company has applied for a patent on this new graphene/silver invention. This powerful composite has a bacterial killing rate of 99% in just 4 hours. The bacteria is used to test for product potency that includes: staphylococcus aureus, colibacillus and blastomyces albicans.
 
The Company’s new material is forecasted to replace the current leading cure for dermatomycosis, a nano-silver based medicine. In addition, the new composite can be material for resin/polymer fiber industrial products such as: anti-bacterial PU insole, anti-bacterial PET fiber, etc. Due to its wide array of industrial and medical applications, this material will provide great chances for Royal Shanghai further expand towards new markets.

Competition and Competitive Advantages
 
We compete with a large number of domestic and international companies that manufacture graphene and grapheme related products. Because of the nature of the products that we sell, we believe that the reputation of the manufacturer and the quality of the product may be as important as price.
Government Regulations
 
Statutory Reserve
 
On December 31, 2013, the Company acquired new operations carried through BVI Co., and its subsidiaries Royal HK and Royal Shanghai. All of the cash generated by our operations has been held by our China entities. In order to transfer such cash to our parent entity, China Carbon Graphite Group, Inc., which is a Nevada Corporation, we would need to rely on dividends, loans or advances made by our PRC subsidiaries or VIE entity. Such transfers may be subject to certain regulations or risks. To date, our parent entity has paid its expenses by raising capital through private placement transactions. In the future, in the event that our parent entity is unable to raise needed funds from private investors, Royal Shanghai would have to transfer funds to our parent entity through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Royal HK and BVI Co.
 
PRC regulations relating to statutory reserves and currency conversion would impact our ability to transfer cash within our corporate structure. The Company Law of the PRC applicable to Chinese companies provides that net after tax income should be allocated by the following rules:
 

1. | 10% of after tax income to be allocated to a statutory surplus reserve until the reserve amounts to 50% of the company’s registered capital. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | If the accumulate balance of statutory surplus reserve is not enough to make up the Company’s cumulative prior years’ losses, the current year’s after tax income should be first used to make up the losses before the statutory surplus reverse is drawn. 
3. | Allocation can be made to the discretionary surplus reserve, if such a reserve is approved at the meeting of the equity owners. 

 
Therefore, the Company is required to maintain a statutory reserve in China that limits any equity distributions to its shareholders. The maximum amount of the shareholders has not been reached. The company has never distributed earnings to shareholders and has consistently stated in the Company’s filings it has no intentions to do so. 
 
The RMB cannot be freely exchanged into Dollars. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) administers foreign exchange dealings and requires that they be conducted though designated financial institutions. Foreign Investment Enterprises, such as Royal Shanghai, may purchase foreign currency from designated financial institutions in connection with current account transactions, including profit repatriation.
 
These factors will limit the amount of funds that we can transfer from Royal Shanghai to our parent entity and may delay any such transfer. In addition, upon repatriation of earnings of Royal Shanghai to the United States, those earnings may become subject to United States federal and state income taxes. We have not accrued any U.S. federal or state tax liability on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary because those funds are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our international operations. Accordingly, taxes imposed upon repatriation of those earnings to the U.S. would reduce the net worth of the Company.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental protection laws and regulations.

Circular 106 Compliance and Approval
 
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) issued an official notice known as “Circular 106,” which requires the owners of any Chinese company to obtain SAFE’s approval before establishing any offshore holding company structure to facilitate foreign financing or subsequent acquisitions in China.  We believe that our wholly-owned subsidiaries Talent and BVI. Co. were not required to obtain SAFE’s approval to establish its offshore companies Yongle and Royal HK as “special purpose vehicle” for capital raising activities on behalf of Royal Shanghai because of offshore structure.
Restrictions on Exports of Natural Resources
 
In 2010, the Chinese government decided to implement a number of new restrictions on natural resource industry sectors. As a result, domestic Chinese companies in certain natural resource industries face export restrictions.  Such restrictions may limit our ability to export our products in the future, or may increase the expense of our exports, which may impact our business.
Employees
 
As of March 2018, we had 8 full-time employees. As of March 2017, we had 7 full-time employees.
