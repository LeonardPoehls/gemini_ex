ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Proofpoint is a leading next generation cybersecurity company that enables large and mid-sized organizations worldwide to protect the way their people work from advanced threats and compliance risks. Our security and compliance platform is comprised of an integrated suite of threat protection, information protection, and brand protection solutions, including email protection, advanced threat protection, email authentication, data loss prevention, SaaS application protection, response orchestration and automation, digital risk, web browser isolation, email encryption, archiving, eDiscovery, supervision, and secure communication. Our solutions are built on a flexible, cloud-based platform and leverage a number of proprietary technologies - including big data analytics, machine learning, deep content inspection, secure storage, advanced encryption, intelligent message routing, dynamic malware analysis, threat correlation, and virtual execution environments to address today’s rapidly changing threat and compliance landscape.
Cyberattacks have fundamentally shifted from targeting infrastructure to targeting people, relying on tricking users into running code, divulging their passwords, or even sending money or data. This transformation of the threat landscape manifests in nearly every form of cyber threat, from nation state advanced persistent threat (APT) actors relying on phishing, through to cybercriminals launching massive ransomware email campaigns, and more targeted campaigns designed to steal valuable data from both legacy and cloud-based systems. At the same time, the rapid adoption of cloud applications has increased organizations’ attack surface by moving both threats and sensitive data away from the traditional network perimeter, reducing the effectiveness of many existing security products. These factors have contributed to an increasing number of severe data breaches and expanding regulatory mandates, notably the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), all of which have accelerated demand for effective threat protection and compliance solutions.
Our platform addresses this growing challenge by not only protecting data as it flows into and out of the enterprise via on-premises and cloud-based email, social media, and other cloud applications, but also by keeping track of this information as it is modified and distributed throughout the enterprise for compliance and data loss prevention, and securely archiving these communications for compliance and discovery. We address four important problems for the enterprise:

• | Protecting users from the advanced attacks that target them via email, social media, and SaaS apps;


• | Preventing the theft or inadvertent loss of sensitive information and, in turn, ensuring compliance with regulatory data protection mandates;


• | Collecting, retaining, supervising and discovering sensitive data for compliance and litigation support; and


• | Enabling organizations to respond quickly to security issues, providing both the intelligence and the context to prioritize incidents and orchestrate remediation actions.

Our platform and its associated solutions are sold to customers on a subscription basis and can be deployed through our unique cloud-based architecture that leverages both our global data centers as well as optional points-of-presence behind our customers’ firewalls. Our flexible deployment model enables us to deliver superior security and compliance while maintaining the favorable economics afforded by cloud computing, creating a competitive advantage for us over legacy on-premises and cloud-only offerings.
We were founded in 2002 to provide a unified solution to help enterprises address their growing data security requirements. Our first solution was commercially released in 2003 to combat the burgeoning problem of spam and viruses and their impact on corporate email systems. To address the evolving threat landscape and the adoption of communication and collaboration systems beyond corporate email and networks, we have broadened our solutions to defend against a wide range of threats, including email, mobile apps and social media, to protect the information people create from both compromise and compliance risks, and to archive and govern corporate information. Today, our solutions are used worldwide to protect well over 100 million end-users at enterprise customers, and millions more via service providers through our Cloudmark division. We market and sell our solutions worldwide both directly through our sales teams and indirectly through a hybrid model where our sales organization actively assists our network of distributors and resellers. We also distribute our solutions through strategic partners.

Proofpoint Solutions
Our integrated suite of on-demand security-as-a-service solutions enables large and mid-sized organizations to protect people throughout the enterprise from advanced attacks and compliance risks. Our comprehensive platform provides a secure email gateway, advanced threat protection, threat intelligence, email authentication, email encryption, data loss prevention, digital risk, SaaS application protection, web browser isolation, archiving, eDiscovery, and threat response capabilities. These solutions are built on a cloud-based architecture, protecting enterprises and their customers from inbound threats via email, social media, and mobile apps, while identifying and protecting enterprise data not only where it is stored within the enterprise but also as it transits beyond the organization’s borders such as via email or social media. We have pioneered the use of innovative technologies to deliver better ease-of-use, greater protection against the latest advanced threats, and lower total cost of ownership than traditional alternatives. The key elements of our solution include:

• | Superior protection against both advanced and targeted threats. We use a combination of proprietary technologies for big data analytics, machine learning, deep content inspection, static and dynamic malware analysis, protocol analysis, threat correlation, threat intelligence extraction, and virtual execution environments to predictively and actively detect and stop targeted “spear phishing” and other sophisticated advanced threats, including malicious attachments, polymorphic threats, zero-day exploits, user-transparent “drive-by” downloads, malicious web links, hybrid threats (such as links inserted into attached files), malware free attacks like impostor threats and credential phishing, and other penetration tactics. By processing, analyzing and correlating billions of data points on a daily basis, we can recognize anomalies in order to predictively detect targeted attacks before users are exposed. Our deep content inspection technology enables us to identify malicious message attachments and distinguish between valid messages and “phishing” messages designed to look authentic and trick the end-user into divulging sensitive data or clicking on a malicious web link. Our machine learning technology enables us to detect targeted “zero-hour” attacks in real-time, even if they have not been seen previously at other locations, and quarantine them appropriately. Our dynamic malware analysis and virtual execution environment technologies enable us to examine web site destinations and downloadable files to identify and block potentially hostile code that would otherwise compromise end-user computers, even in cases where the web sites are considered reputable or the attachment’s malicious payload is obfuscated or otherwise disguised. Our threat correlation technologies enable us to rapidly confirm and contain threats, providing rapid, automated protection. In addition, our threat intelligence and response capabilities enable our customers to both prioritize threats that may have compromised them via our Emerging Threat Intelligence and orchestrate or automate protective countermeasures via Proofpoint Threat Response. 


• | Comprehensive, integrated email security, advanced threat, information protection and archiving, and digital risk protection product families. We offer a comprehensive solution for email security, composed of our Enterprise Protection, Email Fraud Defense, and Email Continuity offerings. Our advanced threat product family includes solutions to protect organizations across the predominant threat vectors, including email, social media, mobile apps, and SaaS applications. To protect enterprise data from security and compliance risks, our Information Protection product family includes a suite of security solutions (Data Loss Prevention, Encryption, and Data Discover for data at rest) and compliance (Enterprise Archive, eDiscovery Analytics, and Supervision). Finally, our digital risk protection suite enables organizations to look beyond their borders for threats targeting their customers across email phishing, malicious web domains, fraudulent mobile apps, and fraudulent social media accounts.


• | Designed to empower end-users. Unlike legacy offerings that simply block communication or report audit violations, our solutions actively enable secure business-to-business and business-to-consumer communications. Our easy-to-use policy-based email encryption service automatically encrypts sensitive emails and delivers them to any PC or mobile device. In addition, our secure file-transfer solution makes it easy for end-users to securely share various forms of documents and other content that are typically too large to send through traditional e-mail systems. All of our solutions provide mobile-optimized capabilities to empower the growing number of people who use mobile devices as their primary computing platform.

Proofpoint Information Protection and Archiving
A comprehensive data protection strategy must address both security and compliance risks. Our data loss prevention, encryption and compliance solution defends against leaks of confidential information, and helps ensure compliance with common U.S., international and industry-specific data protection regulations - including the Health Care Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, as well as acts such as CA SB 24, MA 201 CMR 17.00, ITAR, NERC-CIP, CFTC red flag rules, Basel II, EuroSOX (Directive 84/253/EEC), the European Union GDPR, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).
Proofpoint Information Protection and Archiving is designed to ensure accurate enforcement of data governance, data retention and supervision policies and mandates; cost-effective litigation support through efficient discovery; and active legal-hold management. It can store, govern and discover a wide range of data including email, instant message conversations, social media interactions, and other files throughout the enterprise.
Key capabilities within Proofpoint Information Protection and Archiving include:

• | Advanced data loss prevention. Our advanced data loss prevention solution identifies regulated private content, valuable corporate assets and confidential information before it leaves the organization via email, web-based applications, or our Secure Share solution. Pre-packaged smart identifiers and dictionaries automatically and accurately detect a wide range of regulated content such as social security numbers, health records, credit card numbers, and driver’s license numbers. In addition to regulated content, our machine learning technology can identify confidential, organization-specific content and assets. Once identified and classified, sensitive data can be blocked, encrypted and transmitted or re-routed internally based on content and identity-aware policies. 


• | Flexible remediation and supervision. Content, identity and destination-aware policies enable effective remediation of potential data breaches or regulatory violations. Remediation options include stopping the transfer completely, automatically forcing data-encryption, or routing to a compliance supervisor or the end-user for disposition. The solution also provides comprehensive reporting on potential violations and remediation using our analytics capabilities. 


• | Policy-based encryption. Automatically encrypts regulated and other sensitive data before it leaves an organization’s security perimeter without requiring cumbersome end-user key management. This enables authorized external recipients, whether or not they are our customers, to quickly and easily decrypt and view content from most devices. 


• | Encrypted message portal. Organizations in regulated industries like financial services and healthcare frequently need to share highly confidential messages with outside parties. Proofpoint provides a “pull encryption” portal that enables these organizations to create branded portals that seamlessly integrate with their email systems to securely communicate with their customers, patients, or other third parties. 


• | Secure share. Cloud-based security-focused solution designed to enable enterprise users to securely exchange large files with ease while staying compliant with enterprise data policies. 


• | Data Discover. Automated discovery and remediation solution that identifies sensitive content across the enterprise and enables corrective action, while reducing risk of data breaches and compliance violations. 


• | Secure cloud storage. With our proprietary double blind encryption technology and the associated data storage architecture, all email messages, files and other content are encrypted with keys controlled by the customer before the data enters the Proofpoint Enterprise Archive. This ensures that even our employees and law-enforcement agencies cannot access a readable form of the customer data without authorized access by the customer to the encryption keys stored behind the customer’s firewall.

• | Search performance. By employing parallel, big data search techniques, we are able to deliver search performance measured in seconds, even when searching hundreds of terabytes of archived data. Traditional on-premise solutions can take hours or even days to return search results to a complex query. 


• | Flexible policy enforcement. Enables organizations to easily define and automatically enforce data retention and destruction policies necessary to comply with regulatory mandates or internal policies that can vary by user, group, geography or domain. 


• | Active legal-hold management. Enables administrators or legal professionals to easily designate specific individuals or content as subject to legal-hold. Proofpoint Enterprise Archive then provides active management of these holds by suspending normal deletion policies and automatically archiving subsequent messages and files related to the designated matter. 


• | End-user supervision. Leveraging our flexible workflow capabilities, Proofpoint Enterprise Archive analyzes all electronic communications, including email and communications from leading instant messaging and social networking sites, for potential violations of regulations, such as those imposed by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and the SEC in the financial services industry. 

Key benefits of Proofpoint Information Protection and Archiving include:

• | Regulatory compliance. Data Loss Prevention and Encryption enable outbound messages to comply with national and state government and industry-specific privacy regulations, while Enterprise Archive helps organizations meet regulatory requirements by archiving all messages and content according to compliance retention policies and enabling staff to systematically review messages for compliance supervision. SaaS Protection extends the same compliance functionality to cloud applications like Office 365, Box, Salesforce, and G Suite. 


• | Superior malicious and accidental data loss protection. Protects against the loss of sensitive data, whether from a cybercriminal attempting to exfiltrate valuable data from a compromised system, or from an employee accidentally distributing a file to the wrong party through email, webmail, social media, file sharing, or other Internet-based mechanisms for publishing content. 


• | Easy-to-use secure communication. Allows corporate end-users to easily share sensitive data without compromising security and privacy, and enables authorized external recipients to transparently decrypt and read the communications from any device. Our mobile-optimized interfaces provide an easy experience for the rapidly growing number of recipients on smartphones and tablets. 


• | Reduction in “attack surface”. Enables the automated protection of sensitive data, reducing the amount of critical information potentially exposed to an attacker in a breach scenario.


• | Proactive data governance. Allows organizations to create, maintain and consistently enforce a clear corporate data retention policy, reducing the risk of data loss and the cost of eDiscovery. 


• | Efficient litigation support. Provides advanced search features that reduce the cost of eDiscovery and allow organizations to more effectively manage the litigation hold process. 


• | Reduced storage and management costs. Helps to simplify mailbox and file system management by automatically moving storage-intensive attachments and files into cost-effective cloud storage. 

Proofpoint Digital Risk Protection
Proofpoint Digital Risk Protection looks beyond the enterprise perimeter to deliver real-time, omnichannel digital risk discovery and protection from brand fraud, data loss, physical threats, and cyber threats. With this solution, enterprises can engage with their customers across web, email, mobile, and social media with the confidence that their brands and customers are safe from all forms of digital risk.
The key features of the Digital Risk product family include:

Competition
Our markets are highly competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid changes in technology. We compete primarily with companies that offer a broad array of data protection and governance solutions. Providers of data protection solutions generally have product offerings that include threat protection, virus protection, data loss prevention, flexible remediation, data encryption, and in some cases secure file transfer. Providers of archiving solutions generally have product offerings that provide data storage, search, policy enforcement, legal-hold management, and in some cases supervision.
Key competitors include:

• | Email and Advanced Threat Protection: Cisco Systems, Inc. (through its acquisitions of IronPort, SourceFire, and ThreatGRID), Microsoft Corporation (through its acquisition of Frontbridge), FireEye, Inc., Symantec Corporation (through its acquisitions of Brightmail and MessageLabs), Mimecast and Google (through its acquisition of Postini).

• | Archiving: Micro Focus International plc and Veritas Technologies LLC (through its acquisitions of KVS and LiveOffice while under the ownership of Symantec Corporation). 

We believe we compete favorably based on the following factors:

• | effectiveness of our protection against advanced threats;


• | comprehensiveness and integration of the solution;


• | flexibility of delivery models;


• | total cost of ownership;


• | scalability and performance;


• | customer support; and


• | extensibility of platform.

Certain of our competitors have greater sales, marketing and financial resources, more extensive geographic presence and greater name recognition than we do. We may face future competition in our markets from other large, established companies, as well as from emerging companies. In addition, we expect that there is likely to be continued consolidation in our industry that could lead to increased price competition and other forms of competition.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2017, we had 93 patents and 47 patent applications. We have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our solutions are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products with the same functionality as our solution. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult.
We expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 2,047 employees. We also engage a number of temporary employees and consultants. None of our employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Competition for qualified personnel remains intense and we may not be successful in retaining our key employees or attracting skilled personnel.
