ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
We are an independent servicer and originator of mortgage loans and servicer of reverse mortgage loans. We service a wide array of loans across the credit spectrum for our own portfolio and for GSEs, government agencies, third-party securitization trusts and other credit owners. Through our consumer, correspondent and wholesale lending channels, we originate and purchase residential mortgage loans that we predominantly sell to GSEs and government agencies. We also operate two supplementary businesses; asset receivables management and real estate owned property management and disposition. Our goal is to become a partner with our customers; assisting them with the originations process and through the life of their loan, with a highly regarded originations and servicing platform and quality customer service in an open, honest and straightforward manner.
We are a Maryland corporation incorporated in 1997 and operate throughout the U.S. Our business was established in 1958 and operated as the captive financing business of Walter Energy, originating and purchasing residential loans and servicing these loans to maturity. In April 2009, we were spun off from Walter Energy; merged with Hanover; qualified as a REIT; and began to operate our business as an independent, publicly-traded company. After the spin-off, in 2010 we acquired Marix, a high-touch specialty mortgage servicer, and in 2011 we acquired Green Tree, a leading independent mortgage loan servicer providing high-touch servicing of GSE, government agency and third-party mortgage loans. As a result of the Green Tree acquisition, we no longer qualified as a REIT. Since then, we have grown our servicing and originations businesses both organically and through a number of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of RMS and S1L in 2012, the acquisition of a national originations platform in 2013 from ResCap and significant bulk servicing right acquisitions in 2013 and 2014. 
The terms “Walter Investment,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” as used throughout this report refer to Walter Investment Management Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
At December 31, 2016, we serviced 2.1 million residential loans with an unpaid principal balance of $246.4 billion. We originated $20.3 billion in mortgage loan volume in 2016. We manage our Company in three reportable segments: Servicing; Originations; and Reverse Mortgage. A description of the business conducted by each of these segments is provided below:
Servicing - Our Servicing segment performs servicing for our own mortgage loan portfolio and on behalf of third-party credit owners of mortgage loans for a fee and also performs subservicing for third-party owners of MSR. The Servicing segment also operates complementary businesses including a collections agency that performs collections of post charge-off deficiency balances for third parties and us. In addition, the Servicing segment holds the assets and mortgage-backed debt of the Residual Trusts.
Our servicing and subservicing activities relating to our mortgage loan portfolio involve the management (e.g., calculation, collection and remittance) of mortgage payments, escrow accounts, and insurance claims. For certain accounts, we perform specialty servicing activities utilizing a “high-touch” model to establish and maintain borrower contact and facilitate loss-mitigation strategies in an attempt to keep defaulted borrowers in their homes. Borrower interactions rely on loss mitigation strategies that apply predictive analytics to identify risk factors and severity grades to determine appropriate loss mitigation options and strategies. We assign a single point of contact to accounts experiencing difficulties in order to make collection calls and coordinate loss mitigation efforts. The single point of contact allows us to build one-on-one relationships with our consumers. We generally follow GSE and agency servicing guidelines (as well as other credit-owner guidelines) to implement a standardized loss mitigation process, which may include loan modification programs for borrowers experiencing temporary hardships. Our loan modification offerings include short-term interest rate reductions and/or payment deferrals and, until recently, also included loan modifications through HAMP, a federally sponsored loan modification program established to assist eligible home owners with loan modifications on their home mortgage debt. When loan modification and other efforts are unable to cure a default, we pursue alternative property resolutions prior to pursuing foreclosure, including short sales (in which the borrower agrees to sell the property for less than the loan balance and the difference is forgiven) and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure (in which the borrower agrees to convey the property deed outside of foreclosure proceedings).
With respect to mortgage loans for which we own the MSR, we perform mortgage servicing primarily in accordance with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae servicing guidelines, as applicable. In 2016, we earned approximately 46%, 9% and 9% of our total revenues from servicing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae residential loans, respectively. Under our numerous master servicing agreements and subservicing contracts, we agree to service loans in accordance with servicing standards that the credit owners and/or subservicing clients may change from time to time. These agreements and contracts can typically be terminated by the counterparties thereto, with or without cause. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of certain risks relating to our master servicing agreements and subservicing contracts.

We have acquired servicing rights in bulk transactions, pursuant to co-issue arrangements and in connection with business acquisitions, and by retaining servicing rights relating to mortgage loans we originate. As the owner of servicing rights, we act on behalf of loan owners and have the contractual right to receive a stream of cash flows (expressed as a percentage of unpaid principal balance) in exchange for performing specified servicing functions and temporarily advancing funds to meet contractual payment requirements for loan owners and to pay taxes, insurance and foreclosure costs on delinquent or defaulted mortgages. As a subservicer, we earn a contractual fee on a per-loan basis and we are reimbursed for servicing advances we make on delinquent or defaulted mortgages, generally in the following month. We can earn incentive fees based on the performance of certain loan pools serviced by us and also have the ability, under certain circumstances, to earn modification fees and other program-specific incentives, and ancillary fees, such as late fees. Our specialty servicing fees typically include a base servicing fee and activity-based fees for the successful completion of default-related services.
The value of a servicing right asset is based on the present value of the stream of expected servicing-related cash flows from a loan and is largely dependent on market interest rates, prepayment speeds and delinquency performance. Generally, a rising interest rate environment drives a decline in prepayment speeds and thus increases the value of servicing rights, while a declining interest rate environment drives increases in prepayment speeds and thus reduces the value of servicing rights.
Our Servicing segment procured voluntary insurance for residential loan borrowers, lender-placed hazard insurance for residential loan borrowers and credit owners and other ancillary products through our principal insurance agency until the sale of such agency and substantially all of our insurance agency business on February 1, 2017. This agency earned commissions on insurance sales, and commissions were earned on lender-placed insurance in certain circumstances and if permitted under applicable laws and regulations. Mortgage loans require borrowers to maintain insurance coverage to protect the collateral securing the loan. To the extent a borrower fails to maintain the necessary coverage, we are generally contractually required to add the borrower’s property to our own hazard insurance policy and charge the borrower his/her allocated premium amount. Though we were licensed nationwide to sell insurance products on behalf of third-party insurance carriers, we neither underwrote insurance policies nor adjudicated claims. 
Insurance revenues were historically aligned with the size of our servicing portfolio. However, due to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac restrictions that became effective on June 1, 2014, as well as other regulatory and litigation developments with respect to lender-placed insurance, our insurance commissions related to lender-placed insurance policies began to decrease materially beginning in 2014. On February 1, 2017, we completed the sale of our principal insurance agency and substantially all of our insurance agency business. As a result of this sale, we will no longer receive any insurance commissions on lender-placed insurance policies. Commencing February 1, 2017, another insurance agency owned by us (and retained by us following the aforementioned sale) began to provide insurance marketing services to third-party insurance agencies and carriers with respect to voluntary insurance policies, including hazard insurance. This insurance agency receives premium-based commissions for its insurance marketing services. 
Our Servicing segment performs collections of post charge-off or foreclosure deficiency balances for itself and on behalf of third-party securitization trusts and other asset owners. The third-party fee we earn is based on a percentage of our collections or a percentage of the unpaid principal balance. We recognize revenues associated with our on-balance sheet charged-off loan portfolio through its change in fair value. 
Subservicing
As of December 31, 2016, we were the subservicer for 0.9 million accounts with an unpaid principal loan balance of $120.8 billion. These subserviced accounts represented approximately 49% of our total servicing portfolio based on unpaid principal loan balance at that date. Our largest subservicing customer, NRM, represented approximately 56% of our total subservicing portfolio based on unpaid principal loan balance on December 31, 2016. Our next largest subservicing customer represented approximately 23% of our total subservicing portfolio based on unpaid principal loan balance on December 31, 2016.
The subservicing contracts pursuant to which we are retained to subservice mortgage loans generally provide that our customer, the owner of the MSR that we subservice, can terminate us as subservicer with or without cause, and each such contract has unique terms establishing the fees we will be paid for our work under the contract or upon the termination of the contract, if any, and the standards of performance we are required to meet in servicing the relevant mortgage loans, such that the profitability of our subservicing activity may vary among different contracts. We believe that our subservicing customers consider various factors from time to time in determining whether to retain or change subservicers, including the financial strength and servicer ratings of the subservicer, the subservicer's record of compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations (including any enhanced, "high touch" processes required by the contract) and the success of the subservicer in limiting the delinquency rate of the relevant portfolio. The termination of one or more of our subservicing contracts could have a material adverse effect on us, including on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of certain additional risks and uncertainties relating to our subservicing contracts.

Originations - Our Originations segment originates and purchases mortgage loans through the following channels: 

• | consumer originations, which is comprised of:


◦ | consumer retention - originates mortgage loans primarily through the use of a centralized call center that utilizes leads generated through solicitations of consumers in our existing servicing portfolio and through referrals from our servicing call centers; and


◦ | consumer direct - originates mortgage loans primarily through the use of a centralized call center that utilizes origination leads generated through direct mail, internet, telephone and general advertising campaign solicitations of consumers, some of whom who are not currently in our existing servicing portfolio;


• | correspondent lending - purchases closed mortgage loans from a network of lenders in the marketplace; and


• | wholesale lending - originates mortgage loans through a network of approved brokers. During the third quarter of 2016 we re-entered the wholesale channel in an effort to expand our customer base.

Beginning in 2016, we combined our consumer retention and consumer direct call centers to pursue a more streamlined consumer lending process. In January 2016, we exited activities associated with our consumer retail channel, which originated mortgage loans through loan officers. Our consumer retail channel originated $551.3 million in mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2015. 
Our consumer originations operations offer a range of home purchase and refinance mortgage loan options, including fixed and adjustable rate conventional conforming, Ginnie Mae, FHA, VA, USDA and jumbo products. A conventional conforming loan is a mortgage loan that conforms to GSE guidelines, which include, but are not limited to, limits on loan amount, loan-to-value ratios, debt-to-income ratios, and minimum credit scores. Our product offerings include special financing programs such as HARP, which has expanded loan-to-value limits for qualified applicants as compared to conventional conforming loans. The mortgage loans we fund are generally eligible for sale to GSEs or insured by government agencies. 
We underwrite the mortgage loans we originate generally to secondary market standards, including the standards set by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the FHA, the USDA, the VA, and jumbo loan investor programs. Loans are reviewed by our underwriters in an attempt to ensure each mortgage loan is documented according to, and its terms comply with, the applicable secondary market standard. Our underwriters determine loan eligibility based on specific loan product requirements, such as loan-to-value, FICO, or maximum loan amount. Third-party diligence tools are utilized by our underwriters to validate data supplied by the potential borrower and to uncover potential discrepancies. We conduct audits on our underwriters to confirm proper adherence to our internal guidelines and polices, which audits are in addition to our standard quality control review. These audits are designed to provide an additional layer of internal review in an attempt to further mitigate quality defects and repurchase risk in the originations process. 
Within our correspondent lending channel, we generally purchase the same types of loans that we originate in our consumer originations channel, although the mix varies among these channels. Correspondent lenders with which we do business agree to comply with our client guide, which sets forth the terms and conditions for selling loans to us and generally governs the business relationship. We monitor and attempt to mitigate counterparty risk related to loans that we acquire through our correspondent lending channel by conducting quality control reviews of correspondent lenders, reviewing compliance by correspondent lenders with applicable underwriting standards and our client guide, and evaluating the credit worthiness of correspondent lenders on a periodic basis. In 2016, our correspondent lending channel purchased loans from 502 lenders in the marketplace, of which 45 were associated with approximately half of our purchases. 
Within our wholesale lending channel, we originate loans through mortgage brokers. Loans sourced by mortgage brokers are underwritten and funded by us and generally close in our name. Through the wholesale channel, we generally originate the same types of loans that we originate in our consumer originations channel, although the mix varies among these channels. We underwrite and process all loan applications submitted by the mortgage brokers in a manner consistent with that described above for the consumer originations channel. Mortgage brokers with whom we do business agree to comply with our client guide, which sets forth the terms and conditions for brokering loans to us and generally governs the business relationship. We monitor and attempt to mitigate counterparty risk related to loans that we originate through our wholesale lending channel by conducting quality control reviews of mortgage brokers, reviewing compliance by brokers with applicable underwriting standards and our client guide, and evaluating the credit worthiness of brokers on a periodic basis.
Our capital markets group is responsible for pricing loans and managing the interest rate risk through the time a loan is sold to third parties and managing the risk (which we call the “pull-through risk”) that loans we have locked will not be closed and funded in an attempt to maximize loan sale profitability through our various originations channels. The capital markets group uses models and hedging analysis in an attempt to maximize profitability while minimizing the risks inherent in the originations business.

During 2015, the mix of mortgage loans sold by our Originations segment (which includes loans originated and purchased through all channels) shifted away from what had historically been substantially all Fannie Mae conventional conforming loans. In 2015, the mix of mortgage loans originated by our Originations segment, based on unpaid principal balance, consisted of (i) 56% Fannie Mae conventional conforming loans, (ii) 35% Ginnie Mae loans and (iii) 9% Freddie Mac conventional conforming loans. In 2016, the mix of mortgage loans originated by our Originations segment, based on unpaid principal balance, consisted of (i) 47% Fannie Mae conventional conforming loans, (ii) 39% Ginnie Mae loans and (iii) 14% Freddie Mac conventional conforming loans.
Our Originations segment revenue, which is primarily net gains on sales of loans, is impacted by interest rates and the volume of loans locked. The margins earned by our Originations segment are impacted by our cost to originate the loans including underwriting, fulfillment and lead costs. We have historically sold our originated and purchased mortgage loans to third parties while retaining the servicing rights. Our future strategy is to shift from retaining the servicing rights for mortgage loans sold to third parties in favor of subservicing. 
Reverse Mortgage - Our Reverse Mortgage segment primarily focuses on the servicing of reverse loans. In December 2016, management decided to exit the reverse mortgage originations business, which occurred in January 2017. We intend to fulfill reverse loans in our originations pipeline consistent with our underwriting practices and to fund undrawn amounts available to borrowers, and we will continue to service reverse loans. Reverse loan originations were historically conducted through our consumer direct, consumer retail, wholesale and correspondent lending origination channels. 
The consumer retail channel originated reverse loans in 47 states and the District of Columbia through loan officers located in approximately 20 licensed locations throughout the U.S. The consumer direct channel originated reverse loans through call centers with leads purchased from lead purveyors or generated via advertising campaigns. The wholesale channel sourced reverse loans from a network of brokers. The correspondent channel purchased reverse loans from a network of correspondents in the marketplace. 
This segment receives cash proceeds at the time reverse loans are securitized. We securitize substantially all our reverse loans through the Ginnie Mae II MBS program into HMBS. Based upon the structure of the Ginnie Mae II MBS program, we determined that these securitizations do not meet all of the requirements for sale accounting, and as such, we account for these transfers as secured borrowings. Under this accounting treatment, the reverse loans remain on our consolidated balance sheets as residential loans. The segment earns net revenue on the net fair value gains on reverse loans and the related HMBS obligations. 
This segment also performs subservicing for third-party credit owners of reverse loans, similar to our Servicing segment, and provides other complementary services for the reverse mortgage market, such as real estate owned property management and disposition, for a fee.
Other - As of December 31, 2016, our Other non-reportable segment holds the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts and corporate debt. This segment also includes our asset management business, which we are in the process of winding down.
As previously reported, during the first quarter of 2015, we took steps to simplify our business and reorganized our reportable segments to align with our changes in the management reporting structure. As a result of this reorganization, we combined the ARM, Insurance, and Loans and Residuals businesses into the Servicing segment. Refer to Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information relating to our segments. 
Competition 
We compete with a great number of institutions in the mortgage banking market for both the servicing and originations businesses as well as in our reverse mortgage and complementary businesses. In the servicing area, we compete with other servicers to acquire MSR and for the right to subservice mortgages for others. Competitive factors in the servicing business include: a servicer’s scale of operations and financial strength; a servicer’s access to capital to fund acquisitions of MSR; a servicer’s ability to meet contractual and regulatory obligations and to achieve favorable performance (e.g., in default management activity) relative to other servicers; a servicer’s ability to provide a favorable experience for the borrower; and a servicer’s cost to service or subservice. In the mortgage originations area, we compete to refinance or provide new mortgages to borrowers whose mortgages are in our existing servicing portfolio. In this area, the price and variety of our mortgage products are important factors of competition, as is the reputation of our servicing business and the quality of the experience the borrower may have had with our servicing business. Since mid-2015, our loan origination and servicing businesses have operated under a single “Ditech” brand. We also compete, principally on the basis of price and process efficiency, to acquire mortgages from correspondent lenders. In the future, as we attempt to grow the amount of purchase money (i.e., non-refinance) mortgages we originate, we expect we will also increasingly compete on the basis of brand awareness.
Across our servicing and originations businesses, technology is an important competitive factor. In particular, we believe it will be increasingly important to enable servicing and originations customers to access our services through our website and mobile devices. We face numerous competitors with greater financial resources, human resources and technology resources than ours, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully.

Technology 
Our businesses employ technology by using third-party systems where standardization is key and proprietary systems where functionality, flexibility and time to market are critical to regulatory compliance, customer experience and credit performance. The majority of our proprietary systems are supported by a team of information technology professionals who seek to protect our systems and ensure they are effective. In-house developed proprietary systems are leveraged for customer service, default management, data modeling and reverse mortgage servicing. 
On October 27, 2014, we signed a long-term Loan Servicing Agreement with Black Knight Financial Services, LLC for the use of MSP, a mortgage and consumer loan servicing platform. We also use our own proprietary systems for collections, customer service and default management. During the second quarter of 2016, we transitioned approximately 1.4 million loans, or greater than 60% of our mortgage loan servicing portfolio, to MSP, and now have greater than 75% of our mortgage loan servicing portfolio on MSP. Our private label loans, manufactured housing loans and second lien mortgage loans continue to be serviced on our proprietary systems.
Subsidiaries
For a listing of our subsidiaries, refer to Exhibit 21 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.
Employees
We employed approximately 4,900 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2016 as compared to approximately 5,900 at December 31, 2015, all of whom were located in the U.S. The decline in full-time equivalent employees was due primarily to distinct actions we took in 2016 in connection with our continued efforts to enhance efficiencies and streamline processes within the organization, which included various organizational changes to scale our leadership team and support functions to further align with our business needs. We believe we have been successful in our efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees. However, we experience significant turnover with respect to certain roles at the Company, and therefore maintain active and continuous new employee recruiting and training programs. None of our employees is a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
We outsource certain back-office functions that support our loan originations and servicing groups to third-party vendors located in the U.S. and offshore locations in an effort to improve efficiency and reduce cost. These back-office functions include loan set-up, escrow account set-up, claims filing, post-close audits, indexing and imaging. When we outsource a function, we retain a third-party vendor to perform such function as opposed to having our employees perform such function. From time to time we expect to outsource additional back-office and other functions. We have recently increased the number of functions we outsource, as well as our use of offshore vendors generally, especially with respect to certain of our technology functions, and we expect to outsource additional back-office and other functions in the future both domestically and abroad.
Transactions with NRM
On August 8, 2016, Ditech Financial and NRM executed the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement whereby Ditech Financial agreed to sell to NRM all of Ditech Financial’s right, title and interest in mortgage servicing rights with respect to a pool of mortgage loans, with subservicing retained. The NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement provides that, from time to time, Ditech Financial may sell additional MSR to NRM in bulk or as originated or acquired on a flow basis, subject in each case to the parties agreeing on price and certain other terms. 
During 2016, in various bulk sale transactions under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement, we sold NRM mortgage servicing rights relating to mortgage loans having an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $59.8 billion as of the applicable closing dates of such transactions, with subservicing retained. As of December 31, 2016, we had received $250.0 million in cash proceeds relating to such sales, which proceeds do not include certain holdback amounts relating to such sales that we expect to be paid to us over time. In addition, we have recently begun to sell NRM, on a flow basis and with subservicing retained, MSR relating to certain mortgage loans that we originate. NRM also acquired substantially all of WCO’s MSR portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2016, which consisted of MSR relating to mortgage loans having an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $9.8 billion as of the applicable closing dates. Ditech Financial subservices these MSR under the NRM Subservicing Agreement.
The initial term of the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement will expire on the third anniversary of the effective date and shall be renewed for successive one-year terms thereafter unless either party provides written notice to the other party of its election not to renew. Each party to the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement also has termination rights upon the occurrence of certain events and NRM can terminate this agreement at any time on 30 days' notice. In connection with Ditech Financial’s entry into the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement, we entered into a performance and payment guaranty whereby the Parent Company guarantees performance of all obligations and all payments required by Ditech Financial under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement.
12

In addition, on August 8, 2016, Ditech Financial and NRM entered into the NRM Subservicing Agreement whereby Ditech Financial acts as subservicer for the mortgage loans whose MSR are sold by Ditech Financial to NRM under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement and for other mortgage loans as may be agreed upon by Ditech Financial and NRM from time to time, in exchange for a subservicing fee. Under the NRM Subservicing Agreement and a related agreement, Ditech Financial will perform all daily servicing obligations on behalf of NRM with respect to the MSR that are serviced by Ditech Financial pursuant to the terms of the NRM Subservicing Agreement, including collecting payments from borrowers and offering refinancing options to borrowers for purposes of minimizing portfolio runoff. 
With respect to Ditech Financial, the initial term of the NRM Subservicing Agreement will expire on the first anniversary of the effective date thereof and will be automatically renewed for successive one-year terms thereafter. Ditech Financial may terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement without cause at the end of the initial one-year term or at the end of any subsequent one-year renewal term by providing notice to NRM at least 120 days prior to the end of the applicable term. If Ditech Financial elects to terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement without cause, Ditech Financial will not be entitled to receive any deconversion fee, will be responsible for certain servicing transfer costs and will owe NRM a transfer fee if such termination occurs within five years from the effective date of the agreement. Ditech Financial may also terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement immediately for cause upon the occurrence of certain events, including, without limitation, any failure by NRM to remit payments (subject to a cure period), certain bankruptcy or insolvency events of NRM, NRM ceasing to be an approved servicer in good standing with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (unless caused by Ditech Financial) and any failure by NRM to perform, in any material respect, its obligations under the agreement (subject to a cure period). Upon any termination of the NRM Subservicing Agreement by Ditech Financial for cause, NRM will owe Ditech Financial a deconversion fee and be responsible for certain servicing transfer costs.
With respect to NRM, the initial term of the NRM Subservicing Agreement will expire on the first anniversary of the effective date thereof and thereafter the agreement shall automatically terminate unless renewed by NRM on a monthly basis. If NRM fails to renew the agreement, it will owe Ditech Financial a deconversion fee. NRM may terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement without cause at any time during the initial one-year term upon at least 90 days prior notice to Ditech Financial. If NRM elects to terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement without cause, it will owe Ditech Financial a deconversion fee and be responsible for certain servicing transfer costs. NRM may also terminate the NRM Subservicing Agreement immediately for cause upon the occurrence of certain events, including, without limitation, any failure by Ditech Financial to remit payments (subject to a cure period), any failure by Ditech Financial to provide reports to NRM (subject to a cure period), a change of control of Ditech Financial or the Parent Company, the failure of Ditech Financial to satisfy certain portfolio performance measures relating to delinquency rates or advances, Ditech Financial ceasing to be an approved servicer in good standing with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, any failure by Ditech Financial or the Parent Company to satisfy certain financial metrics, certain bankruptcy or insolvency events of Ditech Financial or the Parent Company and any failure by Ditech Financial to perform, in any material respect, its obligations under the agreement (subject to a cure period). Upon any termination of the NRM Subservicing Agreement by NRM for cause, Ditech Financial will not be entitled to receive any deconversion fee, will be responsible for certain servicing transfer costs and will owe NRM a transfer fee if such termination occurs within five years from the effective date of the agreement.
With respect to both the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement and the NRM Subservicing Agreement, Ditech Financial and Walter must satisfy a number of financial metrics, including financial metrics relating to Walter’s consolidated liquidity and consolidated leverage ratio of debt to EBITDA (calculated in accordance with our 2013 Secured Credit Facilities).  Failure to satisfy any of these financial metrics when required would allow termination of these agreements by NRM for cause, and we cannot assure you that, in such event, we would be able to negotiate an amendment, waiver or other arrangement to resolve the matter favorably to us.
Walter Capital Opportunity Corp.
In 2014, we established WCO, a company formed to invest in mortgage-related assets, including MSR and excess servicing spread related to MSR. We own approximately 10% of WCO; third-party investors own the remainder of WCO. Beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2016, WCO, in various transactions, acquired MSR, excess servicing spread and other mortgage-related assets in transactions with us and other market participants. Through our subsidiary investment advisor, we serve as investment manager for WCO and, until the sale of substantially all of its assets, WCO engaged us to subservice its MSR.
In November 2016, WCO entered into a series of agreements whereby it agreed to sell substantially all of its assets, including the sale of substantially all of its MSR portfolio to NRM. In connection with the December 2016 closing of the transactions relating thereto, WCO commenced liquidation activities and we do not expect to sell further assets to WCO.

Rights Agreement
On November 11, 2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated Section 382 Rights Agreement with Computershare, which amends and restates the Rights Agreement between the Company and Computershare dated as of June 29, 2015, as previously amended. Our Board of Directors had previously authorized, and we declared, a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of our common stock. The dividend was payable on July 9, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 9, 2015 and entitled the registered holder thereof to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a fully paid non-assessable share of Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company at a price of $74.16, subject to adjustment as provided in the Rights Agreement. Any shares of common stock issued by us after such date also receive such a right. The terms of the preferred stock purchase rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement. 
Subsequent to the initial adoption of the Rights Agreement, it was amended to, among other things, permit certain stockholders to acquire up to 25% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The Company entered into the November 2016 amendment and restatement of the Rights Agreement to, among other things, lower the ownership thresholds permitted pursuant to the Rights Agreement such that if any person or group of persons, including persons who owned more than the threshold percentage of shares on the amendment date, but excluding certain exempted persons, acquires 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock or any other interest that would be treated as “stock” for the purposes of Section 382, there would be a triggering event potentially resulting in significant dilution in the voting power and economic ownership of such acquiring person or group. The Rights Agreement provides that the rights issued thereunder will expire on November 11, 2017 or upon the earlier occurrence of certain events, subject to the extension of the Rights Agreement by our Board of Directors or the redemption or exchange of the rights by us, in each case as described in, and subject to the terms of, the Rights Agreement. 
The November 2016 amendment to the Rights Agreement was intended to help protect our “built-in tax losses” and certain other tax benefits by acting as a deterrent to any person or group of persons acting in concert from becoming or obtaining the right to become the beneficial owner (including through constructive ownership of securities owned by others) of 4.99% or more of the shares of our common stock, or any other interest that would be treated as “stock” for the purposes of Section 382, then outstanding, without the approval of our Board of Directors, subject to certain exceptions. 
Laws and Regulations
Our business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities, including the CFPB, HUD, VA, the SEC and various state agencies that license, audit and conduct examinations of our mortgage servicing and mortgage originations businesses. We are also subject to a variety of regulatory and contractual obligations imposed by credit owners, investors, insurers and guarantors of the mortgages we originate and service, including, but not limited to, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHFA, USDA and the VA/FHA. Furthermore, our industry has been under scrutiny by federal and state regulators over the past several years, and we expect this scrutiny to continue. Laws, rules, regulations and practices that have been in place for many years may be changed, and new laws, rules, regulations and administrative guidance have been, and may continue to be, introduced in order to address real and perceived problems in our industry. We expect to incur ongoing operational, legal and system costs in order to comply with these rules and regulations.
Federal Law
We are required to comply with numerous federal consumer protection and other laws, including, but not limited to:

• | the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Regulation P, which requires initial and periodic communication with consumers on privacy matters and the maintenance of privacy regarding certain consumer data in our possession;


• | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which regulates the timing and content of communications on debt collections;


• | the TILA, including HOEPA, and Regulation Z, which regulate mortgage loan origination activities, require certain disclosures be made to mortgagors regarding terms of mortgage financing, regulate certain high-cost mortgages, mandate home ownership counseling for mortgage applicants and regulate certain mortgage servicing activities;


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and Regulation V, which collectively regulate the use and reporting of information related to the credit history of consumers;

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, constituted a sweeping reform of the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, as well as the regulation of derivatives, capital market activities and consumer financial services. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a new federal entity responsible for regulating consumer financial services. The CFPB has rulemaking authority with respect to many of the federal consumer protection laws applicable to mortgage servicers and originators, including TILA, RESPA and the FDCPA. The CFPB also has supervision, examination and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services offered by certain non-depository institutions and large insured depository institutions. The CFPB's jurisdiction includes persons (such as us) originating, brokering or servicing residential mortgage loans, those persons performing loan modification or foreclosure relief services in connection with such loans and certain entities involved in the transfer of MSR.
Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act imposed a number of requirements on mortgage originators and servicers of residential mortgage loans, significantly increased the penalties for noncompliance with certain consumer protection laws and also established new standards and practices for mortgage originators and servicers. Subsequent to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has issued, and is expected to continue to issue, various rules that impact mortgage servicing and originations, including: periodic billing statements; certain notices and acknowledgments; prompt crediting of borrowers’ accounts for payments received; additional notice, review and timing requirements with respect to delinquent borrowers; prompt investigation of complaints by borrowers; additional requirements before purchasing insurance to protect the lender’s interest in the property; certain customer service benchmarks for servicers; servicers’ obligations to establish reasonable policies and procedures; requirements to provide information about mortgage loss mitigation options to delinquent borrowers; rules governing the scope, timing, content and format of disclosures to consumers regarding the interest rate adjustments of their variable-rate transactions; establishing certain requirements relating to billing statements, payment crediting and the provision of payoff statements; preventing or limiting servicers of residential mortgage loans from taking certain actions (e.g. the charging of certain fees); requirements for determining prospective borrowers’ abilities to repay their mortgages; removing incentives for higher cost mortgages; prohibiting prepayment penalties for non-qualified mortgages; prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses; requiring additional disclosures to potential borrowers; restricting the fees that mortgage originators may collect; requiring new mortgage loan disclosures that integrate the TILA disclosures with the RESPA disclosures for certain covered transactions; and other new requirements, in each case either increasing costs and risks related to servicing and originations or reducing revenues currently generated.

Recently, the only reverse mortgage loan product we have originated is the HECM, an FHA-insured loan that must comply with FHA and other regulatory requirements. Accordingly, many of the recent federal legal changes affecting our reverse mortgage business relate to the HECM. On September 3, 2013, the FHA announced changes to the HECM program, pursuant to authority under the Reverse Mortgage Stabilization Act, signed into law on August 9, 2013. The changes impact initial mortgage insurance premiums and principal limit factors, impose restrictions on the amount of funds that senior borrowers may draw down at closing and during the first 12 months after closing, and require a financial assessment for all HECM borrowers to ensure they have the capacity and willingness to meet their financial obligations and the terms of the reverse mortgage. Key components of the financial assessment include a credit history and property charge payment history analysis, a cash flow/residual income analysis, and an analysis of compensating factors and extenuating circumstances to determine if the applicant is eligible for a HECM loan. In addition, the changes require borrowers to set aside a portion of the loan proceeds they receive at closing (or withhold a portion of monthly loan disbursements) for the payment of property taxes and homeowners insurance based on the results of the financial assessment. The new HECM requirements generally became effective on September 30, 2013, with the new financial assessment requirements and funding requirements for the payment of property charges taking effect on April 27, 2015.
State Law
We are also subject to extensive state licensing, statutory and regulatory requirements as a mortgage servicer, loan originator and debt collector throughout the U.S. We are subject to ongoing supervision, audits and examinations conducted by state regulators, including periodic requests from state and other agencies for records, documents and information regarding our policies, procedures and business practices.
State laws affecting our businesses have also been evolving. Some changes have occurred on a nationwide basis at the state level due to the establishment and/or amendment of minimum standards under federal law, such as state licensing requirements. Some states may seek to incorporate federal requirements as a requirement imposed on a state licensed entity, while other states may seek to impose their own additional requirements to the extent not preempted under federal law. Additionally, there have been growing trends in state lawmaking focusing on the servicing of mortgage loans related to, for example, data privacy, loan modifications and anti-foreclosure measures. 
Recent Regulatory Developments
Servicing Segment
On August 4, 2016, the CFPB announced a final rule addressing changes to existing mortgage servicing rules under Regulation X of RESPA and Regulation Z of TILA. The new final rule clarifies, revises and amends provisions regarding, among other things, force-placed insurance, early intervention and loss mitigation requirements under Regulation X and prompt crediting and periodic statement requirements under Regulation Z. The final rule also addresses proper compliance regarding certain servicing requirements when a person is a potential or confirmed successor in interest, is a debtor in bankruptcy, or sends a cease communication request under the FDCPA. The final rule also makes technical corrections to several provisions of Regulation X and Regulation Z. The majority of the requirements under the final rule are expected to take effect on October 19, 2017. 
The CFPB also issued an interpretive rule under the FDCPA relating to servicers' compliance with certain mortgage servicing rules. Most of the provisions of the final rule are expected to take effect on October 19, 2017, and the provisions relating to successors in interest and the provisions relating to periodic statements for borrowers in bankruptcy are expected to take effect April 19, 2018.

There have been various legal and regulatory developments in Nevada regarding liens asserted by homeowner’s associations for unpaid assessments. In September 2014, the Nevada Supreme Court held that an HOA non-judicial foreclosure sale can extinguish a mortgage lender’s previously-recorded first deed of trust on a property if that foreclosure is to recover assessments categorized as super-priority amounts. In June 2015, the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada issued an opinion holding that federal law prohibits an HOA foreclosure proceeding from extinguishing a first deed of trust assigned to Fannie Mae. A Nevada state court subsequently reached the same conclusion. The Nevada Supreme Court also reversed a lower court summary judgment decision invalidating an HOA foreclosure sale on the basis that the HOA refused the lienholder’s tender of the super-priority portion of the lien and that the HOA sale was commercially unreasonable. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled that these were issues of fact and remanded for further proceedings. Additional litigation in both state and federal courts and appellate courts is pending with respect to these issues. Also, new legislation in Nevada, which became effective on October 1, 2015, requires HOAs to provide notice to lienholders relating to the default and foreclosure sale and also to provide creditors with a right to redeem the property for up to 60 days following an HOA foreclosure sale. In January 2017, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that the state’s non-judicial HOA foreclosure statutes in effect prior to the 2015 amendments do not unconstitutionally violate due process and are not a government taking. This opinion conflicts with a 2016 decision of the Ninth Circuit, holding that the statute was unconstitutional. Credit owners may assert claims against servicers for failure to advance sufficient funds to cover unpaid HOA assessments and protect the credit owner’s interest in the subject property. We service numerous loans in Nevada and are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings affected by, or related to, these HOA matters. 
On February 16, 2017, the NY DFS issued its final Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, which regulation sets forth certain minimum standards designed to promote the protection of customer information as well as the information technology systems of regulated entities. This regulation, which took effect on March 1, 2017, requires banks, insurance companies and other entities regulated by the NY DFS, including us, to design a cybersecurity program that addresses their specific risk profile, ensures the safety and soundness of the institution and protects its customers. Except in certain specified instances providing for longer compliance periods or reliance on the use of effective alternative compensating controls, entities subject to the rule generally have 180 days from the effective date to comply with its requirements. We currently expect to comply with such requirements within the specified time periods or rely on the use of alternative compensating controls as permitted by the regulation.
Originations Segment
On October 3, 2015, the CFPB's “Know Before You Owe” mortgage disclosure rule, which amended Regulation X of RESPA and Regulation Z of TILA to integrate certain mortgage loan disclosure forms and requirements, became effective. On July 29, 2016, the CFPB announced a proposed rule that would amend such mortgage disclosure rule in order to formalize guidance about the rule, provide greater clarity and certainty and help facilitate compliance within the mortgage industry. In addition to various clarifications, minor changes, and technical corrections, the proposal makes four substantive changes to the rule: (i) creates tolerances for the total of payments disclosure; (ii) provides for an adjustment of the current partial exemption for certain housing assistance loans to clarify that recording fees and transfer taxes are excluded from the exemption's limitation on costs; (iii) includes all cooperatives under the rule regardless of whether the cooperative is classified as real property under state law; and (iv) incorporates and expands upon previous CFPB webinar guidance concerning the sharing of disclosures with sellers and various other parties. 
On October 15, 2015, the CFPB issued a final rule that will expand the scope of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data reporting requirements while seeking to streamline certain existing requirements. The final rule implements certain changes expressly required by the Dodd-Frank Act as well as additional changes based on the CFPB’s discretionary rulemaking authority, which the CFPB believes will assist in carrying out HMDA's purposes. The amended rule adds new data points for applicant or borrower age, credit score, automated underwriting system information, unique loan identifier, property value, application channel, points and fees, borrower-paid origination charges, discount points, lender credits, loan term, prepayment penalty, non-amortizing loan features, interest rate and loan originator identifier, as well as other data points. The rule also modifies several existing data points. As for types of transactions to be reported, the HMDA rule adopts a dwelling secured standard for transactional coverage, including most closed-end loans and open-end lines of credit secured by a dwelling. The expanded data-collection under the revised rule is expected to begin on January 1, 2018, with reporting expected to begin in 2019.
Reverse Mortgage Segment
On January 19, 2017, HUD published the “Final HECM Rule, FHA: Strengthening the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program.” The primary purpose of the Final HECM Rule was to codify into regulation prior guidance issued by HUD under mortgagee letters authorized by the Reverse Mortgage Stabilization Act of 2013 and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The Final HECM Rule addresses a wide range of reverse mortgage origination and servicing issues, and in certain areas, amends prior guidance and rules. The Final HECM Rule has an effective date of September 19, 2017, and confirms that all existing policies and requirements implemented by HUD mortgagee letters will remain in effect until then.

Federal Regulatory Freeze and Uncertainty
Following the November 2016 Presidential and Congressional elections, a level of heightened uncertainty exists with respect to the future of regulation of mortgage lending and servicing, including the future of the Dodd Frank Act and the CFPB. For example, in January 2017, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum and an Executive Order designed to decrease the number of federal regulations. The memorandum directed executive departments and agencies to freeze new or pending regulations, and the order directed agencies to eliminate at least two existing regulations for every proposed regulation. The Office of Management and Budget subsequently clarified that the Executive Order does not apply to independent agencies such as the CFPB, and the applicability of the Presidential Memorandum to such independent agencies is less clear. These events create uncertainty with regard to final regulations already published in the Federal Register but not yet in effect, such as the CFPB’s amendments to the mortgage servicing rules expected to take effect in October 2017 and the Final HECM Rule expected to take effect in September 2017, and also with regard to proposed rules such as the proposal to amend the CFPB's “Know Before You Owe” mortgage disclosure rule. We cannot predict when these rules will take effect, if at all, nor can we predict the specific legislative or executive actions that may follow or what actions federal and state regulators may take in response to potential changes to the Dodd Frank Act or to the regulatory environment generally.
