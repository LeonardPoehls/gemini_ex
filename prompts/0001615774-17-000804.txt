Item 1.     Business
Introduction 
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware that was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination.
 
On December 20, 2016, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Tema Oil and Gas Company (“Tema”) pursuant to which we will acquire (the “Proposed Business Combination”), assuming no redemptions, approximately 39% of the equity of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tema to be named Rosehill Operating Company, LLC (“Rosehill LLC”), to which Tema will contribute certain assets and liabilities prior to closing of the Proposed Business Combination, for aggregate consideration of $35 million in cash, issuance of 29,807,692 shares of our newly created Class B common stock, 4,000,000 Warrants exercisable for shares of our Class A Common Stock (each entitling the holder to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50) (each, a “Warrant”), additional cash held by us in the trust account and in connection with a private placement of 8.0% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) and Warrants to certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors (the “Private Placement”), and the assumption of $55 million in debt, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. In the Proposed Business Combination, Tema will obtain a majority of our voting shares and will retain a majority of its equity in Rosehill LLC. The Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were approved by our board of directors on December 15, 2016.
 
Tema is an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the exploration, development, acquisition and production of unconventional oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin. Rosehill Operating’s assets are concentrated in the Delaware Basin, a sub-basin of the Permian Basin, and the Fort Worth Basin. In the Delaware Basin, its properties consist of acreage blocks in Loving and Reeves Counties, Texas and Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico. Properties in the Barnett Shale producing area of the Fort Worth Basin are exclusively located in Wise County, Texas.
 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of the Proposed Business Combination by the Company’s stockholders in accordance with the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the completion of a redemption offer whereby the Company will be providing its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Company common stock for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in the Company’s trust account.
 
The Merger Agreement and related agreements are further described in the Form 8-K filed by the Company on December 23, 2016. For additional information regarding the Merger Agreement and the Proposed Business Combination, see the Preliminary Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed by the Company on January 18, 2017, as may be amended from time to time, and the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A when filed by the Company.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this Report does not assume the closing of the Proposed Business Combination.
 
Objective and Business Opportunity
 
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any sector or geographical location, we are focused on the sector that complements our management team’s expertise in the exploration, exploitation, operation and development of crude oil and natural gas wells and related infrastructure, and to capitalize on the ability of our management team to source, screen, evaluate, negotiate, structure, close and manage acquisitions of attractive assets or businesses in the U.S. In the event that we find an acquisition opportunity in a different sector, or in a different geographic region, that is more compelling than the opportunities presented to us in to the U.S. oil and gas industry, we would pursue the opportunity in such other sector or such other geographic region. However, we have not established any particular parameters or criteria as to when we might turn our attention to opportunities outside of the U.S. oil and gas industry. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $400 million to $1 billion.
 
Our strategy is to source, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build, an oil and gas exploration and production (“E&P”) business. E&P companies focus on finding, producing and marketing various forms of crude oil and natural gas. We believe that there is a unique and timely opportunity to achieve attractive returns by acquiring and developing E&P assets in proven basins with known operational and limited geologic risks. We believe this opportunity exists due to several key factors: (i) the recent decline of commodity prices had an immediate and meaningful impact on the cash flows of E&P companies, creating a need for many E&P firms to issue external capital or sell assets, (ii) the recent decline of commodity prices has substantially reduced E&P asset valuations and is moderating drilling and completion costs, and operating costs, resulting in a lower cost to acquire and develop, (iii) the short-term volatility and cyclical nature of commodity prices underpinned by a positive long-term outlook for crude oil and natural gas demand and the need for higher commodity prices to meet expected demand growth and (iv) the advantages enjoyed by E&P companies operating in the U.S., including access to industry-leading technologies and expertise, top-tier oil and gas-producing basins, established infrastructure and favorable political policies relative to other regions.

Competitive Strengths 
 
Our Executive Officers. 
 
We believe our management team is in a prime position to take advantage of opportunities within oil and gas and to create value for our stockholders. Our management team has a long history in oil and gas, with a deep knowledge of the industry and a well-established network of relationships with public and private oil and gas companies, equity sponsors, lending institutions, family offices, attorneys and brokers, from which we expect to generate attractive acquisition opportunities.
Gary C. Hanna has over 30 years of executive experience in the energy exploration and production and service sectors, with a primary focus in the mid-continent U.S. and Gulf of Mexico regions. From 2009 until June 2014, Mr. Hanna served as the Chief Executive Officer of EPL Oil & Gas Inc., or EPL and was elected as a director of EPL in June 2010 and Chairman in 2013. EPL was a public E&P company with a $270 million equity value in 2009 that Mr. Hanna and Ms. Thom, our Chief Financial Officer, grew into a $2.3 billion company by the time it was sold to Energy XXI Ltd. in 2014. Following the reorganization of EPL in September 2009 and within a rising oil price environment in the four years following, the company completed acquisitions of new assets and executed organically through increasing capital spending. This combined approach resulted in a significant increase in proved reserves, production volumes and the company’s drilling portfolio. The acquisitions provided EPL with access to infrastructure and extensive acreage, with significant exploitation and development potential. From 2009, the year the company reorganized, through 2013, the year prior to the sale of the company in June 2014, EPL’s revenue increased from $191.6 million to $693.0 million and net income (loss) increased from $(57.1) million to $85.3 million. The price of oil increased from $55.07 in 2009 to $97.82 in 2013. From 2008 to 2009, Mr. Hanna served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Admiral Energy Services, a start-up company focused on the development of offshore energy services. From 1999 to 2007, Mr. Hanna served in various capacities at Tetra Technologies, Inc., an international oil and gas services production company, including serving as Senior Vice President from 2002 to 2007. Mr. Hanna also served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Tetra’s affiliate, Maritech Resources, Inc., and as President of Tetra Applied Technologies, Inc., another Tetra affiliate. From 1996 to 1998, Mr. Hanna served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Gulfport Energy Corporation, a public oil and gas exploration company. From 1995 to 1998, he also served as the Chief Operations Officer for DLB Oil & Gas, Inc., a mid-continent exploration public company. From 1982 to 1995, Mr. Hanna served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Hanna Oil Properties, Inc., a company engaged in oil services and the development of mid-continent oil and gas prospects. Since November 2015, Mr. Hanna has served as a member of the boards of directors of Hercules Offshore, Inc. and Aspire Holdings Corp.
Edward Kovalik has been the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Partner of KLR Group, LLC (“KLR Group”), KLR Group Holdings, LLC and certain of KLR Holdings’ direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, “KLR Holdings”), an investment bank specializing in the energy sector which he co-founded in the spring of 2012. Mr. Kovalik manages the firm and focuses on structuring bespoke financing solutions for the firm’s clients. Mr. Kovalik has over 17 years of experience as an investment banker. Prior to founding KLR Holdings, from 2002 until April 2012, Mr. Kovalik served in various capacities at Rodman & Renshaw, most recently as Head of Capital Markets and the head of Rodman’s Energy Investment Banking team. From 1999 to 2002, Mr. Kovalik was a Vice President at Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., where he focused on private placement transactions for public companies. Mr. Kovalik has served as a member of the boards of directors of River Bend Oil and Gas, LLC since June 2013 and Marathon Patent Group, Inc. a public company, since April 2014.
Tiffany J. (“T.J.”) Thom has more than 20 years of financial and operational experience in the energy industry. Ms. Thom served in various capacities for EPL from October 2000 until June 2014. Ms. Thom served as Principal Financial Officer of EPL from July 2009, as Senior Vice President of Business Development from September 2009, as Chief Financial Officer from June 2010 and as Executive Vice President from January 2014, to June 2014. Ms. Thom helped lead EPL through its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding which culminated in 2009. From 1992 to 2000, Ms. Thom served as Senior Reservoir Engineer for Exxon Production Company and ExxonMobil Company with operational roles, including reservoir engineering and subsurface completion engineering for numerous offshore Gulf of Mexico properties. Ms. Thom has served as a member of the board of directors of Yates Petroleum Corporation since October 2015 and as a member of the board of directors of Patterson-UTI Energy Inc. since August 2014.

Gregory R. Dow has served as the Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel of KLR Holdings since April 2012. Mr. Dow was General Counsel at Rodman & Renshaw Capital Group, Inc. from February 2008 until April 2012 and a Managing Director and the Deputy General Counsel at Cowen and Company, LLC from May 2004 until December 2007. From 1998 through 2004, Mr. Dow was a Director and the Equity Capital Markets Counsel at Merrill Lynch, serving in New York and in London, where he covered the UK, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Prior to that, he was Equity Capital Markets Counsel at Peregrine Capital Markets in Hong Kong, which at the time was the largest independent investment bank in Asia. Mr. Dow began his legal career at the law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy, where he focused on Latin America. Mr. Dow also had five years of experience in strategic consulting with Taylor Research and Greenwich Associates, where he focused on telecommunications, media and financial industry clients.
Our Board of Directors. We have assembled a group of independent directors who bring us public company governance, executive leadership, operations oversight, private equity investment management and capital markets experience. Our Board members have extensive experience, having served as directors, CEOs, CFOs and in other executive and advisory capacities for numerous publicly-listed and privately-owned companies and private equity firms. Our directors have experience with acquisitions, divestitures and corporate strategy and implementation, which we believe will be of significant benefit to us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates as well as following the completion of our initial business combination.
 
Status as a Public Company 
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this process a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
Financial Position 
 
With funds available for a business combination currently in the amount of approximately $85.6 million (including approximately $228,000 held outside the trust account at December 31, 2016) assuming no redemptions, less $46,330 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Conflicts of Interest 
 
An affiliate of ours, KLR Group, is a registered broker-dealer operating in the oil and gas sector. KLR Group undertakes a wide range of financial advisory, merchant and investment banking, research and sales and trading activities for a wide variety of clients, including public and private companies in the oil and gas sector. Accordingly, there may be situations in which KLR Group has an obligation or an interest that actually or potentially conflicts with our interests. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and, as a result, we may be denied certain investment opportunities or may be otherwise disadvantaged in some situations by our relationship to KLR Group.
 
KLR Group is regulated by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA. KLR Group’s merchant banking business generally targets transactions of a similar size as those that would be suitable for our initial business combination, and thus may compete with us for one or more potential targets. Further, other investors in affiliates of ours and KLR Group’s may be in direct competition with us for a possible target for our initial business combination. KLR Group may also choose to operate, or have an interest in, investment entities similar to us or that otherwise compete with us in the future.
 
7


Other clients of KLR Group’s advisory business may also compete with us for investment opportunities meeting our investment objectives. If KLR Group is engaged to act for any such clients, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within KLR Group, including by Mr. Kovalik and other persons who may make decisions for the company, may be suitable for both us and for an investment banking client or a current or future KLR Group internal investment vehicle, including other blank check companies in which KLR Group may participate, and may be directed to such client or investment vehicle rather than to us. KLR Group’s advisory business may also be engaged to advise the seller of a company, business or assets that would qualify as an investment opportunity for us. In such cases, we may be precluded from participating in the sale process or from purchasing the company, business or assets. If we are permitted to pursue the opportunity, KLR Group’s interests or its obligations to the seller will diverge from our interests. Neither KLR Group nor members of our management who are also employed by KLR Group have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware unless such opportunity was expressly offered in writing to our management solely in their capacity as officers or directors of the company. KLR Group and/or our management, in their capacities as officers of KLR Group or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future KLR Group internal investment vehicles, including other blank check companies in which KLR Group may participate, or third parties, including clients of KLR Group, before they present such opportunities to us. In addition, our President, Edward Kovalik, is a director of River Bend Oil & Gas, LLC, a private company operating in the oil and gas sector, and our other executive officers are affiliated either with KLR Group or with other companies in the oil and gas industry. In addition, our independent directors (expected to be appointed just prior to the consummation of our public offering) may have pre-existing duties or obligations that prevent them from presenting otherwise suitable target businesses to us. Our independent directors will be under no obligation to present opportunities of which they become aware to the company unless such opportunity was expressly offered to the independent director solely in his capacity as a director of the company.
 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business or businesses with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Subsequent to a business combination, we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
None of the members of our management team, the sponsor, KLR Group or KLR Holdings has previous experience as sponsor or in a management capacity with other blank check companies.
 
Effecting our Initial Business Combination 
 
General 
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If the entire purchase price of our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or if not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, to pay $46,330 in deferred underwriting commissions or for working capital.
 
Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
 
8


We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.

At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination 
 
The NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or an independent investment banking firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in connection with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test.
 
To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
In connection with the consummation of our business combination, or thereafter, we may retain KLR Group to provide certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services for which they may receive fees upon consummation of such business combination or thereafter. The amount of fees we pay to KLR Group will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services rendered by comparable investment banks for such transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committee’s policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest. KLR Group will not be asked to render a fairness opinion with respect to our initial business combination as KLR Group may have a conflict of interest by virtue of its affiliation with our sponsor. As a consequence, we may be required to retain another firm to render such an opinion if one is required.
 
Lack of business diversification 
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

· | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Limited ability to evaluate the target’s management team 
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination 
 
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.
 

Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required
--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | | No 
Merger of the company with a target | | Yes

 
Under NASDAQ’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
 

· | we issue common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | any of our directors, executive officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Permitted purchases of our securities 
 
In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
 
In the event that our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, executive officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Any purchases by our sponsor, executive officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.

Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination 
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $85.3 million in the trust account, and the conversion amount per share in any subsequent business combination or liquidation would have been approximately $10.42 per public share. Our initial stockholders, executive officers and directors have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

· | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to purchase will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

· | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file proxy materials with the SEC. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
12


If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. The founder shares held by our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination, and our executive officers and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. Public stockholders may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or if we conduct a tender offer. In addition, our initial stockholders, executive officers and directors have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
 
Tendering stock certificates in connection with redemption rights 
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The proxy materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $35.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholders meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination.
 
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.

If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until September 16, 2017.
 
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination 
 
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed to complete our initial business combination by September 16, 2017. If we are unable to complete our business combination by September 16, 2017, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by September 16, 2017.
 
Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by September 16, 2017. However, if our initial stockholders (or any of our executive officers, directors or affiliates) acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by September 16, 2017.
 
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow holders to redeem their public shares unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules).
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from approximately $228,000 in cash held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2016), and our sponsor’s commitment to loan us up to an additional amount of $100,000 for working capital purposes (of which we have not borrowed any amount under this commitment as of December 31, 2016), although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.40. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.40. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, Mr. Kovalik has agreed to be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.40 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then Mr. Kovalik will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that Mr. Kovalik would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other executive officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
14


In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.40 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes, and Mr. Kovalik asserts that he is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Mr. Kovalik to enforce his indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Mr. Kovalik to enforce his indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.40 per share.
 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that Mr. Kovalik will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Mr. Kovalik will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2016, we have access to up to approximately $228,000 in cash held outside the trust account and our sponsor’s commitment to loan us up to an additional amount of $100,000 for working capital purposes (of which we have not borrowed any amount under this commitment as of December 31, 2016). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by September 16, 2017 may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. Delaware law provides that if a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by September 16, 2017, is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination by September 16, 2017, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following September 16, 2017 and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
15


Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.
 
As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.40 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay income taxes, and less any per-share amounts distributed from our trust account to our public stockholders in the event we are unable to complete our business combination by September 16, 2017 and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Mr. Kovalik will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.40 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination by September 16, 2017 or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
 
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholders, executive officers and directors have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

· | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of income taxes payable) in each case subject to the limitations described herein; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
16



· | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | if our initial business combination is not consummated by September 16, 2017, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock, and then only if we allow dissenting holders the opportunity to get their pro rata share from the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting.
 
Competition 
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we have encountered, and may continue to encounter, intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees 
 
We currently have four executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any members of our management will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 
Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As long as we maintain our status as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
