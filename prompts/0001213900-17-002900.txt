Item 1. Business.
General Overview
 
We are a pioneer and leading developer of cutting-edge secure cashless payment solutions providing global enterprises with innovative technology for over two decades. We operate in two main segments: (1) Retail and Mass Transit Ticketing; and (2) Petroleum. In addition to our two reportable segments, certain products for the medical industry and other secure smart card solutions are classified under “Other” in segment analysis appearing in this Annual Report.
 
Our field-proven suite of cashless payment solutions is based on an extensive IP portfolio including registered patents and patent applications worldwide. Since our incorporation in 1990, we have built an international reputation for reliability and innovation, deploying a large number of solutions for the unattended retail, mass transit, banking, medical and petroleum industries.
 
We operate a global network of regional offices, distributors and partners to support various solutions deployed across the globe.
 
We focus our efforts on our core business of providing innovative cashless payment solutions based among other things on our contactless near field communications, or NFC, technology. To this end, and in line with our efforts to focus on our core business, in September 2016 we completed the sale of the operations, including our employees, as well as intellectual property directly related to our parking business. We have increased our efforts to further develop existing and new products and solutions, including among others by the introduction of our new products and solutions for the unattended payment market and Internet of Payment Things, or IoPT, technology. We have also increased our sales and marketing activities and resources.
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel on February 15, 1990, under the name of De-Bug Innovations Ltd., with unlimited duration.  Our name was changed to On Track Innovations Ltd. on July 8, 1991. We are registered with the Israeli Registrar of Companies, under registration number 52-004286-2 and our Ordinary Shares are traded in the NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ, under the symbol OTIV. 
 
Our Markets
 
We provide our cashless payment solutions for three major vertical markets:
 

1. | Retail and Mass Transit Ticketing 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


a. | Self-Service (Unattended) Retail, Internet of Payment Things (IoPT) and Wearables 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Self-Service (Unattended) Retail - NFC and contactless technologies are embraced globally to create cashless retail environments known as self-service or unattended - a type of retail business where customers help themselves with respect to the products or services they wish to purchase, using NFC and contactless to accept the payment. Examples of business models that permit their customers an aspect of self-service include vending, laundromats, kiosks, gaming, banking, mass transit and self-service (self-checkout). As one of the pioneers of cashless payment technology, we have been working closely with companies in diverse industries and markets to design industry-tailored solutions that enable our customers to achieve their goals more efficiently. Internet of Payment Things (IoPT) and Wearables – Wearable technologies have become a modern trend. Today, it is very common to find wearable technologies such as wristbands or watches that are not only fashion garments, but are also linked to a smartphone and can measure a person’s heartbeat and footsteps. We believe that the next evolution of wearables will also allow cashless payment. Our expertise in minimizing the foot print of NFC payment devices allows us to offer manufacturers a way to easily turn their existing product into a payment device. We call this unique capability “PayEnable” and we intend to market products that include our technology with the “PayEnabled by OTI” mark. Our goal is that pay-enabling a product will be cost-effective and will require no expertise or special tooling from the merchant or the consumer. PayEnabled devices will support contactless payment similar to pre-paid, debit and credit cards. Additionally, PayEnabled products will also be able to support mass transit ticketing, e-coupons, loyalty programs and healthcare applications, and could also be used for proximity marketing (in-store promotions) and product authenticating (brand anti-counterfeiting). We manage our cashless payment solutions for the retail market worldwide from our headquarters in Israel.

Industry Background
 
Following recent regulations and credit card anti-fraud legislations, the use of contactless payment technologies has become an essential requirement for both consumers and retailers. Various market sectors have begun to massively adopt contactless payments and are constantly looking for ways to make the adoption process as convenient as possible for both merchants and customers. Millions of contactless debit and credit cards are issued annually by leading financial institutions to various consumers, and merchants are looking to install contactless payment readers that can be easily integrated into their existing unattended point of sale locations.
 
The world's leading smartphone manufacturers are either including or are expected to include NFC support in their upcoming handset upgrades, which will enhance the technology adoption lifecycle. Whether it is a standard contactless travel card, or EMV contactless card, or an NFC mobile phone, the main motive is to provide quick and efficient payment solutions. Leading smartphone manufacturers have also introduced and are actively pushing the use of their own contactless payment solutions such as Apple Pay™, Android Pay™ and Samsung Pay™, all of which require a contactless reader to be available at the merchant countertop.
The IoPT wearable devices – commonly referred to as wearables – market is expected to continue growing rapidly as second and third generation iterations reach the market. These new devices will build upon the hardware and software of their predecessors and answer some of the shortcomings and concerns that potential customers have today. With the growth in the wearables market, many product and apparel manufacturers are looking for ways to keep their products current and attractive. Adding cashless payment technology is an interesting and cost effective way to achieve this, and OTI’s PayEnable technology is in a commanding position to capitalize on the current wearables boom.
 
 Strategy
 
Our goal is to maintain our status as a leading developer of NFC and cashless payment technologies and our reputation as a manufacturer of top quality products carrying the highest certification standards. We see growing potential in our PayEnable technology and are working to position ourselves as an innovative market leader in the retail segment.
 
Key elements of our strategy for achieving this goal include:
 

● | Expanding our global market presence. We market our products through a global network of subsidiaries in the United States, Europe, Africa and our headquarters in Israel. We are using these entities to strengthen our presence in existing markets, penetrate new markets, provide local customer service and technical support, and adapt our products to our local customers’ specific needs. We continue to expand our market presence via strategic distributors around the globe. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing our focus on generating high-margin, recurring revenues. We currently derive most of our revenues from one-time payments for our products and technologies. We intend to generate additional recurring revenues by receiving service fees for ongoing customer services and transaction fees from our customers. We also seek to enter the payment ecosystem by providing complementary services to our PayEnabled products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhancing our technological position. We intend to continue to invest in research and development in order to develop new technologies, extend the functionality of our products and services, and offer innovative products and services to our customers.

We provide our customers with training and installation support and ongoing customer service and technical support through our global network of subsidiaries, distributors and local services providers, including employees located in our corporate headquarters in Rosh Pina, Israel, as well as employees located in our subsidiaries in Europe, South Africa and the United States. Our customer service teams in Rosh Pina provide central services to our global network. Our subsidiaries, distributors and local providers, in turn, provide customer service and technical support through telephone and email for an ongoing fee. On-site technical support is available to customers and end-users for a fee.
Sales and Marketing
 
In addition to selling our products through our distributors, we sell and market our products directly and through our global network of subsidiaries. We have also engaged consultants to market and sell our products in the Asia-Pacific region. We market and sell our products in the Americas through our U.S.-based subsidiary OTI America, in Africa through our subsidiary based in South Africa, OTI PetroSmart and in Europe through ASEC, our Polish subsidiary. In Israel and in regions where we do not have local subsidiaries or representatives, we market and sell through our headquarters in Rosh Pina. Our marketing and sales staff implements marketing programs to promote our products and services in order to enhance our global brand recognition. Our current marketing efforts include, among others, participation in trade shows and conferences, press releases, our web site, face-to-face engagements, and advertisements in industry publications. We also conduct from time to time technical seminars to inform customers, distributors, business partners and other industry participants of the benefits of our products and technologies.
 
Some of the customers to whom we sell our products also act as distributors for our products. We have granted some of our customers and local distributors exclusive distribution rights within a particular country or region. We generally guarantee exclusivity only against certain minimum volume commitments or other commercial conditions determined on a case by case basis.
 
 Manufacturing
 
We outsource all of our manufacturing and product assembly to third-party vendors. Whenever possible, our policy is to use more than one supplier and manufacturing subcontractor for each part of our production process in order to limit dependence on any one manufacturer or supplier.
 
We maintain strict internal and external quality control processes. We have and maintain ISO 9001:2008 certification for our Israeli headquarters and our subsidiary OTI America. We require that our suppliers and manufacturing and assembly vendors have and maintain ISO 9001:2008 certification. ISO 9001:2008 refers to a quality assurance model established by International Standards Organization, or ISO, for companies that design, produce, install, inspect and test products.
 
Government Regulation
 
Most of our products are subject to local electromagnetic (EMC)/Radio regulations such as radiation, conducted emission and immunity, and safety regulations such as fire and electric hazards, governed by low voltage standards for our regular readers and hazardous areas standards for our petroleum products, relevant in the countries in which they are used. In the United States, EMC/radio testing and certification for such products are governed by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Part 15 while safety testing and certification fall under the standards set by UL, LLC, a public safety and testing certification organization (UL). In the rest of the world, where FCC and UL rules do not apply, we follow various local standards for EMC/radio and safety. The compliance with these standards is assured by testing and certifying our products at various accredited labs and/or notified bodies located both in Israel and other countries (e.g. United States, Germany, South Africa, India, China, Brazil and more). Our products are in compliance with the foregoing regulations.
Research and Development
 
We believe that our future success depends on, among other things, our ability to maintain our technological leadership, enhance our existing products and develop new products technologies and solutions. Accordingly, we intend to continue devoting substantial resources to research and development.
