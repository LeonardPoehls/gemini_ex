Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars.  1    Corporate History and Overview
  We were incorporated pursuant to the laws of Nevada on May 19, 2010 under the name Lisboa Leisure, Inc. On October 18, 2013, we amended our articles of incorporation in order to change our name to GroGenesis, Inc. and to affect a forward split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock such that every one share of common stock issued and outstanding prior to the split be exchanged for 25 post-split shares of common stock and that the Company's post-forward split authorized capital consisted of 200,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. The name change and split were conditions precedent to our asset acquisition agreements with Joseph Fewer of Aylmer, Ontario and Steven Moseley of Paris, Tennessee, whereby we agreed to purchase certain assets necessary for the operation of a plant growth surfactant manufacture and sales business.  On September 9, 2013, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Joseph Fewer and Stephen Moseley, whereby we agreed to acquire all rights, title, and interest in and to the assets relating to our initial product, AgraBurst, (the APA). In consideration of Joseph Fewer selling the intellectual property comprising AgraBurst to us, including the technology described in the United States provisional patent application number 61/897,584 - "Composition and Method for Enhancing Plant Growth", as well as all related assets necessary for operating a plant growth enhancement product manufacture and sales business as a going concern, we issued to Mr. Fewer 12,500,000 post forward-split common shares in our capital. The APA also required that we complete a forward split of our common stock such that 25 new shares of common stock are exchanged for each currently issued share of common stock outstanding, and that 74,000,000 shares of post-forward-split common stock held by our former president be returned to treasury. We completed this forward-split on November 1, 2013.  During our fiscal years ending May 31, 2017 and 2016, we developed further enhancements to our AgraBurst formula to make it an all-natural, premium organic, non-GMO nano-surfactant for farmers, fertilizer manufacturers and commercial lawn and turf companies. AgraBurst PRO is an agricultural input which we believe enhances the ability of the plant to more efficiently use the added nutrients incorporated in fertilizers, which results in less fertilizer required. We believe the application of AgraBurst PRO can begin the process of improving the health of the soil while minimizing the use of conventional chemical agricultural inputs.  Throughout this Annual Report, AgraBurst PRO shall be referred to as AgraBurst PRO or the Product.  Business Description
  We are a sustainable agricultural services enterprise offering food growers and turf producers an organic, nano-surfactant that enhances soil and crop health. Our flagship product, AgraBurst PRO, is a proprietary, all-natural, non-GMO agricultural input which improves the ability of the plant (crop, turf, tree, vine etc.) to enhance the efficient access of added nutrients incorporated in fertilizers, resulting in less fertilizer needed as well as improved water retention in soil. By optimizing the plant's uptake of applied pest and weed controls and fertilizers, producers can minimize other input costs while reducing the health risk to farm workers due to its non-toxic properties. AgraBurst PRO (the Product) is formulated for organic and non-GMO producers and those food growers seeking to convert to non-GMO and organic food production. We believe the application of our Product can begin the process of improving the health of the soil while reducing the use of conventional chemical agricultural inputs. Our strategy is to capitalize on the convergence of consumer demand, retailer demand/compliance and legislative drive toward environmental responsibility.     2    Our Product
  AgraBurst PRO is a specialized proprietary, premium organic, nano-surfactant, non-ionic (neutral charge) formulation of high quality food-grade ingredients with beneficial soil health and plant stimulant properties with significant potential to increase yields. It acts as an environmentally-safe additive to producers' spray solution that enhances delivery and absorption activity in both soil and plant tissue by reducing the surface tension between the spray droplet and leaf surface, creating an adhesive liquid bond. The spray droplets spread across the leaf surface thereby increasing the coverage area and plant exposure, resulting in the spray droplets sticking to the leaf surface where absorption is maximized instead of running off the leaf surface. The Product enables the spray droplet to penetrate the leafs surface barrier (a waxy layer known as the cuticle) to improve absorption into the plants tissue and more effectively deliver the most efficient and recognizable form of nutrient, fertilizer and microbiology solutions. AgraBurst PRO creates a Cationic Exchange Capacity (CEC) substrate, so that positively charged nutrients are held within the soil and not leached away and reducing the amount of fertilizer needed.  Our Product performs as a purified and activated organic matter carbon source and serves as an ideal additive to improve and accelerate the performance of all fertilizer programs. It is non-toxic, completely biodegradable and, unlike synthetic chemicals or petroleum-based surfactants, will not bio-accumulate in the environment and tie up fertilizers and other valuable trace elements. By decreasing water evaporation from the soil and increasing water retention, the Product renders plants to be more drought-resistant by developing stronger roots which are more able to withstand adverse weather conditions (wind and drought) and reach nutrients and water not available near the surface of the soil.  The Product also converts sustained plant energy into having a higher sugar holding capacity by acting as an organic electrolyte. It not only increases the plants oxygen uptake capacity and nutrient conversion through photosynthesis by improving chlorophyll production resulting in greener and healthier leaves, but also increases the stomata (root) opening and transpiration (sweating), which is the primary nutrient exchange for soil microbiology which results in plants being fed more efficiently. The foliar nano-surfactant improves the plants enzymatic processes, resulting in the stimulation of the plants immune system, reducing the need for pest and fungicide control application. The plants natural oils in the formulation protect from infection and deter pests and fungus. Significantly for the enhancement of soil health, AgraBurst PRO also stimulates microbial activity in the soil to de-compact soil with the natural plant extracts that provide vital trace elements and minerals which nutritionally supplement both the plant and soil microorganisms.  Agricultural Nano-Surfactant Industry
  The agricultural nano-surfactant category is in its relative infancy but, due to impressive results in the field, the sector is beginning to attract more investment in research. Management believes that, as the full potential of organic nano-surfactants are realized by users, optimizing nutrient uptake by plants and increasing crop yields, a rapidly growing market will develop in the agricultural industry. We believe that this relatively new agricultural nano-surfactant sector is promising, largely untapped, and currently has few competitors focused on penetrating the sustainable agriculture market.  Our Product targets the organic and non-GMO food production sector, but a growing market is conventional food growers who are seeking to convert to non-GMO and organic food production. With the advent of GMO labeling legislation, it is expected that consumer and the farming sectors interest in sustainable farming alternatives will continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Our mission is to utilize our sustainable solutions to capitalize on this convergence of consumer demand, retailer demand/compliance and legislative drive toward environmental responsibility.    3    Another very large market is farmers that are still using chemical fertilizers and have not made the decision to transition to non-GMO and organic food production, but are motivated to begin to restrict their chemical inputs and increase their crop yields. Field testing with the Product conducted in South America and South East Asia have recorded economically relevant increases in crop production. Although management cannot be certain, that in all cases, a significant increase in yield will occur with the Product due to other variables such as original soil condition, groundwater quality, weather and pest infestations, field testing has indicated that crop production is usually enhanced.  In 2014, the United States had 14,093 organic farms producing $5.5 billion in organic products with a continuing trend of substantial growth. Of the $5.5 billion in 2014 organic sales, 60% was organic crop sales, an increase of 69% from 2008 to 2014. The market for conventional farmers transitioning to an organic/non-GMO food production model has also been experiencing rapid growth. According to a study by Clive James in 2015, the global area of GMO crops as measured by hectares declined from 2014 to 2015, the first decline since 1996.  We intend to pursue another promising market for AgraBurst PRO, which is the turf grower and maintenance market. Groundskeepers for stadiums, parks, golf courses and individual lawns have been challenged for years to ensure that the grass/turf they were maintaining looked healthy and green by heavy use of fertilizers and weed control. In the field, users have noted how rapidly our Product enhances the color and quality of lawns and grounds while reducing the need for the heavy use of fertilizers and herbicides. We believe that the well-documented concern of fertilizer runoff into streams and ponds, oftentimes resulting in algae blooms in standing water, has provided us with a significant market for additional sales. Additionally, the turf market in the United States is a twelve-month selling season.  Product Safety
  AgraBurst PRO is formulated with natural refined extracts that originate from tree oils and plants and are considered environmentally-friendly and organic. AgraBurst PRO is free of genetically modified organisms (GMO).  Market for Our Product
  As consumers become increasingly concerned over the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers on food crops, the infiltration of harmful crop additives in soil and water supplies, and the availability of food products at reasonable prices, there is growing pressure on global farmers to provide safe food products for consumption without causing undue environmental harm. Consumer demand for organic and non-GMO food has been increasing year-to-year, with consumer concern enshrined in recent GMO-labeling laws. With the willingness by consumers to pay premium prices for healthy food, food producers, depending upon their current operations, are increasingly interested in minimizing or eliminating the use of chemical inputs, maintaining their current organic and non-GMO production model or transitioning from conventional GMO food production to organic and/or non-GMO production.  Our Product provides a sustainable solution to maximizing fertilizer and insect and fungus control inputs for a broad market of crops including coffee plants, rice, palms, cassava, sugar cane, bananas, wheat, corn, tobacco, fruit trees, vineyards, leafy vegetables, corn, wheat, potatoes, turf/sod, citrus trees, sorghum (and other silage) and ornamentals.  Our Product is targeted at three broad target markets as follows:  · Farmers growing produce organically and non-GMO; · Farmers growing produce conventionally (using chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides) desiring the optimal uptake of all applied inputs to the plant and increased crop yield; and · Farmers interested in converting from conventional GMO food production to organic and/or non-GMO food production.  We envision our initial prime markets to be human food and silage producers, fruit tree (including citrus tree growers), vineyard growers and sod and turf growers and groundskeepers.  4   International Markets
  We plan to operate both domestically and internationally. We currently have established distributor relationships in the following territories:  
Distributor | Territory 
GroGenesis Caribbean Solutions, Inc. | Cuba, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Barbados, Belize, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Montserrat, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin / St Maarten, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and the United States Virgin Islands
Vita Agro S.A.S. | Central Ameerica (Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panamá) and South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Perú, Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia, Argentina and Uruguay) 
JAK International | Bangladesh 


In addition, we are in the process of building relationships, which involve agricultural testing of our Product with other international agricultural distributors in the countries of Cuba, Myanmar and Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Sri Lanka. Finalized distribution agreements may include multiple countries in a region depending upon the specific distributors market, experience and operational expertise.

Competition

Because the agricultural nano-surfactant is a nascent industry, there are no dominant, large competitors focused on the sector. However, our ability to market our Products in North America may be adversely impacted by the fragmented and competitive nature of the agriculture fertilizer and fertilizer enhancement industry. The sector includes large companies that produce fertilizers in massive quantities, as well as small, boutique manufacturers that produce fertilizers and growth enhancement products in small batches.

While the principal competitive factors in the sale of fertilizer enhancement products are crop output and product safety, pricing and availability of the product and geographic coverage are also critical. Most of our competitors have an established market for their products and greater financial resources and may be better able to withstand sales or price decreases. We also expect to face competition from new market entrants on an ongoing basis. We may be unable to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Well-established and well-known companies such as Syngenta, Bayer CropScience, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Monsanto, DuPont, Makhteshim Agan, Nufarm, Sumitomo Chemical, and FMC service the crop protection sector with traditional agrochemicals, but could be considered indirect competitors.

Sales and Marketing

Our marketing strategy is to demonstrate to our potential end-use customers, principally commercial farmers and turf groundskeepers, that our Product will increase their agricultural output and enhance the health of their soil. We intend to prove these results through a combination of independent product testing through scientific trials and by providing farmers with our Product on a trial basis. We expect that our marketing strategy will be most successful if farmers are able to realize improvements in crop quality, crop yield and soil health.

We intend to sell our Product through distribution arrangements with independent agricultural input distributors. We are subject to the risk that large, high-profile, distributors could exert substantial pressure on us due to their size and the small contribution that our products would likely have to their financial success. Because of this difference in market influence, such distributors could have leverage over the pricing and promotion of AgraBurst PRO.

We hope to enter into agreements with both national and international distributors, though there is no guarantee that we will be successful in reaching such arrangements. Although there are no plans to bring distribution services in-house, in the event we change plans and decide to directly control product distribution, we will incur costs related to taking and processing product orders from retailers, shipping and warehousing costs, credit, collections, and in-house accounting fees.

Government Regulation

While agricultural fertilizers, soil amendments, and related products are highly regulated at the state level in the United States, these regulations do not apply to our Product because it is a crop surfactant that is comprised of less than 3% nitrogen. We anticipate that we will incur periodic testing costs in order to ensure that our Product qualifies as a crop surfactant and is not deemed to be a fertilizer or similarly regulated product that is subject to regulatory requirements.
Intellectual Property

We currently have no patents on our products. Where available, we intend to obtain trademark protection in the United States for a number of trademarks for slogans and product designs. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secret, unfair competition, trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property, including product design, proprietary formulas, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of patents and trademark registrations, the maintenance of trade secrets, the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights. The trademark for AgraBurst has been approved as of August 26, 2014 and is currently active under Registration Number 4594428.

While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks will protect our proprietary information, we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights could result in a substantial cost to, and diversion of effort by, our company, management believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights will be a key component of our sales and operating strategy.

Compliance with Environmental Laws

Our current operations are not subject to any environmental laws. All of the ingredients in our Product meet or exceed most organic and non-GMO blending and application protocols.
Facilities

We have formed a strategic partnership to streamline our business expense overhead by sourcing out blending and manufacturing functions to United Agricultural Services, Inc. (UAS) of Florida. Since 1993, UAS researches, manufactures and markets one of the largest lines of high quality biological, organic/natural fertilizers, foliar nutrients and natural biodegradable soil conditioners. UAS also provides outsourcing services that we will be utilizing, including custom blending, warehousing and logistics for many sustainable agriculture firms operating domestically and globally. Our Product will be blended at UASs 40,000 plus square foot facility located in Panasoffkee, Florida.
