Item 1: Business Overview
BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
CIT Group Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively "we", "our", "CIT" or the "Company"), is a bank holding company ("BHC") and a financial holding company ("FHC") with $44.8 billion of earning assets at December 31, 2017. CIT was formed in 1908 and provides financing, leasing and advisory services principally to middle-market companies and small businesses in a wide variety of industries, primarily in North America. CIT also provides banking and related services to commercial and individual customers through our banking subsidiary, CIT Bank, N.A.

COMMERCIAL BANKING
Commercial Banking is comprised of four divisions, Commercial Finance, Rail, Real Estate Finance, and Business Capital.
Commercial Banking provides a range of lending, leasing and deposit products, as well as ancillary products and services, including factoring, cash management and advisory services, primarily to small and medium-sized companies, as well as to the rail industry. Revenue is generated from interest earned on loans, rents on equipment leased, fees and other revenue from lending and leasing activities, and banking services, along with capital markets transactions and commissions earned on factoring and related activities. We source our commercial lending business primarily through direct marketing to borrowers, lessees, manufacturers, vendors and distributors, and through referral sources and other intermediaries. Periodically we buy participations in syndications of loans and lines of credit and purchase loans on a whole-loan basis.
Description of Divisions
Commercial Finance provides a range of commercial lending and deposit products, as well as ancillary services, including cash management and advisory services, primarily to small and middle market companies. Loans offered are primarily senior secured loans collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, transportation equipment (shipping vessels 
3 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017

and aircraft) and/or intangibles that are often used for working capital, plant expansion, acquisitions or recapitalizations. These loans include revolving lines of credit and term loans and, depending on the nature and quality of the collateral, may be referred to as asset-based loans or cash flow loans. Loans are originated through relationships with private equity sponsors, or through direct relationships, led by originators with significant experience in their respective industries. We partner in joint ventures and provide asset management services for which we collect management fees. We provide financing, treasury management and capital markets products to customers in a wide range of industries, including aerospace & defense, aviation, communication, energy, entertainment, gaming, healthcare, industrials, maritime, restaurants, retail, services and technology.
Rail offers customized leasing and financing solutions and a highly efficient fleet of railcars and locomotives to railroads and shippers throughout North America and Europe. We serve over 650 customers, including all of the U.S. and Canadian Class I railroads (i.e., railroads with annual revenues of at least USD $450 million), other railroads and non-rail companies, such as shippers and power and energy companies. Our owned operating lease fleet consists of approximately 132,000 railcars, of which approximately 14,800 are subject to a definitive sale agreement to sell our European rail business. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second half of 2018. 
Railcar types include covered hopper cars used to ship grain and agricultural products, plastic pellets, sand, and cement; tank cars for energy products and chemicals; gondolas for coal, steel coil and mill service products; open hopper cars for coal and aggregates; boxcars for paper and auto parts, and centerbeams and flat cars for lumber. The rail portfolio is discussed further in the Concentrations section of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Real Estate Finance provides senior secured commercial real estate loans to developers and other commercial real estate professionals. We focus on properties with a stable cash flow, provide financing to reposition existing properties, and originate construction loans to highly experienced and well capitalized developers. The division also includes a portfolio of acquired multi-family commercial mortgage loans that is being run off.
Business Capital provides leasing and equipment financing to small businesses and middle market companies in a wide range of industries on both a private label and direct basis. In our direct financing and leasing business, we provide financing solutions for our borrowers and lessees. Additionally, through our digital small business lending platform in Direct Capital, we provide small business unsecured loans and equipment financing. In our private label business, we assist manufacturers and distributors in growing sales, profitability and customer loyalty by providing customized, value-added finance solutions to their commercial clients. Our lending platform allows small businesses to access commercial loans and leases, including both capital and operating leases, through a highly automated credit approval, documentation and funding process. In addition, we provide factoring, receivable management, and secured financing to businesses (our clients, who are generally manufacturers or importers of goods) that operate in several industries, including apparel, textile, furniture, home furnishings and consumer electronics. Factoring entails the assumption of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable arising from the sale of goods by our clients to their customers (generally retailers) that have been factored (i.e., sold or assigned to the factor). Although primarily U.S.-based, we also conduct business with international clients and their customers.
Key Risks
Key risks faced by the divisions are credit, business and asset risk. Credit risks associated with secured financings relate to the ability of our borrower to repay our loan and the value of the collateral underlying the loan should our borrower default on its obligations.
Business risks relate to the demand for services that is broadly affected by the overall level of economic growth and is more specifically affected by the overall level of economic activity in CIT's target industries. If demand for CIT's products and services declines, then overall new business activity may decline. Likewise, changes in supply and demand of CIT's products and services also affect the pricing CIT can earn in the market. Additionally, new business volume in Commercial Banking is influenced by CIT's ability to maintain and develop relationships with its equity sponsors, clients, vendor partners, distributors and resellers. With regard to pricing, the divisions are subject to potential threats from competitor activity, which could negatively affect CIT's margins. Commercial Banking is also exposed to business risk related to its syndication activity. Under adverse market circumstances, CIT would be exposed to risk arising from the inability to sell loans to other lenders, resulting in lower fee income and higher than expected credit exposure to certain borrowers.
The products and services provided by Commercial Services (a unit of Business Capital that provides commercial factoring services) involve two types of credit risk: customer and client. A client is the counterparty to any factoring, financing, or receivables purchasing agreement that has been entered into with Commercial Services. A customer is the account debtor and obligor on trade accounts receivable that have been factored with and assigned to the factor.
The most prevalent risk in factoring transactions for Commercial Services is customer credit risk. Customer credit risk relates to the inability of a customer to pay undisputed factored trade accounts receivable. While less significant than customer credit exposure, there is also client credit risk in providing cash advances to factoring clients. Client credit risk relates to a decline in the creditworthiness of a borrowing client, their inability to repay their loan and the possible insufficiency of the underlying collateral (including the aforementioned customer accounts receivable) to cover any loan repayment shortfall. At December 31, 2017, client credit risk accounted for less than 10% of total Commercial Services credit exposure while customer credit risk accounted for the remainder.
Commercial Services is also subject to a variety of business risks including operational risk, due to the high volume of transactions, as well as business risks related to competitive pressures from other banks, boutique factors, and credit insurers and seasonal risks due to retail trends. These pressures create risk of reduced pricing and factoring volume for CIT. In addition, client de-factoring can occur if retail credit conditions are benign for a long period and clients no longer require factoring services for credit protection.
The primary risks for Rail are asset risk (resulting from ownership of the railcars and related equipment on operating lease) and credit risk. Asset risk arises from fluctuations in supply and demand for the underlying rail equipment that is leased. Rail invests in long-lived equipment, railcars/locomotives, which have economic useful lives of approximately 40-50 years. This equipment is then leased to commercial end-users with lease terms of approximately three to five years. CIT is exposed to the risk that, at the 
CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017 4

end of the lease term, the value of the asset will be lower than expected, resulting in reduced future lease income over the remaining life of the asset or a lower sale value.
Asset risk is generally recognized through changes to lease income streams from fluctuations in lease rates and/or utilization. Changes to lease income occur when the existing lease contract expires, the asset comes off lease, and the business seeks to enter a new lease agreement. Asset risk may also change depreciation, resulting from changes in the residual value of the operating lease asset or through impairment of the asset carrying value, which can occur at any time during the life of the asset. Asset risk is primarily related to the Rail division, and to a lesser extent, Business Capital.
Credit risk in the leased equipment portfolio results from the potential default of lessees, possibly driven by obligor specific or industry-wide conditions, and is economically less significant than asset risk for Rail, because in the operating lease business there is no extension of credit to the obligor. Instead, the lessor deploys a portion of the useful life of the asset. Credit losses manifest through multiple parts of the income statement including loss of lease/rental income due to missed payments, time off lease, or lower rental payments than the existing contract due to either a restructuring with the existing obligor or re-leasing of the asset to another obligor, as well as higher expenses due to, for example, repossession costs to recover, refurbish, and re-lease assets.
See "Concentrations" section of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 21 — Commitments of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of our rail portfolio.
CONSUMER BANKING
Consumer Banking includes Retail Banking, Consumer Lending, and SBA Lending, which are grouped together for purposes of discussion as Other Consumer Banking, and LCM. We source our consumer lending business primarily through our branch network, industry referrals, as well as direct digital marketing efforts. Periodically we purchase loans on a whole-loan basis.
Other Consumer Banking offers consumer mortgage lending and deposit products to its consumer customers. The division offers conforming and jumbo residential mortgage loans, primarily in Southern California. Mortgage loans are primarily originated through CIT Bank branch and retail referrals, employee referrals, internet leads and direct marketing. Additionally, loans are purchased through whole loan and portfolio acquisitions. Consumer Lending includes product specialists, internal sales support and origination processing, structuring and closing. Retail banking is the primary deposit gathering business of CIT Bank and operates through a network of 70 retail branches in Southern California and an online direct channel. We offer a broad range of deposit and lending products along with payment solutions to meet the needs of our clients (both individuals and small businesses), including checking, savings, money market, individual retirement accounts, and certificates of deposit.
The Other Consumer Banking division also originates qualified SBA 504 loans and 7(a) loans. SBA 504 loans generally provide growing small businesses with long-term, fixed-rate financing for major fixed assets, such as land and buildings. SBA 7(a) loans generally provide for purchase/refinance of owner occupied commercial real estate, working capital, acquisition of inventory, machinery, equipment, furniture, and fixtures, the refinance of outstanding debt subject to any program guidelines, and acquisition of businesses, including partnership buyouts. 
LCM includes portfolios of single family residential mortgages and reverse mortgages, certain of which are covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that expire between March 2019 and February 2020. Covered Loans in this segment were previously acquired by OneWest Bank, N.A. in connection with the FDIC-assisted lndyMac, FSB, First Federal and La Jolla transactions. The FDIC indemnified OneWest Bank, N.A. against certain future losses sustained on these loans. During the third quarter of 2017, CIT transferred the reverse mortgage loan portfolio to held for sale due to management’s decision to sell the portfolio, which is serviced by Financial Freedom.
Key Risks
Key risks faced are credit, collateral and geographic concentration risk. Similar to our commercial business, credit risks associated with secured consumer financings relate to the ability of the borrower to repay its loan and the value of the collateral underlying the loan should the borrower default on its obligations. Our consumer mortgage loans are typically collateralized by the underlying property, primarily single family homes. Therefore, collateral risk relates to the potential decline in value of the property securing the loan. Most of the loans are concentrated in Southern California. Therefore, the related geographic concentration risk relates to a potential downturn in the economic conditions or a potential natural disaster, such as earthquake or wildfire, in that region. As discussed in Note 5 — Indemnification Assets of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, certain indemnifications from the FDIC begin to expire in 2019.
NON-STRATEGIC PORTFOLIOS
NSP includes businesses and portfolios that we no longer consider strategic. The remaining loans at December 31, 2017, were in China and reported in assets held for sale.
CORPORATE AND OTHER
Certain items are not allocated to operating segments and are included in Corporate and Other. Some of the more significant and recurring items include interest income on investment securities, a portion of interest expense primarily related to corporate liquidity costs (interest expense), mark-to-market adjustments on non-qualifying derivatives (other non-interest income), restructuring charges for severance and facilities exit activities as well as certain unallocated costs (operating expenses), certain intangible assets amortization expenses (other expenses) and loss on debt extinguishments.
CIT BANK, N.A.
CIT Bank is regulated by the OCC.
CIT Bank raises deposits through its 70 branch network in Southern California, and from retail and institutional customers through commercial channels, its online bank (www.bankoncit.com) and, to a lesser extent, broker channels. CIT Bank's existing suite of deposit products includes checking, savings, money market, individual retirement accounts and certificates of deposit.
CIT Bank provides lending, leasing and other financial and advisory services, primarily to small and middle-market companies across select industries through its Commercial Finance, Rail, Real Estate Finance, and Business Capital divisions. The Bank also offers residential mortgage lending and deposits to its customers through its Other Consumer Banking division.
CIT Bank's loans and leases are primarily commercial loans, consumer loans and operating lease equipment. CIT Bank's operating lease portfolio consists primarily of leased railcars and related equipment.
At year-end, CIT Bank remained well capitalized, maintaining capital ratios well above required levels.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Discontinued operations at December 31, 2017 was comprised of Business Air and Financial Freedom, our reverse mortgage servicing business. In April 2017, we sold Commercial Air and in October 2017, we announced an agreement to sell Financial Freedom. Discontinued operations are discussed, along with balance sheet and income statement items, in Note 2 — Discontinued Operations in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. See also Note 22 — Contingencies for discussion related to the servicing business.
Key Risks
Key risks faced by the discontinued operations are credit risk (Business Air) and operational risk for Financial Freedom.
Credit risk associated with Business Air loans relates to the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and the Company's ability to realize the value of the collateral underlying the loan should a borrower default on its obligations.
Item 1:  Business Overview

5 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017

The mortgage servicing business operates in a highly regulated environment, and is thus subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), and various state agencies that license, audit and conduct examinations of our mortgage servicing, and collection activities.
To the extent that we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations or licensing requirements and taking into account any ongoing investigations, there could be additional charges to the financial statements in future periods.
EMPLOYEES
CIT employed 4,167 people at December 31, 2017, which included 258 employees in our discontinued operations. Based upon the location of the Company's legal entities, as of December 31, 2017, 4,055 were employed in U.S. entities and 112 in non-U.S. entities.
COMPETITION
We operate in competitive markets. Our competitors include global and domestic commercial banks, regional and community banks, captive finance companies, leasing companies, business development companies, and other non-bank lenders. In most of our business segments, we have a few large competitors that have significant market share and many smaller niche competitors. Many of our competitors have substantial financial, technological, and marketing resources.
Our customer value proposition is primarily based on financing terms, structuring solutions, and client service. From time to time, due to highly competitive markets, we may (i) lose market share if we are unwilling to match product structure, pricing, or terms of our competitors that do not meet our credit standards or return requirements or (ii) receive lower returns or incur higher credit losses if we match our competitors’ product structure, pricing, or terms. Our funding structure puts us at a competitive disadvantage to other commercial banks due to our higher cost of funds, but we continue to shift our funding to lower-cost sources, such as deposits. We tend not to compete on price, but rather on industry experience, asset and equipment knowledge, and customer service. 
REGULATION
We are regulated by U.S. federal banking laws, regulations and policies. Such laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers and the federal Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), as well as to minimize risk to the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our shareholders or non-depository creditors. Bank regulatory agencies have broad examination and enforcement power over bank holding companies (“BHCs”) and their subsidiaries, including the power to impose substantial fines, limit dividends and other capital distributions, restrict operations and acquisitions, and require divestitures. BHCs and banks, as well as subsidiaries of both, are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound. CIT is a BHC, and elected to become a FHC. CIT Bank is chartered as a national bank by the OCC and is a member bank of the FRB. CIT and CIT Bank are subject to certain limitations on our activities, transactions with affiliates, and payment of dividends, and certain standards for capital and liquidity, safety and soundness, and incentive compensation, among other matters. The principal regulator of CIT and its non-bank subsidiaries is the FRB and the principal regulator of CIT Bank and its subsidiaries is the OCC. Both CIT and CIT Bank are subject to the jurisdiction of the CFPB.
Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of other domestic and foreign governmental agencies. CIT Capital Securities LLC is a broker-dealer licensed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), and is subject to the jurisdiction of FINRA and the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). CIT also holds a 15% interest in CIT Group Securities (Canada) Inc., which is licensed and subject to the jurisdiction of the Ontario Securities Commission. Our insurance operations are primarily conducted through The Equipment Insurance Company and CIT Insurance Agency, Inc. Each company is licensed to enter into insurance contracts and is subject to regulation and examination by insurance regulators. In connection with the disposition of our international platforms, we have surrendered all of our banking licenses outside of the United States.
In 2015, we exceeded the $50 billion threshold that subjects BHCs to enhanced prudential supervision requirements under Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and regulations issued by the FRB thereunder. Although our assets fell below $50 billion at September 30, 2017, we will continue to be subject to these regulations unless our assets remain below $50 billion for four consecutive quarters, at least through June 30, 2018. We expect to continue devoting significant additional resources in terms of both increased expenditures and management time in 2018 to complete the implementation of each of these requirements and ongoing costs thereafter to continue to comply with these enhanced prudential supervision requirements. See “Enhanced Prudential Standards for Large Bank Holding Companies” below.
The OCC approved the OneWest Transaction subject to two conditions. First, the OCC required CIT Bank to submit a comprehensive business plan covering a period of at least three years, including a financial forecast, a capital plan that provides for maintenance of CIT Bank’s capital, a funding plan and a contingency funding plan, the intended types and volumes of lending activities, and an action plan to accomplish identified strategic goals and objectives. The Bank must report quarterly to the OCC and explain any material variances. The Board must review the performance of CIT Bank under the business plan at least annually and CIT Bank must update the business plan annually.
Second, the OCC required CIT Bank to submit a revised Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) Plan after the merger, describing the actions it intended to take to help meet the credit needs in low and moderate income (“LMI”) areas within its assessment areas, the management structure responsible for implementing the CRA Plan, and the Board committee responsible for overseeing the Bank’s performance under the CRA Plan. In addition, CIT Bank is required to publish on its public website (i) a 
CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017 6

copy of its revised CRA Plan and (ii) a CRA Plan summary report that demonstrates the measurable results of the revised CRA Plan a month prior to the commencement of CIT Bank’s performance evaluation.
The FRB Order approved the OneWest Transaction subject to CIT committing to meet certain levels of CRA-reportable lending and CRA Qualified Investments in its assessment areas over 4 years, making annual donations to qualified non-profit organizations that provide services in its assessment areas, locating 15% of its branches and ATMs in LMI census tracts, and providing 2,100 hours of CRA volunteer service.
CIT Bank filed its CRA Plan with the OCC in December 2015 and its comprehensive business plan in March 2016. We filed updated business plans with the OCC in December 2016. The CRA Plan and the comprehensive business plan were each subject to review and received a non-objection by the OCC.
Banking Supervision and Regulation
Permissible Activities
The BHC Act limits the business of BHCs that are not FHCs to banking, managing or controlling banks, performing servicing activities for subsidiaries, and engaging in activities that the FRB has determined, by order or regulation, are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. An FHC also may engage in, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in, activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature as long as the FHC continues to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs, including that the FHC and each of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed.”
A depository institution subsidiary is considered “well-capitalized” if it satisfies the requirements discussed below under “Prompt Corrective Action.” A depository institution subsidiary is considered “well-managed” if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination. If an FHC ceases to be well-capitalized and well-managed, the FHC must enter into a non-public confidential agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the FHC returns to compliance, the FRB may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any new non-banking financial activities permissible for FHCs or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the FRB. If the company does not timely return to compliance, the FRB may require divestiture of the FHCs depository institutions. BHCs and banks must also be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state. An FHC will also be limited in its ability to commence non-banking financial activities or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities if any of its insured depository institution subsidiaries fails to maintain a “satisfactory” rating under the CRA, as described below under “Community Reinvestment Act.”
Activities that are “financial in nature” include securities underwriting, dealing and market making, advising mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency, merchant banking, and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. “Complementary activities” are activities that the FRB determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness issue. CIT is primarily engaged in activities that are permissible for a BHC, rather than the expanded activities available to an FHC.
Volcker Rule
The Dodd-Frank Act limits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in or sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (e.g., hedge funds and private equity funds). This statutory provision is commonly called the “Volcker Rule”. Under the final rules adopted by the federal banking agencies, the SEC, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), banking entities are required to implement an extensive compliance program, including an enhanced compliance program applicable to banking entities with more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets. The FRB extended the conformance period for CIT through July 2022 for investments in and relationships with so-called legacy covered funds. The Volcker Rule has not had a material effect on CIT’s business and activities, as we have a limited amount of trading activities and fund investments. CIT has sold most of its private equity fund investments, but may incur additional costs to dispose of its remaining fund investments, which have a remaining book value of approximately $1.9 million. 
Capital Requirements
In July 2013, the FRB, OCC, and FDIC issued a final rule (the “Basel III Final Rule”) establishing risk-based capital guidelines that are based upon the final framework for strengthening capital and liquidity regulation (“Basel III”) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”). The Company, as well as the Bank, became subject to the Basel III Final Rule, applying the Standardized Approach, effective January 1, 2015. Prior to January 1, 2015, the risk-based capital guidelines applicable to CIT were based upon the 1988 Capital Accord (“Basel I”) of the Basel Committee.
The Basel III Final Rule retained the previous capital components of Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital, and Total capital (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) and their related regulatory capital ratios, subject to certain changes, and introduced a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”) and a related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets. The Basel III Final Rule also (i) specifies that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (ii) mandates that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iii) expands the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to previous regulations. The most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital instruments is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital instruments is subordinated notes, which are subject to the Basel III Final Rule specific requirements. The Company has non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock outstanding, but not subordinated notes.
The Basel III Final Rule provides for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, goodwill, other intangible assets, and deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards net of any related valuation allowance. Also, mortgage servicing rights, DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial institutions must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, 
Item 1:  Business Overview

7 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017

exceed 15% of CET1. The non-DTA related deductions (goodwill, intangibles, etc.) may be reduced by netting with any associated deferred tax liabilities (“DTLs”). As for the DTA deductions, the netting of any remaining DTL must be allocated in proportion to the DTAs arising from net operating losses and tax credit carry-forward and those arising from temporary differences.
In addition, under the Basel III Final Rule, the effects of certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) included in shareholders’ equity (for example, mark-to-market of securities held in the available-for-sale (“AFS”) portfolio) under U.S. GAAP are not excluded in determining regulatory capital ratios; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including the Company and CIT Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude the AOCI items excluded under Basel I. Both the Company and CIT Bank have elected to exclude AOCI items from regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Final Rule also prohibits including certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, in Tier 1 capital. The Company did not have any hybrid securities outstanding at December 31, 2017.
Under the Basel III Final Rule, assets and certain off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are converted into risk-weighted assets against which regulatory capital is measured. The Basel III Final Rule expanded the risk-weighting categories for BHCs and banks that follow the Standardized approach from the previous four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the exposure, ranging from 0% for U.S. government securities, to as high as 1,250% for such exposures as credit-enhancing interest-only strips or unsettled security/commodity transactions.
Per the Basel III Final Rule, the minimum capital ratios for CET1, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital are 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%. The Basel III Final Rule introduces a new “capital conservation buffer”, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. This buffer was implemented beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625%, and will increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Under the previous Basel I capital guidelines, the Company and CIT Bank were required to maintain Tier 1 and Total capital equal to at least 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively, of total risk-weighted assets to be considered “adequately capitalized”, or 6.0% and 10.0%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized.”
CIT will be required to maintain risk-based capital ratios at January 1, 2019 as follows:

 | Minimum Capital Requirements — January 1, 2019
 | CET 1 | | Tier 1Capital | | TotalCapital | 
Stated minimum ratios | 4.5 | % | 6.0 | % | 8.0 | %
Capital conservation buffer (fully phased-in) | 2.5 | % | 2.5 | % | 2.5 | %
Effective minimum ratios (fully phased-in) | 7.0 | % | 8.5 | % | 10.5 | %
Effective minimum ratios (as of January 1, 2018) | 6.375 | % | 7.875 | % | 9.875 | %

As non-advanced approaches banking organizations, the Company and CIT Bank are not subject to the Basel III Final Rule's countercyclical buffer or the supplementary leverage ratio.
The Company and CIT Bank meet all capital requirements under the Basel III Final Rule, including the capital conservation buffer, on a fully phased in basis as if such requirements were currently effective. The table in Part 2 Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Regulatory Capital section) presents CIT's and CIT Bank's capital ratios as of December 31, 2017, calculated under the fully phased-in Basel III Final Rule — Standardized approach.
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV”). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee's standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain "unconditionally cancellable commitments," such as unused credit card and home equity lines of credit) and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company or CIT Bank. The impact of Basel IV on the Company and CIT Bank will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators.
Enhanced Prudential Standards for Large Bank Holding Companies
Under Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has promulgated regulations imposing enhanced prudential supervision requirements on BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. CIT continues to be subject to certain of these requirements, including (i) capital planning and company-run and supervisory stress testing requirements, under the FRB’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) process, (ii) enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements, (iii) company-run liquidity stress testing and the requirement to hold a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for various time horizons, including 30, 60, and 90 days, (iv) the modified liquidity coverage ratio, which requires that we hold a sufficient level of high quality liquid assets to meet our projected net cash outflows over a 30 day stress horizon, (v) recovery and resolution planning (also referred to as the “Living Will”), and (vi) enhanced reporting requirements. We expect to incur ongoing costs to comply with these enhanced prudential supervision requirements.
Stress Test and Capital Plan Requirements
CIT is subject to capital planning and stress testing requirements as applicable under the FRB’s Regulation Y and Regulation YY, which requires BHCs with greater than $50 billion of total consolidated assets to submit an annual capital plan and demonstrate that they can meet required capital levels over a nine quarter planning horizon, after taking into account the impact of stresses 
CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017 8

based on both supervisory and company-specific scenarios. Beginning with the 2017 CCAR cycle, the FRB no longer evaluates capital plans submitted by BHCs that have total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion but less than $250 billion and nonbank assets of less than $75 billion (referred to as “large and noncomplex firms”), such as CIT, based on qualitative criteria, although the FRB may still object to capital plans submitted by large and noncomplex firms on the basis of quantitative criteria. In 2017, the FRB replaced the CCAR qualitative assessment of large and noncomplex firms with a separate, horizontal review of specific areas of capital planning to assess the strength of each firm’s capital planning processes, referred to as the Horizontal Capital Review, which is conducted as part of the normal supervisory process. Each of the BHCs participating in the CCAR process is also required to collect and report certain related data to the FRB on a quarterly basis to allow the FRB to monitor progress against the approved capital plans.
In addition to other limitations, our ability to make any capital distribution (including dividends and share repurchases) is contingent upon the FRB’s non-objection of our capital plan. Should the FRB object to a capital plan, a BHC may not make any capital distributions other than those capital distributions which the FRB has indicated its non-objection in writing. The results of our quantitative CCAR review are made public by the FRB each year in accordance with their CCAR schedule.
The enhanced prudential standards under the Dodd-Frank Act also require CIT and CIT Bank to conduct enterprise-wide stress tests (“DFAST”) to assess the impact of stress scenarios on their consolidated earnings, losses, and capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon, taking into account their current and forecasted financial condition, risks, exposures, strategies, and activities. CIT Bank is required to conduct an annual stress test and CIT must conduct both an annual and a mid-cycle stress test. 
Liquidity Requirements
The Basel III final framework requires banks and BHCs to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. 
On September 3, 2014, the banking regulators adopted a joint final rule implementing a comprehensive version of the LCR to large and internationally active U.S. banking organizations, which include banks with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more or total consolidated on-balance sheet foreign exposure of $10 billion or more, or any depository institution with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more that is a consolidated subsidiary of either of the foregoing. These institutions are required to hold high-quality, liquid assets, such as central bank reserves and government and corporate debt that can be converted easily and quickly into cash, in an amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash outflows minus its projected cash inflows capped at 75% of projected cash outflows for a 30-day stress period. The firms must calculate their LCR each business day.
The final rule applies a modified version of the LCR requirements to bank holding companies such as CIT with total consolidated assets of greater than $50 billion but less than $250 billion. The modified version of the LCR requirement only requires the LCR calculation to be performed on the last business day of each month and sets the denominator (that is, the calculation of net cash outflows) for the modified version at 70% of the denominator as calculated under the most comprehensive version of the rule applicable to larger institutions. As of December 31, 2017, CIT’s LCR was above the minimum requirement as of that date. In December 2016, the FRB issued a final rule that requires BHCs, such as CIT, to disclose publicly, on a quarterly basis, quantitative and qualitative information about certain components of its LCR, beginning on October 1, 2018 for BHCs subject to the modified version of the LCR requirement.
In May 2016, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies issued a proposed rule that would implement the NSFR test called for by the Basel III final framework for large U.S. banking organizations. Under the proposed rule, CIT would be subject to a modified NSFR standard which would require it to maintain a NSFR of 0.7 on an ongoing basis, calculated by dividing its available stable funding (“ASF”) by its required stable funding (“RSF”). Under the proposed rule, a banking organization’s ASF would be calculated by applying standard weightings to its equity and liabilities based on their expected stability over a one-year period and its RSF would be calculated by applying specified standardized weightings to its assets, derivative exposures and commitments based on their liquidity characteristics over the same one-year period. The effective date of the proposed rule has not been determined. We currently expect that the proposed rule will not have a material impact on our liquidity needs.
In addition to the LCR and NSFR, the final rules issued by the FRB setting forth enhanced prudential supervision requirements under Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act also require BHCs with total consolidated assets of greater than $50 billion but less than $250 billion, to conduct company-run liquidity stress testing, hold a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected stressed funding needs for various time horizons and comply with enhanced reporting requirements (such as collateral and intraday liquidity monitoring). 
Resolution Planning
BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are required to report periodically to regulators a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. Such a resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that its depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from its other subsidiaries. The final rule sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a detailed resolution strategy, a description of the range of specific actions the company proposes to take in resolution, and an analysis of the company's organizational structure, material entities, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. CIT submitted its initial resolution plan in December 2016. In August 2017, CIT received a one-year extension on the submission of its next resolution plan, which is now due by December 31, 2018.
Orderly Liquidation Authority
The Dodd-Frank Act created the Orderly Liquidation Authority ("OLA"), a resolution regime for systemically important non-bank financial companies, including BHCs and their non-bank affiliates, under which the FDIC may be appointed receiver to liquidate such a company upon a determination by the Secretary of the Treasury (Treasury), after consultation with the President, with support by a supermajority recommendation from the FRB and, depending on the type of entity, the approval of the director of 
Item 1:  Business Overview

9 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017

the Federal Insurance Office, a supermajority vote of the SEC, or a supermajority vote of the FDIC, that the company is in danger of default, that such default presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability, and that the company should be subject to the OLA process. This resolution authority is similar to the FDIC resolution model for depository institutions, with certain modifications to reflect differences between depository institutions and non-bank financial companies and to reduce disparities between the treatment of creditors' claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and in an orderly liquidation authority proceeding compared to those that would exist under the resolution model for insured depository institutions.
An Orderly Liquidation Fund will fund OLA liquidation proceedings through borrowings from the Treasury and risk-based assessments made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, any non-bank financial company supervised by the FRB, and certain other financial companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. If an orderly liquidation is triggered, CIT could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund. We do not yet have an indication of the level of such assessments. Furthermore, were CIT to become subject to the OLA, the regime may also require changes to CIT's structure, organization and funding pursuant to the guidelines described above.
Prompt Corrective Action
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, as amended (“FDICIA”), among other things, establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The Basel III Final Rule revised the prompt corrective action regulations by adding a CET1 ratio at each capital category (except critically undercapitalized) and increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for each capital category. The following table sets forth the required capital ratios to be deemed “well capitalized” or “adequately capitalized” under regulations in effect at December 31, 2017.

 | Prompt Corrective Action Ratios — December 31, 2017
 | WellCapitalized(1) | | AdequatelyCapitalized | 
CET 1 | 6.5 | % | 4.5 | %
Tier 1 Capital | 8.0 | % | 6.0 | %
Total Capital | 10.0 | % | 8.0 | %
Tier 1 Leverage(2) | 5.0 | % | 4.0 | %
(1) A "well capitalized" institution also must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
(2) As a standardized approach banking organization, CIT Bank is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which becomes effective January 1, 2018. 

CIT Bank's capital ratios were all in excess of minimum guidelines for well capitalized at December 31, 2017. Neither CIT nor CIT Bank is subject to any order or written agreement regarding any capital requirements.
FDICIA requires the applicable federal regulatory authorities to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum requirements. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions as the capital category of an institution declines. Undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized depository institutions are required to submit a capital restoration plan to their primary federal regulator. Although prompt corrective action regulations apply only to depository institutions and not to BHCs, the holding company must guarantee any such capital restoration plan in certain circumstances. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the bank’s assets at the time it became “undercapitalized” or the amount needed to comply. The parent holding company might also be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill that guarantee. In the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, such guarantee would take priority over the parent’s general unsecured creditors.
Regulators take into consideration both risk-based capital ratios and other factors that can affect a bank's financial condition, including (a) concentrations of credit risk, (b) interest rate risk, and (c) risks from non-traditional activities, along with an institution's ability to manage those risks, when determining capital adequacy. This evaluation is made during the institution's safety and soundness examination. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters.
Acquisitions
Federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving depository institutions or BHCs. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for (1) the acquisition by a BHC of direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of a bank, savings association, or BHC, (2) the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings association by any subsidiary of a BHC other than a bank, or (3) the merger or consolidation of any BHC with another BHC. Prior regulatory approval is also generally required for mergers, acquisitions and consolidations involving other insured depository institutions. In reviewing acquisition and merger applications, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect of the transaction, financial and managerial issues, including the capital position of the combined organization, convenience and needs factors, including the applicant's CRA record, the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities, and the transaction's effect on the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. In addition, a FHC must obtain prior approval of the FRB before acquiring certain non-bank financial companies with assets exceeding $10 billion.
CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017 10

Dividends
CIT Group Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from CIT Bank and CIT’s other subsidiaries. Most of CIT’s cash inflow is comprised of interest on intercompany loans to its subsidiaries and dividends from its subsidiaries.
We are limited to paying dividends and repurchasing stock in accordance with our capital plan annually submitted to the FRB under the capital plan rule. The ability of CIT to pay dividends on common stock may be affected by, among other things, various capital requirements, particularly the capital and non-capital standards established for depository institutions under FDICIA, which may limit the ability of CIT Bank to pay dividends to CIT. The right of CIT, its stockholders, and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its subsidiaries is further subject to prior claims of creditors of CIT Bank and CIT’s other subsidiaries.
OCC regulations limit dividends if the total amount of all dividends (common and preferred) declared in any current year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the total net income for the current year to date plus any retained net income for the prior two years, less the sum of any transfers required by the OCC and any transfers required to fund the retirement of any preferred stock. If the dividend in either of the prior two years exceeded that year’s net income, the excess shall not reduce the net income for the three year period described above, provided the amount of excess dividends for either of the prior two years can be offset by retained net income in the current year minus three years or the current year minus four years.
It is the policy of the FRB that a BHC generally pay dividends on common stock out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year, only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition, and only if the BHC is not in danger of failing to meet its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. In the current financial and economic environment, the FRB indicated that BHCs should not maintain high dividend pay-out ratios unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. A BHC should not maintain a dividend level that places undue pressure on the capital of bank subsidiaries, or that may undermine the BHC’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank.
Source of Strength Doctrine and Support for Subsidiary Banks
FRB policy and federal statute require BHCs such as CIT to serve as a source of strength and to commit capital and other financial resources to subsidiary banks. This support may be required at times when CIT may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations. If CIT is unable to provide such support, the FRB could instead require the divestiture of CIT Bank and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture. Any capital loans by a BHC to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. If a BHC commits to a federal bank regulator that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRB's invoking its source of strength authority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment.
Enforcement Powers of Federal Banking Agencies
The FRB and other U.S. banking agencies have broad enforcement powers with respect to an insured depository institution and its holding company, including the power to (i) impose cease and desist orders, substantial fines and other civil penalties, (ii) terminate deposit insurance, and (iii) appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject CIT or CIT Bank, as well as their officers and directors, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties.
FDIC Deposit Insurance
Deposits of CIT Bank are insured by the DIF up to $250,000 for each depositor. The DIF is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions, including CIT Bank.
The FDIC uses a two scorecard system, one scorecard for most large institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, such as CIT Bank, and another scorecard for "highly complex" institutions with over $50 billion in assets that are directly or indirectly controlled by a U.S. parent with over $500 billion in assets. Each scorecard has a performance score and a loss-severity score that is combined to produce a total score, which is translated into an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC utilizes a bank's capital level and CAMELS ratings (a composite regulatory rating based on Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to market risk) and certain financial measures designed to assess an institution's ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC also has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score, up or down based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard. The total score translates to an initial base assessment rate on a non-linear, sharply increasing scale. As of July 1, 2016, for large institutions, the initial base assessment rate ranges from three to thirty basis points (0.03% – 0.30%) on an annualized basis. After the effect of potential base rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from one and a half to forty basis points (0.015% – 0.40%) on an annualized basis.
In March 2016, the FDIC adopted a final rule increasing the reserve ratio for the DIF to 1.35% of total insured deposits. The rule imposed a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, such as CIT Bank, beginning the third quarter of 2016 and continuing through the earlier of the quarter that the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35% or December 31, 2018. The FDIC will, at least semi-annually, update its income and loss projections for the DIF and, if necessary, propose rules to further increase assessment rates. Also, an institution must pay an additional premium (the depository institution debt adjustment) equal to fifty basis points (0.50%) on every dollar above 3% of an institution's Tier 1 capital of long-term, unsecured debt held that was issued by another insured depository institution (excluding debt guaranteed under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program). For the year ended December 31, 2017, CIT Bank's FDIC deposit insurance assessment, including risk-based premium assessments, totaled $69 million.
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDIA"), the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
Item 1:  Business Overview

11 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Transactions with Affiliates
Transactions between CIT Bank and its subsidiaries, and CIT and its other subsidiaries and affiliates, are regulated pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB's Regulation W. These laws and regulations limit the types and amounts of transactions (including loans due and credit extensions from CIT Bank or its subsidiaries to CIT and its other subsidiaries and affiliates) as well as restrict certain other transactions (such as the purchase of existing loans or other assets by CIT Bank or its subsidiaries from CIT and its other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may otherwise take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arms-length basis and, in the case of extensions of credit, be secured by specified amounts and types of collateral. These regulations generally do not apply to transactions between CIT Bank and its subsidiaries.
A revolving credit facility that was originally issued to a customer and financed by CIT, was refinanced during 2017 by CIT Bank, and had an outstanding balance of $9 million at December 31, 2017. 
During 2017, CIT Bank invested in an asset-based-lending joint venture and holds a 20% equity investment. CIT Asset Management LLC, a non-bank subsidiary of CIT, acts as an investment advisor and servicer of the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2017 CIT Bank’s investment was $5 million, with the expectation of additional investment as the joint venture grows. Management fees are earned by CIT Asset Management LLC on loans under management. CIT Bank maintains sufficient collateral in the form of cash deposits and pledged loans to cover any extensions of credit to its affiliates. 
The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization and changed the procedure for seeking exemptions from these restrictions. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the definition of a “covered transaction” to include derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions with a non-bank affiliate under which a bank (or its subsidiary) has credit exposure. Collateral requirements will apply to such transactions as well as to certain repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.
Safety and Soundness Standards
FDICIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe safety and soundness standards, by regulations or guidelines, as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. See “Prompt Corrective Action” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties.
Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution
If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the power:

• | to transfer any of the depository institution's assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution's creditors;


• | to enforce the terms of the depository institution's contracts pursuant to their terms; or


• | to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution.

In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of deposit liabilities, including the claims of the FDIC as the guarantor of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution, including claims of debt holders of the institution, in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever seeks to repudiate any debt obligations of CIT Bank, the debt holders would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than CIT Bank's depositors.
Consumer Protection Regulation
Retail banking activities are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by national banks are subject to federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to numerous laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:

• | the federal Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;


• | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;

CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017 12


• | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, governing the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies;


• | the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by debt collectors;


• | the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, applying to all debts incurred prior to commencement of active military service (including credit card and other open-end debt) and limiting the amount of interest, including service and renewal charges and any other fees or charges (other than bona fide insurance) that is related to the obligation or liability, as well as affording other protections, including with respect to foreclosures; and


• | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, requiring disclosures regarding the nature and costs of the real estate settlement process and governing transfers of servicing, escrow accounts, force-placed insurance, and general servicing policies; and


• | the guidance of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such laws.

Deposit operations also are subject to consumer protection laws and regulation, such as:

• | the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which require disclosure of deposit terms to consumers;


• | Regulation CC, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers;


• | the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and


• | the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, which governs electronic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customer' rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services, including remittance transfers.

CIT and CIT Bank are also subject to certain other non-preempted state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers. Additionally, CIT Bank is subject to a variety of regulatory and contractual obligations imposed by credit owners, insurers and guarantors of the mortgages we originate and service. This includes, but is not limited to, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the Federal Housing Finance Agency ("FHFA"), and the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"). We are also subject to the requirements of the Home Affordable Modification Program ("HAMP"), Home Affordable Refinance Program ("HARP") and other government programs in which we participate.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision ("CFPB")
The CFPB is authorized to interpret and administer, and to issue orders or guidelines pursuant to, any federal consumer financial laws, as well as to directly examine and enforce compliance with those laws by depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, such as CIT Bank. The CFPB has jurisdiction over CIT, CIT Bank, and other subsidiaries with respect to matters that relate to these laws and consumer financial services and products and periodically conducts examinations. 
The CFPB has adopted a number of significant rules that require banks to, among other things: (a) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new “ability to repay” requirement and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage”; (b) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including, but not limited to, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence; and (c) comply with additional rules and restrictions regarding mortgage loan originator compensation and the qualification and registration or licensing of loan originators.
The CFPB and other federal agencies have also jointly finalized rules imposing credit risk retention requirements on lenders originating certain mortgage loans, which require sponsors of a securitization to retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk of assets collateralizing asset-backed securities. Residential mortgage-backed securities qualifying as "qualified residential mortgages" will be exempt from the risk retention requirements. The final rule maintains revisions to the proposed rules that cover degrees of flexibility for meeting risk retention requirements and the relationship between "qualified mortgages" and "qualified residential mortgages." These rules and any other new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB could require changes to the Company's mortgage origination and servicing businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the streams of revenue of such businesses.
Over the last few years, the reverse mortgage business has been subject to substantial amendments to federal laws, regulations and administrative guidance. HUD, through the FHA, amended or clarified both origination and servicing requirements related to Home Equity Conversion Mortgages ("HECMs") through a series of issuances during 2015 and 2014. These program changes related to advertising, restrictions on loan provisions, limitations on payment methods, new underwriting requirements, revised principal limits, revised financial assessment and property charge requirements, and the treatment of non-borrowing spouses.
Community Reinvestment Act
The CRA requires depository institutions like CIT Bank to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice by, among other things, providing credit to low-and moderate-income individuals and communities. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for depository institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings, which are made available to the public. In order for a FHC to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the FHC 
Item 1:  Business Overview

13 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017

must have received a rating of at least "satisfactory" in its most recent examination under the CRA. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of applications to acquire, merge, or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company, to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an office, and such record may be the basis for denying the application. CIT Bank received a rating of "Satisfactory" on its most recent CRA examination by the OCC.
Incentive Compensation
In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued comprehensive final guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization's ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act discussed below.
During the second quarter of 2016, the federal banking agencies and the SEC proposed rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including CIT and CIT Bank). The proposed rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities, additional specific requirements for entities with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion, and further, more stringent requirements for those with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion. The general qualitative requirements include (i) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation; (ii) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss; (iii) establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward; (iv) requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements; and (v) mandating appropriate record-keeping. For larger financial institutions, including CIT, the proposed rules would also introduce additional requirements applicable only to “senior executive officers” and “significant risk-takers” (as defined in the proposed rules), including (i) limits on performance measures and leverage relating to performance targets; (ii) minimum deferral periods; and (iii) subjecting incentive compensation to possible downward adjustment, forfeiture and clawback. If the rules are adopted in the form proposed, they may restrict CIT’s flexibility with respect to the manner in which it structures compensation for its executives.
Anti-Money Laundering ("AML") and Economic Sanctions
In the U.S., the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as amended, imposes significant obligations on financial institutions, including banks, to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing, including requirements to implement AML programs, verify the identity of customers that maintain accounts, file currency transaction reports, and monitor and report suspicious activity to appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities. Anti-money laundering laws outside the U.S. contain similar requirements to implement AML programs. The Company has implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable AML laws and regulations. The Company has also implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), which administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the U.S., as well as sanctions based on United Nations and other international mandates.
Anti-corruption
The Company is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. The Company is also subject to applicable anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions in which it may do business, which often prohibit commercial bribery, the receipt of a bribe, and the failure to prevent bribery by an associated person, in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials. The Company has implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws, rules, and regulations.
Privacy Provisions and Customer and Client Information
Certain aspects of the Company’s business are subject to legal requirements concerning the use and protection of customer information, including those adopted pursuant to Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 in the U.S., and various laws in other jurisdictions in which it may do business. Federal banking regulators, as required under the GLBA, have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties, requiring disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allowing consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. Federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period, after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers, before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of cross-selling products and services between those affiliated companies. 
Other Regulations
In addition to U.S. banking regulation, our operations are subject to supervision and regulation by other federal, state, and various foreign governmental authorities. Additionally, our operations may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions. This oversight may serve to:
•regulate credit granting activities, including establishing licensing requirements, if any, in various jurisdictions;
•establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges;
CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017 14

•regulate customers' insurance coverages;
•require disclosures to customers;
•govern secured transactions;
•set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices;
•prohibit discrimination in the extension of credit and administration of loans; and
•regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower's credit experience and other data collection.
Our Aerospace, Rail, Maritime, and other equipment financing operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. In the U.S., our equipment financing and leasing operations, including for aircraft, railcars, ships, and other equipment, are subject to rules and regulations relating to safety, operations, maintenance, and mechanical standards promulgated by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Association of American Railroads, the Maritime Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, state agencies regulate some aspects of rail and maritime operations with respect to health and safety matters not otherwise preempted by federal law.
Each of CIT's insurance subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in the states in which it conducts insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the financial aspects and business conduct of insurers. State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: licensing companies and agents to transact business; establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and the solvency standards that must be met and maintained; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; approving changes in control of insurance companies; restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. Each insurance subsidiary is required to file reports, generally including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which it does business, and its operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by such authorities.
Changes to laws of states and countries in which we do business could affect the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. We cannot accurately predict whether such changes will occur or, if they occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon our financial condition or results of operations.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Accretable Yield reflects the excess of cash flows expected to be collected (estimated fair value at acquisition date) over the recorded investment of Purchase Credit Impaired ("PCI") Loans and Investments and is recognized in interest income using an effective yield method over the expected remaining life. The accretable yield is affected by changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans, changes in prepayment assumptions and changes in expected principal and interest payments and collateral values.
Assets Held for Sale ("AHFS") include loans and operating lease equipment that we no longer have the intent or ability to hold until maturity. As applicable, AHFS would also include a component of goodwill associated with portfolios or businesses held for sale.
Available-for-sale ("AFS") is a classification that pertains to debt and equity securities. We classify these securities as AFS when they are not considered trading securities, securities carried at fair value, or held-to-maturity securities. AFS securities are included in investment securities in the balance sheet.
Average Earning Assets ("AEA") is computed using month end balances and is the average of Earning Assets. We use this average for certain key profitability ratios, including return on AEA, Net Finance Revenue as a percentage of AEA (Net Finance Margin or "NFM") and operating expenses as a percentage of AEA for the respective period.
Item 1:  Business Overview

15 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017

Average Loans is computed using month end balances and does not include amounts held for sale. We use this average to measure the rate of net charge-offs for the respective period.
Average Operating Leases ("AOL") is computed using month end balances and is the average of operating lease equipment, which does not include amounts held for sale. We use this average to measure the rate of return on our operating lease portfolio for the respective period.
Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1"), Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital are regulatory capital measures as defined in the capital adequacy guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve. CET1 is common stockholders' equity reduced by capital deductions such as goodwill, intangible assets and DTAs that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards, and adjusted by elements of other comprehensive income and other items. Tier 1 Capital is Common Tier 1 Capital plus other additional Tier 1 Capital instruments including, among other things, non-cumulative preferred stock. Total Capital consists of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital, which includes for CIT qualifying allowance for credit losses and other reserves.
Covered Loans are loans that CIT may be reimbursed for a portion of future losses under the terms of Loss Sharing Agreements with the FDIC. See Indemnification Assets.
Delinquent Loan categorization occurs when payment is not received when contractually due. Delinquent loan trends are used as a gauge of potential portfolio degradation or improvement.
Derivative Contract is a contract whose value is derived from a specified asset or an index, such as an interest rate or a foreign currency exchange rate. As the value of that asset or index changes, so does the value of the derivative contract. We use derivatives to manage interest rate, foreign currency or credit risks. The derivative contracts we use may include interest-rate swaps, interest rate caps, cross-currency swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, and credit default swaps.
Earning Assets is the sum of loans (defined below) less the credit balances of factoring clients, operating lease equipment, net, AHFS, interest-bearing cash, investment securities and securities purchased under agreements to resell, all as of a specific date.
Economic Value of Equity ("EVE") measures the net impact of hypothetical changes in the value of equity by assessing the economic value of assets, liabilities and derivatives.
FICO Score is a credit bureau-based industry standard score developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation (currently named FICO) that predicts the likelihood of borrower default. We use FICO scores in underwriting and assessing risk in our consumer lending portfolio.
Gross Yield is calculated as finance revenue divided by AEA and derives the revenue yield generated over the respective period.
Indemnification Assets relate to asset purchases completed by OneWest Bank, in which the FDIC indemnified OneWest Bank prior to its acquisition by CIT against certain future losses in accordance with the Loss Sharing Agreements, as defined below. 
Interest income includes interest earned on loans, interest-bearing cash balances, debt investments and dividends on investments.
Lease — capital is an agreement in which the party who owns the property (lessor), which is CIT as part of our finance business, permits another party (lessee), which is our customer, to use the property with substantially all of the economic benefits and risks of asset ownership passed to the lessee.
Lease — operating is a lease in which CIT retains ownership of the asset (operating lease equipment, net), collects rental payments, recognizes depreciation on the asset, and retains the risks of ownership, including obsolescence.
Loans include loans, capital lease receivables, factoring receivables and rent receivable on operating lease equipment, and does not include amounts contained within AHFS. 
Loans and Leases include Loans, operating lease equipment, net, and AHFS, all measured as of a specific date.
Loan-to-Value Ratio ("LTV") is a calculation of a loan's collateral coverage that is used in underwriting and assessing risk in our lending portfolio. LTV at any point in time is the result of the total loan obligations secured by collateral divided by the fair value of the collateral.
Loss Sharing Agreements are agreements in which the FDIC indemnifies OneWest Bank against certain future losses. See Indemnification Assets defined above. The loss sharing agreements generally require CIT, through its acquisition of OneWest Bank, to obtain FDIC approval prior to transferring or selling loans and related indemnification assets. Eligible losses are submitted to the FDIC for reimbursement when a qualifying loss event occurs (e.g., charge-off of loan balance or liquidation of collateral). Reimbursements approved by the FDIC usually are received within 60 days of submission. Receivables related to these indemnification assets are referred to as Covered Loans.
Lower of Cost or Fair Value relates to the carrying value of an asset. The cost refers to the current book balance of certain assets, such as held for sale assets, and if that balance is higher than the fair value, an impairment charge is reflected in the current period statement of income.
Net Efficiency Ratio is a non-GAAP measure that measures the level of operating expenses to our revenue generation over a period of time. It is calculated by dividing operating expenses, excluding intangible assets amortization, goodwill impairment, and restructuring charges, by Total Net Revenue. This calculation may differ from to other financial institutions' ratio due to the inclusion of operating lease revenue and associated expenses, and the exclusion of the noted items.
Net Finance Revenue ("NFR") is a non-GAAP measurement defined as Net Interest Revenue (defined below) plus net operating lease revenue (rental income on operating lease equipment less depreciation on operating lease equipment and maintenance 
CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017 16

and other operating lease expenses). When divided by AEA, the product is defined as Net Finance Margin ("NFM"). NFM is a non-GAAP measurement. These are key measures used by management in the evaluation of the financial performance of our business. Since average operating lease equipment was 16% of AEA for the year ended December 31, 2017, NFM is a more appropriate metric for CIT than net interest margin ("NIM") (a common metric used by other BHCs defined as interest income less interest expense), as NIM does not fully reflect the earnings of our portfolio because it includes the impact of debt costs on all our assets but excludes the net revenue (rental income less depreciation and maintenance and other operating lease expenses) from operating lease equipment.
Net Interest Income Sensitivity ("NII Sensitivity") measures the net impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on forecasted net interest revenue and rental income from specific items, assuming a static balance sheet over a twelve-month period.
Net Interest Revenue reflects interest and fees on loans, interest on interest-bearing cash, and interest/dividends on investments less interest expense on deposits and borrowings.
Net Operating Loss Carryforward / Carryback ("NOLs") is a tax concept, whereby tax losses in one year can be used to offset taxable income in other years. For example, U.S. Federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning  before January 1, 2018 can first be carried-back and applied against taxable income recorded in the two preceding years with any remaining amount being carried-forward for the next twenty years to offset future taxable income.  For U.S. Federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning January 1, 2018, the utilization of these NOLs is limited to 80% of taxable income. Further, these NOLs may not be carried-back but may be carried forward indefinitely.  The rules pertaining to the number of years allowed for the carryback or carryforward of an NOL varies by jurisdiction.  
New business volume represents the initial cash outlay related to new loan or lease equipment transactions entered into during the period. The amount includes CIT's portion of a syndicated transaction, whether it acts as the agent or a participant, and in certain instances, it includes asset purchases from third parties.
Non-accrual Loans include loans greater than or equal to $500,000 that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired, as well as loans less than $500,000 that are delinquent (generally for 90 days or more), unless it is both well secured and in the process of collection. Non-accrual loans also include loans with revenue recognition on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower.
Non-performing Assets include Non-accrual Loans combined with OREO (defined below) and repossessed assets.
Other Non-Interest Income includes (1) fee revenues, including fees on lines of credit, letters of credit, capital market related fees, agent and advisory fees and servicing fees, (2) factoring commissions (3) gains and losses on asset sales, including leasing equipment, loans and loan portfolios, investment securities, and OREO, (4) net gains and losses on derivatives and foreign currency exchange, (5) impairment on assets, and (6) other revenues. 
Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO") is a term applied to real estate property owned by a financial institution. OREO are considered non-performing assets.
Purchase Accounting Adjustments ("PAA") reflect accretable and non-accretable components of the fair value adjustments to acquired assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Accretable adjustments reflect discounts and premiums to the acquired assets and liabilities. The accretion or amortization of the discounts and premiums are recognized in the income statement (interest income, interest expense, non-interest income and operating expenses) over the weighted average life for pool level and contractual for loan level of the assets or liabilities. The accretable adjustments are recognized using an applicable methodology, such as the effective interest method. These primarily relate to interest adjustments on loans, as well as deposits and borrowings. The PAA for the intangible assets is amortized over the respective life of the underlying intangible asset and recorded in Operating expenses. Non-accretable adjustments, for instance credit related write-downs on loans, become adjustments to the basis of the asset and flow back through the statement of income only upon the occurrence of certain events, such as, but not limited to repayment or sale.
Purchase Credit Impaired ("PCI") Loans and PCI Investments are loans and investments that at the time of an acquisition are considered impaired. These are determined to be impaired as there was evidence of credit deterioration since origination of the loan and investment and for which it was probable that all contractually due amounts (principal and interest) would not be collected.
Regulatory Credit Classifications used by CIT are as follows:

• | Pass — These assets do not meet the criteria for classification in one of the following categories;


• | Special Mention — These assets exhibit potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention and if left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects;


• | Substandard — These assets are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower, and are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the deficiencies are not corrected;


• | Doubtful — These assets have weaknesses that make collection in full unlikely, based on current facts, conditions, and values; and


• | Loss — These assets are considered uncollectible and of little or no value and are generally charged off.

Classified assets are rated as substandard, doubtful or loss and range from: (1) assets that exhibit a well-defined weakness and are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower, and are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the deficiencies are not corrected to (2) assets with weaknesses that make 
Item 1:  Business Overview

17 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2017

collection in full unlikely on the basis of current facts, conditions, and values. Assets in this classification can be accruing or on non-accrual depending on the evaluation of these factors. Classified loans plus special mention loans are considered criticized loans.
Residual Values represent the estimated value of equipment at the end of its lease term. For operating lease equipment, it is the value to which the asset is depreciated at the end of its estimated useful life.
Risk Weighted Assets ("RWA") is the denominator to which CET1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital is compared to derive the respective risk based regulatory ratios. RWA is comprised of both on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet items (for example loan commitments, purchase commitments or derivative contracts). RWA items are adjusted by certain risk-weightings as defined by the regulators, which are based upon, among other things, the relative credit risk of the counterparty.
Syndication and Sale of Receivables result from originating loans with the intent to sell a portion, or the entire balance, of these assets to other institutions. We earn and recognize fees and/or gains on sales, which are reflected in other non-interest income, for acting as arranger or agent in these transactions.
Tangible Book Value ("TBV") excludes goodwill and intangible assets from common stockholders' equity. We use TBV in measuring tangible book value per common share as of a specific date.
Total Net Revenue is a non-GAAP measurement and is the sum of NFR and other non-interest income.
Total Return Swap ("TRS") is a swap where one party agrees to pay the other the "total return" of a defined underlying asset (e.g., a loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of LIBOR-based cash flows. The total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. The counterparty is therefore assuming the risks and rewards of the underlying asset.
Troubled Debt Restructuring ("TDR") occurs when a lender, for economic or legal reasons, grants a concession to the borrower related to the borrower's financial difficulties that it would not otherwise consider.
Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets. These entities: lack sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; have equity owners who either do not have voting rights or lack the ability to make significant decisions affecting the entity's operations; and/or have equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb the entity's losses or the right to receive the entity's returns.
Yield-related Fees are collected in connection with our assumption of underwriting risk in certain transactions in addition to interest income. We recognize yield-related fees, which include prepayment fees and certain origination fees, in interest income over the life of the lending transaction.
