Item 1.          Business
Company Overview
 
We develop and sell computer software that provides secure information exchange, data transfer and sharing capabilities for enterprises and consumers. We have been in business for more than twenty years having sold our products to thousands of enterprises and more than one million individual consumers globally.
 
Our primary business is selling and supporting managed file transfer, or MFT, software for enterprises. MFT software facilitates the transfer of data from one location to another across a computer network within a single enterprise or between multiple computer networks in multiple enterprises.
 
Our MFT products are based upon our Enhanced File Transfer, or EFT, platform. This platform emphasizes secure and efficient data exchange for virtually any organization. It enables business partners, customers and employees to share information safely and securely. The EFT platform provides enterprise-level security while automating the integration of back-end systems which are features often missing from traditional file transfer software. The EFT platform features built-in regulatory compliance, governance, and visibility controls to maintain data safety and security. It can replace legacy systems, homegrown servers, expensive leased lines and virtual area networks, all of which can be insecure, with a top-performing, scalable alternative. The EFT platform promotes ease of administration while providing the detailed capabilities necessary for complete control of a file transfer system.
 
We earn most of our revenue from the sale of products and services that are part of our EFT platform. Our customers can purchase the capabilities of our EFT platform in two ways:
 
 
· | Under a perpetual software license for which they pay a one-time fee and under which they typically install our product on computers that they own and/or manage. Our brand name for this product is EFT. Almost all customers who purchase EFT also purchase a maintenance and support, or M&S, contract for which they pay us an annual recurring fee. Most of the revenue we have earned from our EFT platform products has been from sales of perpetual software licenses and related M&S.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, under which they pay us ongoing fees to access the capabilities of the EFT platform in the cloud. Through the end of 2017, EFT Cloud was our SaaS offering of the EFT platform which users accessed for a flat monthly subscription fee. In January 2018, we introduced EFT Arcus, which will be our SaaS offering of the EFT platform going forward, for which users will pay a base monthly subscription fee plus an additional variable amount determined based upon their metered usage of EFT Arcus resources.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We sell other products that are synergistic to our EFT platform including Mail Express, WAFS, and CuteFTP. Collectively, these products constituted less than 5% of our total revenue in 2017. Customers pay a one-time fee to purchase these products under a perpetual software license. Some customers also purchase an M&S contract. We do not offer a SaaS version of these products and have no plans to do so.
 
We also earn revenue from professional services we provide to assist our customers in configuring and integrating our EFT platform products into their environments.
 
We focus on selling our EFT platform products in a business-to-business environment. The majority of the resources we will expend in the future for product research, development, marketing and sales will focus on our EFT platform products. We expect to expend minimal resources developing and selling our other products. We believe our EFT platform products and business capabilities are well-positioned to compete effectively in the market for these products.
 
In June 2017, we introduced a data integration product that we planned to sell under the brand name Kenetix. We licensed the technology for this product from a third party. This product is a cloud-based, integration-as-a-service, or iPaaS, solution used to connect applications, microservices, application program interfaces (or API’s), data and processes within and between organizations. We have experienced issues with the third-party technology and have determined to suspend marketing of the product as we evaluate options and determine whether the licensor can effectively address the issues.

GlobalSCAPE was incorporated in Delaware in 1996.  Our address is 4500 Lockhill-Selma Road, Suite 150, San Antonio, Texas 78249. Our phone number is (210) 308-8267.
 
Industry Background
 
Communication across private and public computer networks that facilitates the movement and sharing of information between central and remote locations and with associates, employees, partners, suppliers, and customers is an integral part of daily operations for enterprises of all sizes. Corporate information managers must protect business assets, ensure that policies and processes meet regulations governing the management of sensitive information, and ensure that the right people have access to the right information, at the right place and at the right time. Global operations, diverse business partners and networks further emphasize the need for software applications that ensure compatibility, scalability, privacy, and security. These requirements have created the need for maintaining the security of data and information in motion (for example, with traditional MFT solutions delivered as on-premises software or as a cloud service) and at rest (for example, through securely deleting or purging files or securely accessing stored data from mobile tablet or smartphone devices).
  
The increase in high-profile and large scale data breaches in corporate enterprises and government agencies involving access to information in an unauthorized manner have created a heightened awareness of the vulnerability of critical and confidential data. As a result, attention at an unprecedented level is being paid to the security and integrity of systems that store and transfer data electronically. In many cases, this emphasis involves assessing the adequacy of the security, reliability and visibility provided by existing MFT systems.
 
The need for secure MFT solutions is particularly strong for organizations faced with a daunting array of privacy, security, and remote accessibility challenges stemming from various regulatory and business requirements for data privacy and confidentiality. Regulatory requirements regarding privacy and security include federal legislation and regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Federal Trade Commission Red Flags Rules, as well as state legislation and regulations in the U.S., such as California Senate Bill (SB) 1386 and the data security regulations issued by the Massachusetts Office of Consumer Affairs and Business. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also places requirements on organizations who will have a need for our solutions. Some of these statutes and regulations impose severe penalties for improper disclosure of confidential information.  In addition to legal obligations, industry best-practices such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and self-imposed business requirements lead to the need to secure and protect consumer information, intellectual property and trade secrets. Use of secure MFT solutions offers protection against disclosure of proprietary information and also reduces corporate risks associated with the potentially devastating consequences of security breaches.
 
Our primary industry is known as managed file transfer. The MFT industry has its technical origin in the file transfer protocol, or FTP.  FTP dates back to 1980 (RFC 765, later superseded by RFC 959), with even earlier RFCs guiding prior attempts to establish standards for file transfer protocols. The use of file transfer protocols increased dramatically with the explosive growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web during the 1990s. The MFT industry arose from recognition that FTP alone does not provide adequate security and management capabilities for file transfers. MFT solutions offer a greater degree of security and control than FTP. Features available in MFT solutions include integrated security, auditing capabilities, performance monitoring, and reporting. The MFT industry includes low cost, or even free, solutions that offer basic capabilities. However, we believe businesses and even individuals require more advanced solutions that provide scalability, enhanced security options, automated workflow, dedicated maintenance and support, and other features that facilitate high-confidence, secure and cost effective file transfers.

Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned, released, and scaled to meet requirements.  We believe the continuing movement to cloud services is analogous to the telecommunications shift from dedicated point-to-point circuits to a delivery model in which the entire telecommunications infrastructure potentially can be used to establish, maintain, and manage individual connections on an as-needed basis.
 
Strategy
 
Our long-standing vision has been to simply and securely automate the flow of information between people, places and systems. Using that vision as a foundation, in 2018 we introduced a fundamentally new brand identity, logo and narrative that embodies our plan to evolve to being primarily a cloud software and services provider.  EFT Arcus is the foundation of that evolution. In addition, we adopted a new visual identity built upon a new tagline: “Make Business Flow Brilliantly”. Our visual theme now features a shifting background wave of colors representing the perpetual flow of data both within and between enterprises using our technology as a conduit through which the flow of business and the data it creates can be managed, monitored, controlled and viewed in a secure manner.
 
We intend to build upon our leadership position in the MFT market to provide businesses, other organizations, and individual users with the solutions necessary to meet their growing need for secure information exchange. We believe fully addressing this need for secure information exchange requires consideration of capabilities beyond traditional MFT, including the sharing of content between both people and businesses, work group collaboration, access to content outside the data center, business-to-business partner enablement, electronic data interchange, integration between systems and information, solution-wide governance, and advanced visibility including analytics, dashboards, and transaction-level control.
 
Going forward, we intend to focus on determining which areas of our business will contribute to our future growth in their current state, need additional investment to contribute in the desired manner or require further analysis to determine their place in our product offerings.  As we evolve our solution portfolio, we intend to maintain an appropriate balance between legacy and new solutions, including making choices about transitioning, sustaining, or retiring solutions as necessary to best operate under prevailing business conditions. Transitioning or sustaining solutions may involve consolidating capabilities within our solution portfolio, releasing upgrades in response to market or customer needs, or making bug fixes. We also may phase out solutions and earlier versions of our solutions periodically in accordance with our end-of-life, or EOL, policy.
 
In addition to expanding our products into areas adjacent to MFT, we also believe that we need to continue to expand the means of delivering our MFT products.  To that end, we intend to continue expanding our capability to deliver our EFT platform through our EFT Arcus SaaS delivery model which provides a flexible continuum of features and functions that provide the user the ability to pick and choose the extent to which they want to own or outsource the capabilities of our EFT platform. EFT Arcus also provides organizations the flexibility of deploying on-premises, in the cloud or in a hybrid cloud environment with all of the security, compliance, scalability, and visibility features of an on-premises managed file transfer solution. We seek to evolve our strategic focus based on our vision for product innovation and development, our assessment of visibility of and demand for our products in the marketplace, and our evaluation of desired approaches for selling and delivering our products.  Our strategic focus consists of: 

 
· | Ongoing innovation of our EFT platform to address the expanding needs of our existing customers and to enhance our products’ appeal to new customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Licensing, developing and/or acquiring technologies with features and functions that are complementary to and synergistic with our EFT platform so as to expand the breadth of our product offerings.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhancing our sales and marketing programs to improve identification of potential demand for our products and to increase the rate at which we are successful in selling our products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ongoing Innovation of Our EFT Platform to Address the Expanding Needs of Our Existing Customers and to Enhance Our Products’ Appeal to New Customers.
 
We seek to continue to improve and enhance our core technology, primarily in the MFT space, in both breadth and depth.  By focusing on the breadth of the product, we seek to pursue different segments of the market to ensure that we have products and services that meet the needs of small and medium businesses, or SMBs, but also scale to meet the demands of larger enterprises.  This will require new features and packages to be released to these audiences.  We believe that increasing the depth of our products by adding new features will allow us to increase sales to new customers as well as our existing client base by helping them solve additional problems within their organizations.
 

7
 


We believe customers in the markets we serve will increasingly begin assessing the viability of accessing and using MFT capabilities through cloud-based, SaaS offerings. Consistent with our new branding initiative, we intend to emphasize the development, marketing and sales of products with features and capabilities that support our customers accessing them through a SaaS offering hosted in the cloud such as EFT Arcus.
 
Licensing, Developing and/or Acquiring Technologies With Features and Functions that are Complementary to and Synergistic with Our EFT Platform so as to Expand the Breadth of Our Product Offerings.
 
The second area of strategic focus continues with product innovation but extends beyond pure MFT into adjacent segments and technologies such as data movement and data security.  We intend to continue to focus on determining which areas of our business will contribute to our future growth in their current state, need additional investment to contribute in the desired manner, or require further analysis to determine their future strategy.
 
Our solution portfolio may evolve over time, for example, through development of new offerings in adjacent markets or through acquisitions of technologies by licensing, partnering or by acquiring companies which own such technologies. We also maintain an active research and development program and work closely with partners and others in the industry to identify new solution opportunities. We also intend to remain alert for attractive opportunities to collaborate with others or perhaps combine other revenue-producing technologies with ours to expand our product offerings and reach.
 
We have allocated significant resources in recent years to enhancing our existing products and developing new solutions. This strategic focus has resulted in our adding features and functions to our EFT platform products and enhancing our ability to deliver those products to our customers in a variety of ways ranging from an on-premise, perpetual license to a full SaaS offering.
 
As we evolve our solution portfolio, we intend to maintain an appropriate balance between legacy and new solutions, including making choices about transitioning, sustaining, or retiring solutions as necessary to best operate under prevailing business conditions. Transitioning or sustaining solutions may involve consolidating capabilities within our solution portfolio, releasing upgrades in response to market or customer needs, making bug fixes, or phasing-out solutions periodically pursuant to our EOL policy.
 
Enhancing Our Sales and Marketing Programs to Improve Identification of Potential Demand for Our Products and to Increase the Rate at Which We are Successful in Selling Our Products.
 
We intend to sustain a high level of execution of our demand generation activities through our marketing group to provide a continuing flow of sales leads to our direct sales personnel and our channel sales partners.  During 2018, our sales and marketing efforts will continue to focus on enabling our channel partners and engaging their customers and prospects. We intend to continue to enhance our partner program to reward our partners who participate in our sales and technical certifications and drive new opportunities for us.  We believe that our marketing, sales and channel demand generation programs will continue to be a primary growth driver for the foreseeable future.
 
We also intend to continue to emphasize ongoing initiatives to elevate our product and corporate profiles and awareness under the GlobalSCAPE, EFT, and EFT Arcus brands. We believe that the transformation of our product lines into a more comprehensive solution architecture will continue to elevate this brand awareness with larger enterprises while still serving the needs of our traditional clients.  We intend to use internal resources as well as outside marketing and communications professionals to support this work.
 
We conduct business with thousands of organizations around the world. We provide solutions to some of the world’s largest manufacturers, distributors, banks, insurance companies, healthcare providers, automakers, film companies and technology providers. Given the breadth and depth of these market opportunities, we believe the effectiveness of a direct sales approach using only our in-house personnel to sell our products is limited by the number of qualified sales people we can hire and the number of prospective clients to whom they can present our products.  As a result, we plan to continue emphasizing expanding our third-party sales channel relationships.
 

8
 


We believe that utilizing and expanding our third-party sales channel relationships allow us to leverage the existing base of sales people in place in those companies and their existing customer relationships. In addition to exposing our products to hundreds, and potentially thousands, of sales people employed by those third-party resellers, our products can benefit from proven sales programs and methodologies in those organizations that are financed and supported by those selling partners.  We believe operating an aggressive channel reseller program provides an opportunity for our products to be presented to a notably larger number of potential buyers and in a more rapid fashion than if we attempted the same effort using only our direct salespersons.  We will continue to expand and enhance our existing channel relationships while at the same time identifying and engaging additional channel partners. Using this approach, we believe we can maintain and expand the exposure for our products in the marketplace in a manner that would probably take several years for us to accomplish on our own.
 
We believe this channel sales program helps us establish and maintain a lower-touch delivery model through which we train these partners to sell and distribute our solutions and provide them sales and marketing tools to support that effort. We utilize this approach to reduce our overall cost of marketing and selling our solutions in areas where it would be costly to establish a presence with our own employees.
 
Software Products and Services
 
We develop and sell computer software that provides secure information exchange, data transfer, and data sharing capabilities for enterprises and consumers. We have been in business for more than twenty years having sold our products to thousands of enterprises and more than one million individual consumers globally.
 
Our primary business is selling and supporting MFT software for enterprises. MFT software facilitates the transfer of data from one location to another across a computer network within a single enterprise or between multiple computer networks in multiple enterprises. These transfers may be ongoing, repetitive activities executed by automated software routines that occur without human intervention, or they may be transfers that people create and complete in the absence of automated routines or as a result of ad-hoc, special situations that arise from time-to-time. Examples of enterprise-level activities that rely on MFT software include:
 
 
· | Transfer of transactional information within an enterprise on a repetitive basis from one geographic location to another, such as a transfer of deposit and withdrawal information throughout the day from a branch of a bank to a central data processing center at another location.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Movement of accumulated information within an enterprise from one data processing application to another on a periodic basis, such as a transfer of bi-weekly payroll information from a payroll system that is used to pay employees to a job cost system that is used to manage the cost of a project.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exchange of information between enterprises to facilitate the completion of one or more business transactions, such as a retailer transmitting inventory purchasing requirements produced by its material requirements planning system to an order entry system at a supplying vendor.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We earn over 90% of our revenue from the sale of MFT products and services that are part of our EFT platform. We have multiple revenue streams from the EFT platform that include:
 
 
· | Perpetual software licenses under which customers pay us a one-time fee for the right to install our products in their information systems environment on computers they manage and either own or otherwise procure from a cloud services provider, including deploying our products at a cloud services provider in a bring-your-own-license, or BYOL, environment. Our brand name for this product is EFT. Historically, most of the revenue we have earned from our EFT platform products has been from sales of EFT perpetual software licenses and related M&S.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cloud-based, SaaS solutions that we sell on an ongoing subscription basis. Through the end of 2017, EFT Cloud was our SaaS offering of the EFT platform which users accessed for a flat monthly subscription fee. In January 2018, we introduced EFT Arcus, our SaaS offering of the EFT platform going forward, for which users will pay a base monthly subscription fee plus an additional variable amount based upon their metered usage of EFT Arcus resources.

We focus on selling our EFT platform products in a business-to-business environment. The majority of the resources we will expend in the future for product research, development, marketing and sales will focus on this product line. We expect to expend minimal resources developing and selling our other products. We believe our EFT platform products and business capabilities are well-positioned to compete effectively in the market for these products. For a more comprehensive discussion of the products we sell and the services we offer, see below.
 
We earn less than 5% of our revenue from selling other products that can be synergistic to our EFT platform. These products have capabilities that:
 
 
· | Support information sharing and exchange capabilities using traditional email systems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enable enterprise file synchronization and sharing.
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | Enhance the ability to replicate, share and backup files within a wide area network or local area network, thereby allowing users to access their data at higher speeds than possible with most alternate approaches.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Support file transfers by individuals and small businesses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------



We earn most of our revenue from the sale of our EFT platform products that support business-to-business activities and are strategically focused on selling products in that environment. We intend to expend the majority of our resources in the future for product research and development, marketing, and sales in a manner that concentrates on the business-to-business market. We believe our products and business capabilities are well-positioned to compete effectively in that market.
 
Some of our products support consumer-oriented file transfers and file sharing. Even though these products are profitable on an overall basis, we anticipate the future resources we will expend related to products sold to consumers and the associated revenue we earn from those products will continue to be a minor part of our business.
 
Our long-standing vision has been to simply and securely automate the flow of information between people, places and applications. Using that vision as a foundation, in 2018 we introduced a fundamentally new brand identity, logo and narrative that embodies our plan to evolve to being primarily a cloud software and services provider.  EFT Arcus is the foundation of that evolution. In addition, we adopted a new visual identity built upon a new tagline: “Make Business Flow Brilliantly”. Our visual theme now features a shifting background wave of colors representing the perpetual flow of data both within and between enterprises using our technology as a conduit through which the flow of business and the data it creates can be managed, monitored, controlled and viewed in a secure manner.
 
The following discussion presents a summary description of our specific products and solutions.
 
Managed File Transfer–EFT Platform
 
Enhanced File Transfer, or EFT, is the brand name of our core MFT product platform. Our EFT platform products received multiple industry awards in compliance categories in 2017 including the 2017 Golden Bridge awards, the Network Product Guide’s 2017 IT World Awards, and the 2017 Info Security Products Guide Global Excellence Awards.
 
The EFT platform provides users the ability to securely transmit data from one location to another using any number of files of any size or configuration. It facilitates management, monitoring, and reporting on file transfers and delivers advanced data transfer workflow capabilities to move data and information into, out of, and throughout an enterprise.
 
The EFT platform provides a common, scalable MFT environment that accommodates a broad family of accompanying modules to provide enterprises with increased security, automation, and performance when compared to traditional FTP-based and email delivery systems. Various optional modules allow users to select the solution configuration most applicable to their requirements for auditing and reporting, encryption, ad hoc and web-based file transfers, operability in or through a DMZ network, and integration with back-end business processes, including workflow automation capabilities.
 
General features and capabilities of the EFT platform include:
 
 
· | State-of-the-art, enterprise-level security when transferring information within or between computer networks as well as for collaboration with business partners, customers, and employees. EFT provides automation that supports effective integration of back-end systems. It has built-in regulatory compliance, governance, and visibility controls to provide a means of safely maintaining information. EFT offers a high level of performance and scalability to support operational efficiency and maintain business continuity. Administrative tools are provided at various levels of granularity to allow for complete control and monitoring of file transfer activities.

· | Transmission of critical information such as financial data, medical records, customer files, vendor files, personnel files, transaction activity, and other similar documents between diverse and geographically separated network infrastructures while supporting a range of information protection approaches to meet privacy and other security requirements. In addition to enabling the secure, flexible transmission of critical information using servers, desktop, and notebook computers and a wide range of network-enabled mobile devices, our products also provide customers with the ability to monitor and audit file transfer activities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Compliance with government regulations and industry standards relating to the protection of information while allowing users to reduce information systems and technologies costs, increase efficiency, track and audit transactions, and automate processes. Our solutions also provide data replication, acceleration of file transfer, sharing/collaboration, and continuous data backup and recovery.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Specific capabilities of the EFT platform that we currently highlight while marketing this product include:
 
 
· | Secure File Transfers – The EFT platform enables an organization to securely manage file transfers among worldwide offices, clients, and partners using industry-standard Internet protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SFTP, and AS2. It provides the flexibility needed to meet the specific requirements of vendors, business partners, and customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increased Efficiency of Information Technology Operations with File Transfer Automation - Automation allows data delivery without manual intervention thereby saving time and avoiding potential errors. The EFT platform streamlines business processes without limitations imposed by legacy systems and applications. Its automation capabilities set it apart from every other MFT solution on the market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transmission of Large Files over Large Distances with File Transfer Acceleration - High latency and bandwidth issues are often a major obstacle for organizations that need to transfer large files over great distances. Without solutions for these issues, organizations can fail to meet service level commitments, miss critical deadlines or be forced to travel with, or ship, hard copies of data. The EFT platform can increase the speed at which information is transmitted over large geographical distances.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved Uptime for Critical File Transfer Processes – The EFT platform can be deployed in an active-active, highly available cluster. The EFT platform is scalable so as to provide the flexibility to increase throughput or ensure non-stop uptime of business critical systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Integration with Popular Authentication Measures – The EFT platform provides support for easy-to-use authentication methods, including smart card, single sign-on, and multi-factor authentication options.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Meeting Compliance Mandates for MFT Systems – The EFT platform helps our customers achieve the highest levels of compliance with government and corporate security policies and privacy regulations, such as PCI DSS, FIPS 140-2, HIPAA, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a manner that can protect sensitive and mission-critical data.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



During 2017, we continued to improve the features and capabilities of the EFT platform and announced several product upgrades that included:
 
 
· | EFT Insight, a new reporting platform to strengthen data governance and provide near real-time visibility into business critical data flows and exchanges.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cloud storage support capabilities with the Remote Agent Module and Cloud Connector Module.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanded support for High Availability capabilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | New Workspaces features.
--+-------------------------


· | Enhanced Web Transfer Client user access to improve user experience.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved SFTP security setting configuration to enable more visibility into security settings and help administrators ensure compliance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | New automation and security features.
--+--------------------------------------



We expect to continue enhancing the EFT platform with capabilities that improve its speed and responsiveness of performance, provide additional administration flexibility supporting cross-platform implementation with our DMZ Gateway solution, offer more robust reporting capabilities, and provide additional language support.

EFT Platform – Delivery Offerings
 
Our customers can purchase the capabilities of our EFT platform in two ways:
 
 
· | Under a perpetual software license for which they pay a one-time fee and under which they typically install our product on computers that they own and/or manage. The EFT platform purchased in this manner can also be used in a bring-your-own-license environment hosted by major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. Almost all customers who purchase a perpetual license to use the EFT platform also purchase an M&S contract for which they pay us a recurring fee that is typically 20% to 30% of the perpetual license fee per year.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, under which the customer pays us monthly subscription and usage fees to access the capabilities of the EFT platform in the cloud. Our brand name for this product is EFT Arcus. We introduced this product in January 2018. We have not yet earned significant revenue from the SaaS offering of our EFT platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



EFT Arcus
 
While we currently earn most of our EFT platform revenue from sales of perpetual licenses combined with an M&S contract, we recognize that a major shift toward a SaaS environment is underway in the marketplace. For this reason, we are increasingly emphasizing the ongoing development, enhancement and marketing of EFT Arcus. Key features of EFT Arcus include:
 
 
· | Consumption-based pricing that allows customers to pay only for the capacity and throughput they use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No long-term contractual commitment.
--+-------------------------------------


· | Automatic scalability to accommodate varying workloads to mitigate concerns about capacity planning.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A single tenant environment that allows each customer to have a private deployment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On-the-fly upgrades.
--+---------------------


· | Data encrypted while at rest.
--+------------------------------


· | A minimum service level commitment of 99.9%.
--+---------------------------------------------



The features and functions of EFT Arcus are most similar to those of our EFT Enterprise product for which our customers can purchase a perpetual license for on-premise installation. With few exceptions, EFT Arcus offers the same features and functions as EFT Enterprise.
 
We host and deploy EFT Arcus on Microsoft Azure. It provides our customers with a global platform on which to use EFT Arcus and offers the infrastructure security, compliance and redundancy features required by many customers. Microsoft Azure provides our customers with geo-redundant storage which replicates data to a secondary region that is geographically distant from the primary region.
 
For the first 24 to 36 months that a customer subscribes to EFT Arcus, we believe that its cumulative cost of ownership will typically be less than its total cost of purchasing an EFT platform perpetual license combined with an M&S contract. Accordingly, we expect the revenue we earn during that period from an EFT Arcus customer will be less than the revenue we would earn from that same customer during that same period if it purchased a perpetual license with an M&S contract. However, we believe thereafter and over the long term, the cumulative, recurring revenue stream we will earn from an EFT Arcus customer will exceed what we would have otherwise earned from the sale of a perpetual license combined with an M&S contract.
 
Prior to the release of EFT Arcus, we delivered our EFT platform SaaS products under the EFT Cloud brand name. The primary difference between EFT Arcus and EFT Cloud is that EFT Arcus provides enhanced flexibility and scalability through a consumption-based billing model that allows customers to pay only for the capacity and through-put they use. EFT Cloud was based upon a flat-rate billing model. Legacy subscribers to our EFT Cloud service will be allowed to continue under that arrangement indefinitely while we introduce them to EFT Arcus.
 
Customers subscribing to EFT Arcus may deem that controls pertaining to EFT Arcus are relevant to their internal control over financial reporting. In that case, a customer may request us to provide them our management description of a service organization’s system and a service auditor’s report on that description and on the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls (commonly referred to as a SOC Type 1 or SOC Type 2 report prescribed under SSAE 18 issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants). Currently, we rely on our third-party service provider who hosts EFT Arcus for that report as it pertains to controls they have in place. We do not presently have this report in place with respect to controls that we design, implement and manage at GlobalSCAPE. We are currently assessing the work necessary to provide such a report. The absence of this report could cause certain potential customers to choose not to subscribe to EFT Arcus.

The revenue we earned from our EFT platform SaaS products was not a material part of our total revenue in 2017 and 2016.
 
EFT SMB and Enterprise
 
For customers who desire to purchase a perpetual license, we offer two product editions based on the EFT platform, EFT SMB and EFT Enterprise.
 
EFT SMB is the edition for small-to-medium businesses who need MFT capabilities with basic features and functions but still desire to take advantage of automated data exchange, military-proven security, and infrastructure stability. As the customer’s needs expand over time, it can purchase add-on modules as-needed to enhance the capabilities of its EFT SMB solution.
 
EFT Enterprise is suitable for organizations with complex and mission-critical file transfer requirements. This edition of the EFT platform provides access to additional capabilities including:
 
 
· | Business activity monitoring.
--+------------------------------


· | Content integrity control.
--+---------------------------


· | Advanced workflow to build automated actions.
--+----------------------------------------------


· | Advanced authentication.
--+-------------------------


· | Remote agent.
--+--------------


· | Cloud connectivity.
--+--------------------

Secure Information Sharing and Exchange Solution – Mail Express
 
Mail Express provides secure information sharing and exchange capabilities leveraging traditional email workflow. It is a stand-alone product installed in a client-server environment that allows users to send and receive secure, encrypted email and attachments of virtually unlimited size. Mail Express was a Bronze Winner in Email Security and Management by Network Products Guide’s 2016 IT World Awards.
 
To broaden the appeal and capabilities of Mail Express, we continue to develop and add functionality that integrates the features of Mail Express into the EFT platform through the Workspaces Outlook Plugin. This integration takes the superior control, visibility and monitoring capabilities of the EFT platform and makes them available to administrators and users in an email environment. The Workspaces Outlook Plugin combines the technology and features available in Mail Express with the functionality of Workspaces and integrates them directly into EFT Enterprise.
 
We will continue to offer Mail Express as a stand-alone product and provide M&S services to customers who purchased Mail Express in the past and who purchase it in the future. We do not expect to expend significant resources in the future expanding the features and capabilities of Mail Express as a standalone product.
 
Wide Area File Services Solution - WAFS
 
WAFS uses data synchronization to further enhance the ability to replicate, share and backup files within a wide area network or local area network, thereby allowing users to access their data at higher speeds than possible with most alternate approaches. The software uses byte-level differencing technology to update changes to files with minimal impact on network bandwidth while also ensuring that files are never overwritten, even if opened by other remote users. Other key features of WAFS include native file locking, replication to multiple locations simultaneously, adherence to access control list file permissions, and full UTF-8 support.
 
We will continue to offer WAFS as a stand-alone product and provide M&S services to customers who purchased WAFS in the past and who purchase it in the future. We do not expect to expend significant resources in the future expanding the features and capabilities of WAFS.
 
File Transfer Solution for Consumers - CuteFTP

CuteFTP is our original product introduced in 1996. It is a file transfer program generally used by individuals and small businesses. It remains popular today and generates incremental revenue for us at a relatively low cost.
 

13
 


CuteFTP continues to have significant brand recognition in the market.  Our current CuteFTP Version 9 introduced several notable new features including:
 
 
· | Support for Unicode (UTF-8) characters that allows greater international use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) support to facilitate collaboration between users in editing and managing documents and files stored on World Wide Web servers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 9 simplified our CuteFTP product line by consolidating all the features of our previous multi-product CuteFTP product line for Windows operating systems into this single version. We continue to offer CuteFTP Version 3.1 software for Mac platforms. We believe current versions of CuteFTP appeal to users wanting features more robust than offered in free alternatives such that it will be a product competitive in the marketplace for the foreseeable future.
 
We will continue selling CuteFTP as a stand-alone product and providing M&S services to customers who purchased CuteFTP in the past and who purchase it in the future but we will not invest significantly in marketing the product. We do not expect to expend significant resources in the future expanding the features and capabilities of CuteFTP.
 
Professional Services
 
We offer a range of professional services to complement our on-premises and SaaS solutions. These professional services include product configuration and system integration, solution “quickstart” implementations, business process and workflow refinement, policy development, education and training, and solution health checks. In addition, we may provide longer-term engineering services, including supporting multi-year contracts, if necessary, to support certain solution implementations and integrations. 
Maintenance and Support
 
We offer M&S contracts to licensees of all of our software products. These M&S contracts entitle the licensee to software upgrades and technical support services in accordance with the terms of our M&S contract.  Standard technical support services are provided via email and telephone during our regular business hours.  For certain of our products, we offer a Platinum M&S contract which provides access to emergency technical assistance 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.
 
Most of our M&S contracts are for one year although we also sell multi-year contracts. M&S is purchased by substantially all buyers of our EFT platform products as well as by many customers who purchase our other products. Customers with M&S contracts pay us a recurring, annual amount that is typically 20% to 30% of the software license price. A majority of our customers with M&S contracts renew them each year.
 
In 2017, we earned 61% of our revenue from M&S contracts. Sustaining that revenue stream is dependent upon our ability to continue selling new licenses for which customers purchase M&S services and to sustain a high renewal rate for existing M&S contracts.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
With the release of EFT Arcus, our next generation SaaS product, we continue to evolve towards becoming a cloud services company.  While we will continue to offer our products under perpetual licenses for our customers who want to install software on their premises and manage it themselves, we believe the market and the perspectives of our customers are quickly moving toward them demanding for their consideration the availability of a SaaS offering delivered from the cloud.
 
Our long-standing vision has been to simply and securely automate the flow of information between people, places and applications. Using that vision as a foundation, in 2018 we introduced a fundamentally new brand identity, logo and narrative that embodies our evolution to a cloud software and services provider. Our objective is to present ourselves as a cloud services company.
 
We conducted extensive interviews with and gathered feedback from customers in the marketplace as well as our own team members and shareholders. This input resulted in our adopting a new visual identity built upon a new tagline: “Make Business Flow Brilliantly”. We adopted a visual theme with a shifting background wave of colors representing the perpetual flow of data both within and between enterprises using our technology as a conduit through which the flow of business and the data it creates can be managed, monitored, controlled and viewed in a secure manner.
 

14
 


We emphasize developing our direct sales staff and reseller channel to capture sales through a high level of individual attention to the customer.  We provide our sales staff and resellers with training and professional development opportunities to ensure they are capable of meeting the needs of our prospects and customers. These sales team development activities focus on technical and process-oriented topical areas to enhance their ability to identify prospects, best position our solutions and develop pipeline opportunities into sales.
 
We believe our reseller and distributor channel relationships allow us to leverage those third-party resources to increase our market penetration. We have established such relationships throughout the world and across industry lines. In particular, we are focused on growing our domestic reseller channel.
 
Our marketing efforts focus on building brand awareness and capturing demand for our solutions. We take a two-pronged approach that includes a blend of digital and channel marketing. Through our digital marketing initiatives, we have invested heavily in content syndication programming, resulting in outbound targeted campaigns that more effectively reach the right audience with white papers, case studies and competitor comparisons. We also conduct ongoing search-engine optimization techniques and Pay Per Click advertising to enhance our ranking for particular key words in search results of major search engines. We continue to invest in channel marketing through programs designed to recruit and enable our target partners in a manner that creates joint initiatives that drive demand through them for our products. In addition, we are using our technology to meet the customer where they are shopping with placement in the Amazon Web Services and Azure marketplaces.
 
Our corporate website is www.globalscape.com . It provides a variety of sales and marketing information for our enterprise solutions as well as an ability to purchase some of our products online. We continually update the design of our websites to be responsive to the evolving marketplace and to provide a more solution-oriented perspective of our business, improve site navigation and provide additional opportunities for visitors to contact us through the websites.
 
Customers
 
We have sold our solutions throughout the world to individuals and enterprises ranging from SMBs to Fortune 100 companies. In order to leverage the resources of third parties, we make our products available for purchase by end users through third-party, channel resellers even though end users can also purchase those products directly from us. During 2017 and 2016, we earned a total of 29% and 39%, respectively, from resellers and approximately 14% of our revenue from such sales through our largest, third-party channel reseller. Although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on this distributor, if it were to experience a significant disruption of its business or if our relationship with it were to significantly deteriorate, it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be, at least temporarily, negatively impacted. We believe that such termination would not have a material adverse effect on us because we have engaged, or believe that we would be able to engage, alternative distributors, resellers and other distribution channels to deliver our products to end-customers shortly following the termination of any agreement with any distributor.
 
We derive a significant portion of our revenue from risk averse and/or regulated commercial customers in North America and throughout the world. Our primary commercial vertical markets include finance, health care, energy, retail, manufacturing, and engineering. We also have a customer base in the local, state, and federal government spaces. We continue to pursue additional government business by leveraging our certifications and industry validations.
 
Seasonality
 
Our products are marketed to individuals, SMBs and large organizations. As a result of this mix within our customer base, we typically have not experienced significant seasonality in our sales other than a typical modest decline from time-to-time in first quarter sales as compared to sales in the preceding fourth quarter. We believe this sales profile is related to our continued growth as an enterprise solution provider operating in an environment where first quarter sales possibly slow as prospective customers begin to execute their business activities, including purchases of our solutions, in accordance with new-year budgets and plans.
 
As a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives, we have historically received a substantial portion of orders from our customers and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each quarter. If a delay in an expected order for our products occurs near the end of a quarter this could result in revenue we expected to earn in that period being delayed until a subsequent quarter.
 

15
 

Network and Equipment
 
We conduct business through various Tier 1 Internet services providers.  Our arrangements provide for redundancy in the event of a failure and for expansion of available bandwidth in the event there is a dramatic increase in demand.  To protect critical customer data, our online shopping cart utilizes SSL encryption. We maintain technical and physical measures and procedures compliant with the PCI DSS. We use a certified Approved Scanning Vendor for security scans and PCI scan attestation.
 
We have dedicated servers on and off site and expansion plans in place to allow rapid and cost effective scalability.  Our offsite servers and data backup procedures provide a warm backup to our onsite servers for contingency purposes.  The backups are performed in accordance with our disaster recovery plan.
 
We rely on unrelated third parties to host on their computers our EFT Arcus product that we deliver to our customers under a SaaS model. We have contracts and/or service agreements in place with those third parties that we believe provide us the ability to continue delivering those products without interruption.
 
Research and Development
 
The technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware, operating systems and software. Our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve, as do their expectations of the performance of our software. To keep pace with these changes, we maintain an ongoing program of new product development to remain competitive and to address demands in the marketplace for our products.
 
Our internal software engineers are responsible for creating and building our software products. They do so by combining their expertise with input from our sales, marketing and product management groups as to market trends and needs. Our software engineers design and write software and manage its testing and quality assurance. We utilize third-party software developers both domestically and overseas working under our supervision to supplement our software engineers. Using these external software developers in a strategic manner allows us to access highly-skilled labor pools, maintain a 24-hour development schedule, decrease time to market, and minimize programming costs.
 
All phases of research and development, or R&D, including scope approval, functional and implementation design, object modeling and programming, are subject to extensive internal quality assurance testing.  We maintain an ongoing focus on improving our quality assurance testing infrastructure and practices. Technical reporting and customer support feedback from customers confirm the continuing positive effect of our ongoing enhancement of research and development and quality assurance processes.
 
Our EFT Arcus product is hosted by third-party cloud services providers. We are reliant upon those third parties, such as Microsoft Azure, for the continued development and enhancement of their cloud services infrastructures on which our products are hosted. We do not perform significant research and development of cloud services infrastructures using our own personnel.
 
Our R&D expenditures profile has been as follows ($ in thousands):
 

 | Year ending December 31, | 
-----------------------------+--------------------------+------
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 
R&D expenditures expensed | $ | 3,128 | | $ | 2,571
R&D expenditures capitalized | | 1,926 | | | 1,538
Total R&D expenditures | $ | 5,054 | | $ | 4,109

 
Total resources expended for R&D (set forth above as total R&D expenditures) illustrate our total corporate efforts to improve our existing products and to develop new products regardless of whether our expenditures for those efforts were expensed or capitalized. Total resources expended for R&D is not a measure of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for R&D expense (set forth above as R&D expenditures expensed) and capitalized software development costs (set forth above as R&D expenditures capitalized) individually. While we believe the non-GAAP, total resources expended for R&D amount provides useful supplemental information regarding our overall corporate product improvement and new product creation activities, there are limitations associated with the use of this non-GAAP measurement. Total resources expended for R&D is a non-GAAP measurement not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies since there is no standard for preparing this non-GAAP measurement. As a result, this non-GAAP measurement of total resources expended for R&D has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, R&D expense and capitalized software development cost individually.
 

16
 


Substantially all of our R&D expenditures relate to our EFT platform products with a relatively minor level of these expenditures being related to our other products. We expect to increase our research and development activities in future years as we focus on improving our current products and introduce new products.
 
Competition
 
The managed file transfer software market sector is highly competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of market participants.
 
The software industry has limited barriers to entry. The availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry. The software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of new competitors with innovative technologies. Competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve. Some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share, any of which could harm our business. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Operations” for further discussion of risks regarding competition.
 
We believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to better serve customers by offering new products whether by internal development or acquisition. We also believe we must continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use, reliability, performance, range of useful features, continuing product enhancements, reputation, price and training.
 
There is limited information regarding the market shares of our solutions in their respective categories.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, personnel, and other resources, as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base than we do. Significant competition characterizes the markets for our traditional MFT products. We anticipate we will continue to face increasing pricing pressures from competitors in the future. Given that there are low barriers to entry into the software market and that the market is subject to rapid technological change, we believe that competition will persist and intensify in the future.  For more discussion on the risks associated with our competition, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Operations”.
 
EFT Platform Products.  Our EFT Enterprise and EFT Arcus products compete against a number of secure, Windows-based FTP servers.  We believe our primary competitors are IBM, Axway, Accellion, Ipswitch, BMC, Cleo, Acronis, Signiant, Serv-U, and JSCAPE.  We believe the features and functions of our products are competitive with those of other MFT providers. In particular, we believe the ease of installation and use of our products combined with a competitive price well-position us to compete effectively in the MFT market.
 
We do not offer a Linux version of our EFT platform. Accordingly, we do not compete in environments in which the customer needs an MFT product that operates in a Linux operating system environment.
 
Delivering MFT products through a cloud-based, SaaS offering is a rapidly evolving sector of the markets in which we compete. Many of our MFT competitors are also introducing SaaS products. The nature of the SaaS delivery model lowers the barriers to entry into this market such that we expect competition in this area to intensify in the future.
 
CuteFTP.  CuteFTP exists in a highly competitive environment with numerous FTP software utilities available on the Internet for both the personal and professional user.  CuteFTP is positioned as one of the only secure FTP client programs that support a wide range of security standards related to the FTP protocol. We believe our primary competitors are consumer file transfer solutions sold by Ipswitch, Serv-U and Van Dyke Software, Inc.  CuteFTP was an early Windows-based FTP client to market and historically has been among the most frequently downloaded FTP clients on popular download sites.
 
WAFS.  WAFS competes in the wide area file services/storage market.  We believe our primary competitors are Panzura and Peer Sync, each of which is delivering proprietary appliances.  We believe that WAFS has the advantage of being a software-only solution which leverages corporate infrastructure and minimizes the total cost of ownership.
 

17
 


Mail Express.  Mail Express competes in areas of the file transfer market associated with email attachment offloading.  We believe our primary competitors are Leapfile, Zix, and Biscom.  Mail Express has the advantage of centralized policies for outbound file attachments and a transparent end-user experience, which allows for rapid customer deployments. Mail Express also has the benefit of integration with our most recent EFT release which provides customers with a more uniform administration experience for email attachment offloading and traditional MFT operations.
Governmental Regulation
 
Export Control Regulations.  All of our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and applicable foreign government import, export and/or use requirements.   The level of control generally depends on the nature of the goods and services in question. For example, the level of control is impacted by the nature of the software and encryption incorporated into our products.  Where controls apply, the export of our products may require an export license or authorization or that the transaction qualifies for a license exception or the equivalent, and may also be subject to corresponding reporting requirements.  For the export of some of our products, we may be subject to various post-shipment reporting requirements.  Minimal U.S. export restrictions apply to all of our products, whether or not they perform encryption functions.   Additionally, because we are a Department of Defense contractor, there are certain registration requirements that may be triggered by our sales.  In addition, certain of our items and/or transactions may be subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) if our software or services are specifically designed or modified for defense purposes.  Companies engaged in manufacturing or exporting ITAR-controlled goods and services (even if these companies do not export such items) are required to register with the U.S. State Department.
 
Enhancements to existing products may, and new products will, be subject to review under the Export Administration Act to determine what export classification they will receive. In light of the ongoing discussions regarding anti-terrorism legislation in the U.S. Congress, there continues to be discussions regarding the correct level of export control. Export regulations may be modified at any time. Modifications to the export regulations could reduce or eliminate our ability to export some or all of our products from the U.S. without a license in the future, which could put us at a disadvantage in competing for international sales compared to companies located outside of the U.S. that would not be subject to these restrictions.  Modifications to the export regulations could prevent us from exporting our existing and future products in an unrestricted manner without a license or make it more difficult to receive the desired classification. If export regulations were to be modified in such a way, we may be put at a competitive disadvantage with respect to selling our products internationally.  We are working on enhancing our systems to address the impact of these regulations on our products and services and understand the need to comply.  We will complete technical reviews on any new products that we acquire or develop that may be subject to these regulations before we can export them.
 
Privacy Laws.  As our business evolves to incorporate more cloud and SaaS solutions, we will receive, transmit, and store a greater volume and diversity of information. As a result, we may be subject to various international, federal and state regulations regarding the treatment and protection of personally identifying and other regulated information. Applicable laws may include, without limitation, U.S. federal laws and implementing regulations such as the GLBA and HIPAA, as well as state laws and regulations, and international laws and regulations including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which replaced the European Union Data Protection Directive in May 2018. Additionally, some of these laws have requirements on the transmittal of data from one jurisdiction to another. In the event our systems are compromised by an unauthorized party, many of these privacy laws require that we provide notices to our customers whose personally identifiable data we reasonably believe may have been compromised. Additionally, if we transfer data in violation of these laws, we could be subjected to substantial fines. To mitigate the risk of compromised information, we use encryption and other security to protect our databases. We also have adopted policies to comply with the GDPR in the European Union.
Intellectual Property
 
We regard some of the features of our internal operations, our software, our brands and marketing message, and our documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright, patent, and trademark and service mark laws and trade secret protection, such as confidentiality procedures, contractual arrangements, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary information. Our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products, services, and technology and enhance our competitive position and market value.
 
As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees and independent contractors, resellers, and corporate partners. We enter into license or subscription services agreements with respect to our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Our standard license agreements are transferable only in limited circumstances and have a perpetual term. Our subscription services agreements for our hosted and managed solutions restrict access and have a definite term. We also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities, equipment, and networks.

In addition to the United States trademarks listed above, we have trademarks registered in Canada and the European Union for GlobalSCAPE. We have obtained United States copyright registrations for all but the most recent versions of our software applications.  We have two patents in the United States.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.  Policing unauthorized use of our products, which are licensed by the thousands and sold world-wide, is difficult.  While we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists, software piracy is a persistent problem.  In selling our products, we rely primarily on click-wrap licenses which are not signed in writing by licensees and may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions.  Additionally, our new offerings through Microsoft Azure require the platform to present the applicable licensing terms and if we cannot prove that a licensee received the intended notice of the license terms, we may have difficulty enforcing the applicable agreements. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States.  Companies in the software industry, and other patent and trademark holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.  We have received, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of third parties, seeking damages resulting from such infringement or indicating that we may be required to obtain a license from or pay a royalty to, such third parties.  For more discussion on the risks associated with our intellectual property, you should read the information under “Risk Factors,” especially “Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”

Investigation
 
On August 7, 2017, GlobalSCAPE announced that the Audit Committee, assisted by outside legal counsel and independent forensic accountants, had been conducting an investigation into certain transactions in the fourth quarter of 2016. We have since publicly disclosed multiple updates regarding the Investigation. The Investigation, which is now complete, identified  transactions which were recorded inconsistently with the Company’s stated revenue recognition policies and criteria as described in our discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 below.

Subsequent to the announcement of the Investigation on August 7, 2017, the Audit Committee and management identified additional transactions which occurred during fiscal year 2016 in which revenue was recorded inconsistently with the Company’s stated revenue recognition policies and criteria including:
 
 
· | Transactions in which license activation keys did not appear to have been delivered to the customer in the period in which the sale was recorded;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transactions appearing to contain side deal terms negotiated with customers but not reflected in the underlying sales documentation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transactions in which a sale was recorded although the customer had not yet responded to the Company’s request to provide a commitment to purchase;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transactions in which a sale was made to a reseller whereby collection was not reasonably assured due to payment or other nonstandard terms not consistent with the Company’s revenue recognition policy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transactions in which there was either no purchase order or a purchase order dated after the date of the end of the period for which revenue had been previously recognized; and

Additionally, management adjusted our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 to account for immaterial misstatements. These changes in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 were in addition to the changes previously disclosed in our original Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed March 27, 2017, as a result of changes in accounting methods and in the classification and presentation of our business activities in our consolidated financial statements.
 
As a result of the Investigation and management’s analysis, we restated (i) our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and (ii) our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
