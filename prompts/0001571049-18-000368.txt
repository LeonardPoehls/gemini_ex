BUSINESS 
 ​
 Overview 
 We are a global provider of core insurance platform solutions, consulting services and other insurance solutions for business transformation of the insurance industry. In addition to the United States, we operate in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and India. We offer core insurance platform solutions for Property & Casualty/General Insurance (“P&C”), and Life, Annuities, Pensions and Group/Benefits (“L&A and Group”) providers, enabling them to automate and manage business processes across the end-to-end insurance value chain and comply with policies and regulations across their organizations. In addition, we offer a variety of other technology-based solutions for distribution management, digital, data and cloud. Our consulting services solutions provide enterprise consulting, application development management and testing for insurers. Our portfolio of solutions enable our customers to respond to evolving market needs, growth and innovation opportunities and regulatory changes, which enables agility, innovation and speed while improving the effectiveness and efficiency of their business operations. 
 Majesco is a California corporation which was incorporated in April 1992 under the name Mastek Software, Inc. In 1995, this name was changed to Majesco Software, Inc., which was changed to MajescoMastek in 2006 and to Majesco in October 2014. 
 Our principal offices are located at 412 Mount Kemble Ave, Suite 110C, Morristown, NJ 07960, and our telephone number is (973) 461-5200. Our principal website is www.majesco.com. Information on our website does not constitute a part of, nor is it incorporated in any way, into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Majesco Reorganization 
 Majesco Limited (“Majesco Limited”), a public limited company domiciled in India whose equity shares are listed on the BSE Limited (Bombay Stock Exchange) and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited, currently owns 69.75% of our issued and outstanding common stock. 
 Previously, Majesco was 100% owned (directly and indirectly) by Mastek Limited (“Mastek”), a public limited company domiciled in India whose equity shares are listed on the BSE Limited and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. 
 Pursuant to a de-merger process which was completed on June 1, 2015, Mastek’s insurance-related business was separated from Mastek’s non-insurance related businesses and all insurance-related operations of Mastek that were not directly owned by Majesco were contributed to Majesco (such de-merger and reorganization process is referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the “Majesco Reorganization”). 
 In connection with the de-merger, 83.5% of Mastek’s then ownership interest in Majesco was transferred to a newly-formed company in India, called Majesco Limited, which was spun-off from Mastek. Mastek continues to own a 13.78% indirect minority interest in Majesco through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mastek (UK) Ltd. 
 Agile Asset Acquisition 
 On January 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the insurance consulting business of Agile Technologies LLC, a business and technology management consulting firm (“Agile”), for a total estimated consideration of approximately $8.5 million with a total maximum of $9.2 million potentially payable as earn-out payments. 
 Through this acquisition, we acquired the insurance-focused business and IT consulting business of Agile, as well as business transformation and process optimization capabilities, strategy enablement for data and digital and data services including data management and architecture strategy and services. In connection with this acquisition, over 55 insurance technology professionals and other personnel formerly

 employed or engaged by Agile became employees or independent contractors of Majesco. This acquisition also resulted in the addition of approximately 20 customers to our customer base. In connection with this acquisition, we assumed office leases under which Agile was lessee in New Jersey, Georgia and Ohio, and acquired certain trademarks, service marks, domain names and the business process framework of Agile. 
Cover-All Technologies Merger 
 On June 26, 2015, Cover-All Technologies Inc. (“Cover-All”), a provider of core insurance software and business analytics solution primarily focused on commercial lines for the P&C insurance industry listed on the NYSE American (formerly, the NYSE MKT), merged into Majesco, with Majesco as the surviving corporation, in a stock-for-stock transaction. In the merger, each share of Cover-All common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than treasury shares) was automatically cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive 0.21641 shares of common stock of Majesco. This exchange ratio resulted in holders of issued and outstanding Cover-All common stock and outstanding options and restricted stock units and other equity awards of Cover-All holding in the aggregate approximately 16.5% of the total capitalization of the combined company immediately following consummation of the merger. 
 Cover-All’s customers include insurance companies, agents, brokers and managing general agents (“MGAs”) throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Cover-All’s software solutions and services are designed to enable customers to introduce new products quickly, expand their distribution channels, reduce costs and improve service to their customers. Cover-All’s business analytics solution enables customers to leverage their information assets for real time business insights and for better risk selection, pricing and financial reporting. In 2013, Cover-All announced the general availability of Cover-All Dev Studio, a visual configuration platform for building new and maintaining existing pre-built commercial insurance products for Cover-All Policy. In 2011, Cover-All expanded its portfolio of insurance solutions by acquiring the assets of a recognized claims solution provider, Ho’ike Services, Inc. (doing business as BlueWave Technology). 
 In connection with the merger, we listed our common stock on the NYSE American under the symbol “MJCO” and began trading under this symbol following the consummation of the merger.

 Business 
 We have been operating in the insurance industry for more than twenty years, successfully partnering with market leading insurance companies and enabling them to transform their business, introduce innovative products, and expand distribution channels to generate growth and increase profitability. We are a global provider of core insurance platform solutions and consulting services for insurance business transformation for P&C, L&A and Group providers, allowing them to enable the entire insurance value chain. We offer a portfolio of platform solutions and consulting services for all lines of business and all tiers of insurers. The portfolio includes core insurance platform solutions for policy, rating, underwriting, billing, claims, distribution management, digital and data and analytics as well as consulting services for enterprise consulting, digital, data, testing and application development and maintenance. 
 Long-term, strong customer relationships are a key component of our success given the long-term nature of our contracts, and provide an opportunity for deeper relationships using our portfolio of solutions. They provide critical customer references for new sales. Our customers range from some of the 

 2

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 largest global tier one insurance carriers in the industry to mid-market insurers, MGAs, startups and greenfields, including specialty, mutual and regional carriers. As of March 31, 2018, we served approximately 160 insurance customers on a worldwide basis. For fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we served approximately 148, 149, 108 and 97 insurance customers on a worldwide basis, respectively. 
 We generate revenue from our global IP led business as well as from engagements in the insurance services space. The IP business is primarily driven through either an on-premise deployment or deployment of the platform on the cloud. While the on-premise model generates revenues from the licensing of our proprietary software (perpetual or annual license fees), related implementation and support and maintenance fees pursuant to contracts with customers, we have been witnessing a significant shift in the business model with customers preferring the cloud model which offers a speed to value benefit together with low upfront investments. The revenues from the cloud model are led by an implementation/​configuration contract and followed by monthly subscriptions once the platform is in production for the customer to use. The implementation contracts for both the models are on a time and material or fixed bid basis. License fees, support and maintenance and cloud subscription fees are usually managed through multi-year agreements which are typically over a period of five to seven years. Insurance services revenues is primarily driven by professional services offered in the areas of transformation consulting, data, digital, testing and application development and management.

 •

 ​
 Overview of the Insurance Industry 
 The insurance industry is large, fragmented, highly regulated and complex. In order to effectively manage their operations, insurance carriers require core business systems that integrate with other internal systems, control workflow, enable extensive configurability and provide visibility to every user. 
 The insurance industry is in the midst of profound change fueled by trends that are converging and pushing a sometimes slow-to-adapt industry. This seismic shift is creating leaps in innovation and disruption, challenging the traditional business assumptions, operations, processes and products of the last 30 to 50 years represented as Insurance 1.0. Insurance carriers are currently faced with a wide range of

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 challenges. Increasing competition, emerging technologies and changing customer expectations are pushing carriers to make their business more agile, improve their time to market for new products, reach new markets, expand channels and respond quickly to market changes, moving to Digital Insurance 2.0. 
 Many insurance carriers are experiencing increased operational risk and financial loss due to the inadequacy of their existing legacy core systems to meet the needs of Digital Insurance 2.0. The inherent functional and technical limitations of these systems have impeded carriers’ ability to grow profitability and adapt to the evolving expectations of consumer, commercial and government insurance customers. Most organizations cannot simply flip off one switch (traditional business model and products administered on traditional systems) and flip another on (new business model and products on modern, flexible systems that will handle digital integration and better data acquisition and analysis). So, the shift will require steps. Those steps will operate as both a bridge and a proving ground, with the traditional system still operational as a firm foundation while the new foundation is being constructed.

 Major Customers 
 As of March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our product line was in use in approximately 160, 148 and 149 companies worldwide, respectively. For fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 we had no customer contributing 10% or more of total revenues. For fiscal 2016, we had one customer contributing 10% or more of total revenues. For fiscal 2016, our largest customer was Unum, with approximately 10.2% of total revenues. 
 For fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 our top five customers generated approximately 28.4%, 27.1% and 26.5% of revenue, respectively. We expect that the top five customers will continue to account for a significant portion of revenue for the foreseeable future. 
 Backlog 
 As of March 31, 2018, we had unrecognized licenses and support services or professional services backlog of unbilled work totaling $90.6 million, which are expected to be recognized by March 31, 2019. 
 As of March 31, 2017, we had unrecognized licenses and support services or professional services backlog of unbilled work totaling $64 million, which we recognized as of March 31, 2018. 
 Research and Development 
 We continue to enhance the business and technical capabilities of our market leading solution portfolio for insurance carriers through consistent significant R&D investment in core platform software, cloud, distribution, data, digital and services for innovative and scalable solutions. For fiscal 2018 we spent $17,250 on R&D compared to $17,236 in fiscal 2017. 
Capital Expenditures 
 As a growing company, we have on-going capital expenditure needs based on our short term and long term business plans. Although our requirements for capital expenses vary from time to time, for the next twelve months, we anticipate incurring capital expenditures of $3,000 to $4,000 for new business development activities and infrastructure enhancements. 
 We believe that our current cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our normal operating needs for at least the next twelve months. These projections include anticipated sales to new customers and upsell/cross sell to existing customers, the exact timing of which cannot be predicted with absolute certainty and can be influenced by factors outside our control. Our 

 7

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 ability to fund our working capital needs and address planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We anticipate generating future working capital through sales to new customers and continued sales and services to our existing customers. 
 Our future liquidity and capital resource requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following trends and uncertainties we face and those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors”: 
 •

 Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. 
 ​
 •

 Our need to invest resources in product development in order to continue to enhance our current products, develop new products, attract and retain customers and keep pace with competitive product introductions and technological developments. 
 ​
 •

 We experience competition in our industry and continuing technological changes. 
 ​
 •

 Insurance companies typically are slow in making decisions and have numerous bureaucratic and institutional obstacles, which can make our efforts to attain new customers difficult. 
 ​
 •

 We compete on the basis of insurance knowledge, products, services, price, technological advances and system functionality and performance. 
 ​
 We do not expect for there to be a need for a change in the mix or relative cost of our sources of capital.
