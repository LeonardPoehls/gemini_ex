Item 1. Business.
General
CSS Industries, Inc. (“CSS” or the “Company”) is a creative consumer products company, focused on the seasonal, gift and craft categories. For these design-driven categories, the Company engages in the creative development, manufacture, procurement, distribution and sale of our products with an omni-channel approach focused primarily on mass market retailers. 
Seasonal The seasonal category includes gift packaging items such as ribbon, bows, greeting cards, wrapping paper, bags, boxes, tags and gift card holders, in addition to specific holiday-themed decorations, accessories, and activities, such as Easter egg dyes and novelties and Valentine's Day classroom exchange cards. These products are sold to mass market retailers, and production forecasts for these products are generally known well in advance of shipment. 
Gift The gift category (formerly described by the Company as its celebrations category) includes products designed to celebrate certain life events or special occasions, such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, or the birth of a child. Products include ribbons and bows, floral accessories, infant products, journals, gift card holders, all occasion boxed greeting cards, memory books, scrapbooks, stationery, stickers and other items that commemorate life's celebrations. Products in this category are primarily sold into mass and specialty retailers, floral and packaging wholesalers and distributors, and are generally ordered on a replenishment basis throughout the year. 
Craft The craft category includes ribbons, trims, buttons, sewing patterns, knitting needles, needle arts and kids' crafts. These products are sold to mass market and specialty retailers, and are generally ordered on a replenishment basis throughout the year.
CSS’ product breadth provides its retail customers the opportunity to use a single vendor for much of their seasonal, gift and craft product requirements. A substantial portion of CSS’ products are manufactured and packaged in the United States and warehoused and distributed from facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, with the remainder sourced from foreign suppliers, primarily in Asia. The Company also has a manufacturing facility in India that produces certain craft products, including trims, braids and tassels, and also has a distribution facility in India. The Company’s products are sold to its customers by national and regional account sales managers, sales representatives, product specialists and by a network of independent manufacturers’ representatives. CSS maintains purchasing offices in Hong Kong and China to administer Asian sourcing opportunities. 
A key aspect of the Company’s strategy is to reposition its portfolio primarily through acquisitions within the categories that the Company currently operates. The highly fragmented nature of the categories in which the Company operates creates opportunities to grow through acquisition. As a result, the Company actively meets with craft, gift and seasonal companies to assess potential fit against our pre-defined parameters, seeking to deploy its cash to grow through acquisition. 
The overall objective of the Company is to grow profitable sales and improve return on invested capital ("ROIC") through five strategic pillars. These strategic pillars include:
*Defend the base business - Design, product innovation, category leadership

* | Identify adjacent product categories with a focus on brands - Focus on fragmented markets, brands, omni-channel

*Build an omni-channel business model - Dedicated resources, leverage technology

* | Improve ROIC by maximizing margins while minimizing capital investment - Fix underperforming product lines, focus on working capital

*Build a collaborative, dynamic One CSS culture - Communication, accountability, talent infusion

CSS operates nineteen manufacturing and/or distribution facilities located in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Alabama, Illinois, Kansas, the United Kingdom, Australia and India. A description of the Company’s product lines and related manufacturing and/or distribution facilities is as follows:

• | Ribbon and bows are primarily manufactured and warehoused in eight facilities located in Pennsylvania, Maryland, South Carolina and Alabama. The manufacturing process is vertically integrated. Non-woven ribbon and bow products are primarily made from polypropylene resin, a petroleum-based product, which is mixed with color pigment, melted and pressed through an extruder. Large rolls of extruded film go through various combinations of manufacturing processes before being made into bows or packaged on ribbon spools or reels as required by various markets and customers. Woven fabric ribbons are manufactured domestically or imported from Mexico and Asia. Imported woven products are either narrow woven or converted from bulk rolls of wide width textiles. Domestic woven products are narrow woven. 


• | Infant products, journals, educational products, memory books, scrapbooks, stationery, and other gift items are imported from Asian manufacturers and warehoused and distributed from two distribution facilities in Alabama.


• | Floral accessories, including pot covers, foil, waxed tissue, shred, aisle runners, corsage bags and other paper and film products, are manufactured in a facility located in New Hampshire or imported from Mexico. Manufacturing includes gravure and flexo printing, waxing and converting. Products are warehoused and distributed from a distribution facility in Pennsylvania. 


• | Sewing patterns are purchased and distributed from a third party printer and are also manufactured and distributed from a facility located in Kansas. Sewing patterns are also warehoused and distributed from two distribution facilities in the United Kingdom and two distribution facilities in Australia. 


• | Certain craft items, including trims, braids and tassels, are manufactured and distributed from two facilities in India.

Other products including, but not limited to, buttons, knitting needles, needle arts, kids crafts, boxed greeting cards, gift tags, gift card holders, gift bags, gift wrap, decorative tissue paper, classroom exchange Valentine's Day products, Easter products, and decorations are produced to the specifications of CSS and are imported primarily from Asian manufacturers.
During our 2018 fiscal year, CSS experienced no material difficulties in obtaining raw materials or finished goods from suppliers.
Intellectual Property Rights CSS has a number of copyrights, patents, tradenames, trademarks and intellectual property licenses which are used in connection with its products. Substantially all of its designs and artwork are protected by copyright. Intellectual property license rights which CSS has obtained are viewed as especially important to the success of its classroom exchange Valentine's Day cards and stickers. It is CSS’ view that its operations are not dependent upon any individual patent, tradename, trademark, copyright or intellectual property license. The collective value of CSS’ intellectual property is viewed as substantial, and CSS seeks to protect its rights in all patents, copyrights, tradenames, trademarks and intellectual property licenses.
Sales and Marketing Most of CSS’ products are sold in the United States and Canada by national and regional account sales managers, sales representatives, product specialists and by a network of independent manufacturers’ representatives. CSS maintains permanent showrooms in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arkansas, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Hong Kong and Australia where buyers for major retail customers will typically visit for a presentation and review of the new lines. Products are also displayed and presented in showrooms maintained by various independent manufacturers’ representatives in major cities in the United States and Canada. Relationships are developed with key retail customers by CSS sales personnel and independent manufacturers’ representatives. Social stationery products are sold by a national organization of sales representatives that specialize in the gift and specialty channel, as well as by key account representatives. Craft ribbon and bow products are also sold through sales representatives or independent manufacturers’ representatives to wholesale distributors and independent small retailers who serve the floral, craft and retail packaging trades. The Company also sells custom products to private label customers, to other social expression companies, and to converters of the Company’s ribbon products. Custom products are sold by both independent manufacturers’ representatives and CSS sales managers.

Customers are generally mass market retailers, discount department stores, specialty chains, warehouse clubs, drug and food chains, dollar stores, office supply stores, independent card, gift and floral shops and retail teachers’ stores. Net sales to Walmart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates accounted for approximately 25% of total net sales during fiscal 2018. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales in fiscal 2018. Our ten largest customers, which include mass market retailers, warehouse clubs and national drug store chains, accounted for approximately 61% of our sales in our 2018 fiscal year. Approximately 66% of the Company’s sales are attributable to gift and craft products with the remainder attributable to seasonal (Christmas, Valentine’s Day, Easter and back to-school) products. Approximately 24% of CSS’ sales relate to the Christmas season. Seasonal products are generally designed and marketed beginning up to 18 to 20 months before the holiday event and manufactured during an eight to ten month production cycle. Due to these long lead time requirements, timely communication with third party factories, licensors, customers and independent manufacturers’ representatives is critical to the timely production of seasonal products. Sales terms for our seasonal products do not generally require payment until just before or just after the holiday, in accordance with industry practice. CSS products, with some customer specific exceptions, are not sold under guaranteed or return privilege terms. The Company has certain limited products, primarily sewing patterns, that are on consignment at mass market retailers and the Company recognizes the sale as products are sold to end consumers at point-of-sale terminals.
Competition among retailers in the sale of the Company’s products to end users is intense. CSS seeks to assist retailers in developing merchandising programs designed to enable the retailers to meet their revenue and profit objectives while appealing to their consumers’ tastes. These objectives are met through the development and manufacture of custom configured and designed products and merchandising programs. CSS’ years of experience in merchandising program development and product quality are key competitive advantages in helping retailers meet their objectives.
Competition CSS competes with various domestic and foreign companies in each of its seasonal, gift and craft categories. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company while many are smaller, private companies that we compete with across our product lines. CSS believes its products are competitively positioned in their primary markets. Since competition is based primarily on category knowledge, timely delivery, creative design, price and, with respect to seasonal products, the ability to serve major retail customers with single, combined product shipments for each holiday event, CSS believes that its focus on products, combined with consistent service levels, allows it to compete effectively in its core markets.
Backlog Production forecasts for products within our seasonal category are generally known well in advance of shipment. Orders for products within our gift and craft categories are generally ordered on a just-in-time replenishment basis by our customers and an order backlog does not typically exist, except when major program resets occur. 
The Company’s fiscal year ends on March 31. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in March of that year. For example, fiscal 2018 refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
Employees
At June 1, 2018, approximately 2,000 persons were employed by CSS (increasing to approximately 2,075 as seasonal employees are added). The Company believes that relationships with its employees are good.
With the exception of the bargaining unit at the ribbon manufacturing facility in Hagerstown, Maryland, which totaled 80 employees as of June 1, 2018, CSS employees are not represented by labor unions. Because of the seasonal nature of certain of its businesses, the number of production employees fluctuates during the year. The collective bargaining agreement with the labor union representing the Hagerstown-based production and maintenance employees remains in effect until December 31, 2020. Historically, we have been successful in renegotiating expiring agreements without any disruption of operating activities.
Acquisitions
The Company will continue to build on existing relationships with seasonal, gift and craft customers by expanding and diversifying its product lines and thereby growing its presence in the largest retailers in North America. This includes both capitalizing on opportunities for organic growth in existing businesses as well as acquiring companies which fit into appropriate acquisition parameters. We actively meet with seasonal, gift and craft companies to review and assess potential acquisition targets.
On November 3, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the net assets and business of Simplicity Creative Group ("Simplicity") from Wilton Brands LLC ("Wilton") for a total consideration of $69,617,000 and transaction costs of approximately $3,411,000.

The Company primarily financed the acquisition with borrowings of $60,000,000 under its revolving credit facility and has recorded a working capital adjustment due to Wilton of $2,500,000, which is recorded in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and was paid on April 4, 2018. A portion of the purchase price is being held in escrow for certain post closing adjustments and indemnification obligations. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired of $9,642,000 was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill was subsequently written off as a result of the Company’s annual impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as further described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
On December 13, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the net assets and business of The McCall Pattern Company and certain affiliated subsidiaries ("McCall"), for approximately $13,914,000 in cash, plus transaction costs of approximately $1,484,000. McCall designs, manufactures, and sells home sewing patterns under the McCall’s®, Butterick®, Kwik Sew® and Vogue Patterns® brand names. McCall is a leading provider of home sewing patterns, selling to mass market retailers, specialty fabric and craft chains, and wholesale distributors. A portion of the purchase price is being held in escrow for certain post closing adjustments and indemnification obligations. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and resulted in a bargain purchase due to the fair value of the net assets acquired of approximately $33,528,000 exceeding the amount paid. In connection with this bargain purchase, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $19,614,000 in the consolidated statements of operations in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. 
On July 8, 2016, a subsidiary of the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Lawrence Schiff Silk Mills, Inc. ("Schiff") for $1,125,000 in cash. Schiff was a leading U.S. manufacturer and distributor of narrow woven ribbon prior to its April 2016 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and resulted in a bargain purchase due to the fair value of the net assets acquired of approximately $1,501,000 exceeding the amount paid. In connection with this bargain purchase, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $376,000 in the consolidated statements of operations in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
On February 2, 2016, a subsidiary of the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the net assets and business of Blumenthal Lansing Company, LLC ("Blumenthal") for approximately $19,626,000 in cash, including transaction costs of approximately $81,000. The Company also incurred costs of approximately $1,028,000 in fiscal 2016, primarily related to severance. Blumenthal was a leading provider of buttons to the sewing and craft markets in the United States, selling to mass market retailers and wholesale distributors that service independent retail stores. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method, and $4,017,000, which is the excess of cost over fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill was subsequently written off as a result of the Company’s annual impairment testing performed in fiscal 2018 as further described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
