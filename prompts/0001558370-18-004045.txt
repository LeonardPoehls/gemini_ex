 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS (AS REVISED FOR THE RESTATEMENT)
 OVERVIEW
 We are Gener8 Maritime, Inc., a leading U.S.‑based provider of international seaborne crude oil transportation services, resulting from a transformative merger between General Maritime Corporation, a well‑known tanker owner, and Navig8 Crude Tankers Inc., a company sponsored by the Navig8 Group, an independent vessel pool manager. General Maritime Corporation was founded in 1997 by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Peter Georgiopoulos, and we have been an active owner, operator and consolidator in the crude tanker sector. As of March 9, 2018, we owned a fleet of 30 tankers, consisting of 21 Very Large Crude Carriers (“VLCCs”), six Suezmax vessels, one Aframax vessel and two Panamax vessels, with an aggregate carrying capacity of 7.5 million deadweight tons, or “DWT”. See “Our Fleet” below for a list of all our ships.
 Our fleet is employed worldwide. As of March 9, 2018, approximately 84% of our total fleet carrying capacity based on DWT is focused on VLCC vessels. We have seen an increase in trip length and ton‑miles in the tanker market due to shifting trade patterns and believe that VLCC vessels are uniquely positioned to benefit from such increase and provide operational benefits due to economies of scale.
 We seek to maximize long‑term cash flow, taking into account current freight rates in the market and our own views on the direction of those rates in the future. Historically our spot and charter exposures have varied as we continually evaluate our charter employment strategy and the trade‑off between shorter spot voyages and longer‑term charters. For the years ended December 31, 2017, we had approximately 94.2%, of our vessel operating days exposed to the short‑term charter market, via employment in pools.
 Pools generally consist of a number of vessels that may be owned by a number of different ship owners which operate as a single marketing entity in an effort to produce freight efficiencies. Pools typically employ experienced commercial charterers and operators who have close working relationships with customers and brokers, while technical management is typically the responsibility of each ship owner. We believe that pool participation optimizes various operational efficiencies including improving the potential to monetize freight spikes, greater flexibility of voyage planning and fleet positioning, and reduction of waiting times. In addition to these competitive advantages, pool participation provides us with greater access to key market dynamics and information. As of December 31, 2017, all of our VLCC and Suezmax vessels were employed in Navig8 Group commercial crude tanker pools, which we refer to as the “Navig8 pools.”
 We maintain strong relationships with high quality customers, including Saudi Aramco, BP, Shell, S‑Oil, Exxon, Chevron, Repsol, Valero, Reliance, Petrobras and Clearlake, either directly or through pooling arrangements. We believe the substantial scale of the global tanker pools in which we participate will provide with freight optimization and cost benefits through economies of scale, as well as greater access to key market dynamics and information. Additionally, we expect that our “eco” vessels deployed in the Navig8 pools will be able to earn higher returns relative to older, non‑eco vessels that may be contributed, as fuel consumption is a significant determinant of pool earnings distributed to shipowners.
 Our New York City‑based executive management team includes executives with extensive experience in the shipping industry who have a long track record of managing the commercial, technical and financial aspects of our business.
 In executing our strategy, our practice is to acquire or dispose of secondhand vessels, newbuilding contracts, or shipping companies while focusing on maximizing shareholder value and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate.
 We are incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. We maintain our principal executive offices at 299 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10171. Our telephone number at that address is

 THE MERGER
 On December 20, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Euronav NV (“Euronav”) and Euronav MI Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Euronav (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into Gener8, with Gener8 continuing its corporate existence as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Euronav (which transactions we refer to as the “Merger”).
 At the effective time of the Merger, each common share, par value $0.01 per share, of Gener8 (the “Gener8 common shares”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to such time (other than certain Gener8 common shares that will be canceled as set forth in the Merger Agreement), will be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive 0.7272 of an ordinary share, no par value per share, of Euronav (such ratio, the “Exchange Ratio”, and the Euronav ordinary shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger, the “Merger Consideration”) in the manner described in the Merger Agreement.
 Any Gener8 common shares held by Gener8, Euronav, Merger Sub, or their respective subsidiaries will be canceled and no consideration will be delivered for those canceled shares.
 The completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, the approval of the Merger Agreement by holders of a majority of the outstanding Gener8 common shares. There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to complete the Merger. Each party’s obligation to complete the Merger is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to certain qualifications and exceptions) and the performance in all material respects of the other party’s covenants under the Merger Agreement. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Related to the

Merger.” Unless the context otherwise indicates, the disclosure and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not give effect to the Merger.
 Pursuant to a voting agreement (which we refer to as the “Voting Agreement”), certain significant holders of Gener8 common shares representing approximately 42% of the issued and outstanding shares of Gener8 have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of such Voting Agreement, to (i) appear (in person or by proxy) at any meeting of the shareholders convened for the purpose of approving the Merger and the Merger Agreement  (the “Special Meeting”)and (ii) provided that neither the Gener8 Transaction Committee nor the Gener8 board of directors has made an Adverse Recommendation Change (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), vote all of their Gener8 common shares (the “Covered Shares”) in favor of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and against any action that would reasonably be expected to impede the Merger or result in a breach of the Merger Agreement or the Voting Agreement. If either the Gener8 Transaction Committee or the Gener8 board of directors does make an Adverse Recommendation Change, then the Covered Shareholders are each required to vote 50% of their respective Covered Shares in favor of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and may vote their remaining Covered Shares in any manner they determine.
 In addition, at the request (and expense) of Euronav, certain Gener8 shareholders (the “Proxy Shareholders”) have agreed to grant an irrevocable proxy (the “Proxies”) to a representative of an affiliate of such Proxy Shareholders whereby, subject to the terms and conditions in the Proxies, such representative has the authority to direct the vote of Gener8 common shares owned by the Proxy Shareholders, representing in the aggregate approximately 6% of the issued and outstanding shares of Gener8, at the Special Meeting. In addition, the Proxy Shareholders have agreed, among other things, not to transfer or dispose any of their Gener8 common shares during the term of the Proxies unless the transferee agrees to be bound thereby. Please see the section “The Merger Agreement — Voting Agreement and Proxy”.
 For more information about the Merger, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on December 22, 2017.
 GOING CONCERN
 The Company’s operations, cash flows, liquidity, and its ability to comply with financial covenants related to its senior secured credit facilities have been negatively impacted by a weaker tanker industry, lower charter rates, and higher interest costs on its outstanding indebtedness whereby the Company incurred a net loss of $168.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and had an accumulated deficit of $264.7 million as of December 31, 2017.  Management considered the significance of these negative financial conditions in relation to the Company’s ability to meet its current and future obligations and determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as of December 31, 2017.  The financial statements included in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplate the realization of assets and extinguishment of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other things, our ability to: (i) develop and successfully implement a plan to address these factors, which may include refinancing our existing credit agreements, or obtaining waivers or modifications to our credit agreements from our lenders, raising additional capital through selling assets (including vessels), reducing or delaying capital expenditures or pursuing other options that may be available to us, which may include pursuing strategic opportunities and equity or debt offerings; (ii) return to profitability, and (iii) remain in compliance with our credit facility covenants, as the same may be modified. The realization of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities are subject to uncertainty. The financial statements included in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data do not include any direct adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.   For more information on the negative financial conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and management’s plans, see Note 21, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

 BUSINESS STRATEGY
 Our strategy is to leverage our competitive strengths to enhance our position within the industry and maximize long term shareholder returns. Our strategic initiatives include:

· | Optimize our vessel deployment to maximize shareholder returns. We seek to employ our vessels in a manner that maximizes fleet utilization and earnings upside through our chartering strategy in line with our goal of maximizing shareholder value and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate. We believe our participation in the Navig8 pools provides us with unique benefits, including access to both scale and superior utilization, versus the broader market. We believe these pools allow us to capture additional opportunities as they become available. Our management actively monitors market conditions and changes in charter rates to seek to achieve optimal vessel deployment for our fleet, which may include entering our vessels into time charters when appropriate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain cost efficient operations. We outsource the technical management of our fleet to experienced third party managers who have specific teams dedicated to our vessels. We believe the technical management cost at third party managers is lower than what we could achieve by performing the function in house. We seek to aggressively manage our operating and maintenance costs and quality by actively overseeing and directing the activities of the third party technical managers and by monitoring and controlling vessel operating expenses they incur on our behalf.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Operate a young, high quality fleet and continue to safely and effectively serve our customers. We intend to maintain a high quality fleet that meets or exceeds stringent industry standards and complies with charterer requirements through our technical managers’ rigorous and comprehensive maintenance programs under our active oversight. Our fleet has a strong safety and environmental record that we maintain through regular maintenance and inspection. We believe that the “eco” design of 19 of our VLCCs, as well as the extensive experience from our technical managers and our in house oversight team, will enhance our position as a preferred provider to oil major customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Opportunistically engage in acquisitions or disposals to maximize shareholder value. Our practice is to acquire or dispose of secondhand vessels, newbuilding contracts, or shipping companies while focusing on maximizing shareholder value and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate. Our executive management team has a demonstrated track record in sourcing and executing acquisitions and disposals at attractive points in the cycle and financings. We are continuously and actively monitoring the market in an effort to take advantage of growth opportunities. We believe that the demand created by changing oil trade pattern distances has been most significant in the VLCC sector as those ships have been directed largely to long haul trade routes to China. Consistent with our strategy, we purchased 21 “eco” VLCC newbuildings in 2014 and 2015, of which all were delivered as of December 31, 2017. In 2017, we completed the sale of five VLCC vessels (the Gener8 Zeus, Gener8 Ulysses, Gener8 Theseus, Gener8 Noble and Gener8 Poseidon), four Suezmax vessels (the Gener8 Argus, Gener8 Horn, Gener8 Phoenix and Gener8 Orion) and three Aframax vessels (the Gener8 Pericles, Gener8 Elektra and Gener8 Daphne).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Actively manage capital structure and return capital to shareholders when appropriate. We believe that we have access to multiple financing sources, including banks and the capital markets. We leveraged our strong relationships with our lenders under the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Sinosure Credit Facility to fund the construction and delivery of our VLCC newbuildings. We intend to manage our capital structure by actively monitoring our leverage level with changing market conditions and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate. For more information regarding our senior secured credit facilities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt Financings.”

 VESSEL ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
 Our practice is to acquire or dispose of secondhand vessels, newbuilding contracts, or shipping companies while focusing on maximizing shareholder value and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate. Our executive management team has a demonstrated track record in sourcing and executing acquisitions and disposals at attractive points in the cycle and financings. We are continuously and actively monitoring the market in an effort to take advantage of growth opportunities. We also evaluate opportunities to monetize our investments in vessels by selling them when conditions allow us to generate attractive returns, to adjust the profile of our fleet to fit customer demands such as preferences for modern vessels, and to generate capital for potential investments in the future.
 From 2001 to 2008, we grew from 20 vessels to 31 vessels upon the completion of our stock‑for‑stock acquisition of Arlington Tankers Ltd. in December 2008, our first acquisition of VLCCs.
 In 2010, we entered into agreements to purchase seven tankers for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $620 million, consisting of five VLCCs built between 2002 and 2010 and two Suezmax newbuildings, from subsidiaries of Metrostar Management Corporation. We completed taking delivery of these vessels in April 2011.
 In 2011, we sold three product tankers for aggregate net proceeds of $62 million and subsequently leased back each of these vessels to one of our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Chapter 11 plan, we rejected the bareboat charters and charter guarantees related to these leasebacks effective June 2012 and July 2012. In February 2011, we also sold one Aframax vessel and one Suezmax vessel. We sold one Aframax vessel in each of March 2011, April 2011, October 2011, May 2012 and October 2012.
 In 2014, we sold one Suezmax vessel, and we sold one Aframax vessel in each of February 2014 and October 2013. 
 In 2016, we sold one Suezmax vessel (the Gener8 Spyridon), two VLCC vessels (the Genmar Victory and Genmar Vision) and one Handymax (Gener8 Consul) vessel. 
 In 2017, we sold five VLCC vessels (the Gener8 Ulysses, Gener8 Zeus, Gener8 Theseus, Gener8 Noble and Gener8 Poseidon), four Suezmax vessels (the Gener8 Argus, Gener8 Horn, Gener8 Phoenix and Gener8 Orion) and three Aframax vessels (the Gener8 Pericles, Gener8 Elektra and Gener8 Daphne). For more information regarding our sale of the vessels, see Note 7, Delivery and Disposal of VESSELS, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
 Our fleet expansion strategy has involved two acquisitions of VLCC fleets in 2014 and 2015, described in more detail below. The VLCC fleet purchased in 2014 consists of seven “eco” newbuild VLCCs originally ordered by Scorpio Tankers, Inc. or “Scorpio.” These seven newbuildings were originally ordered by Scorpio and have an aggregate contract price of $662.2 million, and we acquired them for $735.0 million (with the difference from the contract price representing an additional embedded premium paid to Scorpio). We refer to the seven newbuildings acquired from Scorpio as the “2014 acquired VLCC newbuildings.” As of December 31, 2017, all of these vessels have been delivered to us and deployed in the VL8 pool. As of March 9, 2018, we have borrowed approximately $419.1 million under our senior secured credit facilities to fund the installment payments paid under the shipbuilding contracts for these vessels.
 Additionally, in 2015, we acquired 14 “eco” VLCCs newbuilding contracts through a merger with Navig8 Crude Tankers, Inc., which we refer to as “Navig8 Crude. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Related Party Transactions—2015 Merger Related Transactions” for more information regarding the merger with Navig8 Crude, which we refer to as the “2015 merger.” The 14 “eco” newbuild VLCCs we acquired in the 2015 merger had been originally ordered by Navig8 Crude prior to the 2015 merger with an aggregate contract price (including installment payments already made) of $1.3 billion. We assumed the remaining installment payments from Navig8 Crude. As of December 31, 2017, all of these VLCC vessels have been delivered to us and, other than two vessels (Gener8 Noble and Gener8 Theseus) which we sold in 2017, deployed in the VL8 Pool.

 As of March 9, 2018, we have borrowed approximately $772.8 million under our senior secured credit facilities to fund the installment payments paid under the shipbuilding contracts for these vessels. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Related Party Transactions – Related Party Transactions of Navig8 Crude Tankers, Inc.” for more information regarding our relationship with the Navig8 Group.
 These 21 VLCC vessels are based on advanced “eco” design, which incorporate many technological improvements such as more fuel‑efficient engines, hull forms, and propellers and decreased water resistance, designed to optimize speed and fuel consumption and reduce emissions. However, there is no guarantee of the extent to which these fuel efficiencies will be realized. See “Risk Factors–There is no assurance that our VLCC vessels will provide the fuel consumption savings that we expect, or that we will fully realize any fuel efficiency benefits of our VLCC vessels.”
 On December 20, 2017, Gener8 Neptune LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a memorandum of agreement for the sale of a 2015-built VLCC vessel known as the Gener8 Neptune to Euronav for a purchase price of $72.5 million (the “Neptune MoA”); Gener8 Athena LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a memorandum of agreement for the sale of a 2015-built VLCC vessel known as the Gener8 Athena to Euronav for a purchase price of $72.8 million (the “Athena MoA”); and Gener8 Hera LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a memorandum of agreement for the sale of a 2016-built VLCC vessel known as the Gener8 Hera to Euronav for a purchase price of $75.6 million (the “Hera MoA” and together with the Neptune MoA and Athena MoA, the “MoAs”). The rights and obligations of the parties under the MoAs for the sale and purchase of the vessels are conditioned on the Merger Agreement being terminated and each of the MoAs will be null and void in the event that the Merger is completed.

 OUR FLEET
 As of March 9, 2018 our fleet was comprised of 30 wholly-owned tankers, consisting of 21 VLCC vessels, six Suezmax vessels, one Aframax vessel and two Panamax vessels, with an aggregate carrying capacity of 7.5 million DWT. As of March 9, 2018, all of our VLCC vessels were deployed in Navig8 Group’s VL8 Pool and all of our Suezmax vessels were deployed in Navig8 Group’s Suez8 Pool.

      Pool = Vessel is chartered into a pool where it is deployed on the spot market (see below under the heading “—Fleet Deployment—Our Charters”).
 FLEET DEPLOYMENT
 We strive to optimize the financial performance of our fleet by opportunistically evaluating the deployment of our vessels in the spot market, which are contracts pertaining to specified cargo, and on time charters, which are contracts defined by their duration rather than their cargoes, including through commercial pool arrangements. Vessels operating in the spot market typically are chartered for a single voyage that may last up to three months whereas 

 
  13

 
vessels operating on time charters may be chartered for several months or years. Vessels operating in the spot market may generate increased profit margins during periods of improving tanker rates, while vessels operating on time charters generally provide more predictable cash flows. Due to the historically low charter rates in recent years, we have primarily deployed our vessels on spot market voyage charters (either directly or through pools which operate primarily in the spot market) as opposed to time charters. However, we actively monitor market conditions and changes in charter rates in managing the deployment of our vessels between spot market voyage charters, pool agreements and time charters. Historically, during certain periods of higher charter rates, we entered into time charters to benefit from a measure of stability through cycles. We may utilize a similar strategy to the extent that tanker rates rise and market conditions become favorable. We may also utilize time charters to lock in contracted rates when we believe the rate environment could weaken or decline in the future. We may also consider deploying our vessels on time charter for customers to use as floating storage. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Pool, Spot and Time Charter Deployment” for more information regarding our fleet deployment strategy. 
 Our Charters
 The following table details the percentage of our fleet operating on time charters, in the spot market and in the Navig8 pools during the prior three years.
 | Time Charter Vs. Spot Mix 
 | (as % of operating days) 
 | For the Years ended December 31,
 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 
Percentage in Navig8 pool days (1) | 94.3 | 91.2 | 39.4 
Percentage in time charter days | — | 1.8 | 9.4 
Percentage in spot charter days | 5.7 | 7.0 | 51.2 
Total vessel operating days | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0


 (1)     Consists of vessels chartered into the VL8 Pool, the Suez8 Pool and the V8 Pool.
 As of December 31, 2017, our fleet consisted of 30 vessels, which were all employed in the spot market (either directly or through spot market focused pools). 
 VL8 and V8 Pools
 We employ all of our VLCC and Suezmax vessels, in Navig8 Group commercial crude tanker pools, including the VL8 Pool and the Suez8 Pool, respectively. The pools leverage the Navig8 Group’s industry leading platform with a spot market focus, in which shipowners with vessels of similar size and quality participate along with us in the pools. As of December 31, 2017, based on information provided to us by the Navig8 Group, the VL8 Pool was comprised of 35 vessels and the Suez8 Pool was comprised of 16 vessels. 
 We believe this scale among global tanker pools will provide both us and these pools with freight optimization and cost benefits through economies of scale, as well as greater access to key market dynamics and information. Furthermore, we believe that vessel pools can provide cost‑effective commercial management activities for a group of similar class vessels and potentially result in lower waiting times. Pooling our vessels with those of other operators also helps us derive various operational benefits through voyage flexibility, including having more vessels available to deploy as opportunities arise. For example, pool participation means we could obtain backhaul or other voyages that could result in higher time charter equivalent earnings than we might have otherwise earned.
 For further detail on our pooling arrangements with the Navig8 Group, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions of Navig8 Crude Tankers Inc.”

 OPERATIONS AND SHIP MANAGEMENT
 Commercial Management
 Our management team and other employees, including the management and employees of our wholly‑owned subsidiary, Gener8 Maritime Management LLC, are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet. Commercial management involves negotiating charters for vessels, managing the mix of various types of charters, such as time charters, voyage charters and spot market‑related time charters, and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters. Strategic management involves locating, purchasing, financing and selling vessels. The commercial management of our vessels deployed in the VL8 and Suez8 Pools is handled by affiliates of the Navig8 Group. Our in‑house commercial management team oversees our pool arrangements and manages any vessels not chartered into pools. Technical Management
 We utilize the services of independent technical managers for the technical management of our fleet (including the vessels we have deployed in pools). We currently contract with Anglo Eastern Ship Management, Northern Marine Management, Wallem Ship Management and Selandia Ship Management, independent technical managers, for our technical management. Technical management involves the day‑to‑day management of vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations, arranging for crews and supplies and providing safety, quality and environmental management, operational support, crewing shipyard supervision, insurance and financial management services. Members of our New York City‑based corporate technical department oversee the activities of our independent technical managers. The head of our technical management team has over 39 years of experience in the shipping industry.
 Under our technical management agreements, our technical managers are obligated to:

· | provide qualified personnel to ensure safe vessel operation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | arrange and supervise the maintenance of our vessels to our standards to assure that our vessels comply with applicable national and international regulations and the requirements of our vessels’ classification societies including arranging and conducting vessel dry dockings;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | select and train the crews for our vessels, including assuring that the crews have the correct certificates for the types of vessels on which they serve;

 EMPLOYEES
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed 39 office personnel. Fourteen of these employees (of which thirteen are located in New York City and one is located in Houston, Texas) manage the commercial operations of our business and oversee the technical management of our fleet. As part of our strategy to outsource the technical management of our fleet, we completed the closure of our Portugal office (which had four employees) in August 2015 and our Russia office (which had three employees) in March 2016. 
 Since November 15, 2014, we no longer provided any seaborne personnel to crew our vessels. Crews for our vessels are provided by third‑party managers. Our technical managers are responsible for locating and retaining qualified officers for our vessels subject to third‑party management arrangements. The technical managers handle each seaman’s training, travel and payroll, and ensure that all the seamen on our vessels have the qualifications and licenses required to comply with international regulations and shipping conventions. We typically man our vessels with more crew members than are required by the country of the vessel’s flag in order to allow for the performance of routine maintenance duties.
 We place great emphasis on attracting qualified crew members for employment on our vessels. Recruiting qualified senior officers has become an increasingly difficult task for vessel operators. We believe that our third‑party technical managers pay competitive salaries and provide competitive benefits to our personnel. We believe that the well‑maintained quarters and equipment on our vessels help to attract and retain motivated and qualified seamen and officers. Our crew management services contractors have collective bargaining agreements that cover all the junior officers and seamen whom they provide to us.
 CUSTOMERS
 We have strong relationships with our customers, which include major international oil companies and commodities trading firms such as Saudi Aramco, BP, Shell, S‑Oil, Exxon, Chevron, Repsol, Valero, Reliance, Petrobras and Clearlake, either directly or through pooling arrangements.
 Our vessels are primarily available for employment in commercial pools, or for charter on a spot voyage or time charter basis. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Navig8 pools accounted for 95.2%, 91.2% and 34.8%, respectively of our net voyage revenues. The Navig8 pools, which manage vessels owned by third-party operators, distribute revenues on net basis, and our net voyage revenues are not directly attributable to the charterers of our vessels. We receive such revenues indirectly through distributions made to us by the Navig8 pools in which our vessels participate. See “Risk Factors—We receive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers and pools, and the loss of any customer or the termination of our relationships with these pools could result in a significant loss of revenues and cash flow” for certain risks related to our reliance on key customers. 
 COMPETITION
 International seaborne transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products is provided by two main types of operators: fleets owned by independent companies and fleets operated by oil companies (both private and state‑owned). Many oil companies and other oil trading companies, the primary charterers of the vessels we own, also operate their own vessels and transport oil for themselves and third‑party charterers in direct competition with independent owners and operators. Competition for charters is intense and is based upon price, vessel location, the size, age, condition and acceptability of the vessel, and the quality and reputation of the vessel’s operator.
 Other significant operators of vessels carrying crude oil and other petroleum products include Frontline, Ltd., Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., Teekay Shipping Corporation, Tsakos Energy Navigation, Euronav, DHT Holdings, Inc., and Tankers International LLC. There are also numerous, smaller vessel operators.
 See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain negative factors pertaining to our competitive position.

 INSURANCE    General Operational Risks 
 The operation of any ocean‑going vessel carries an inherent risk of catastrophic marine disasters and property losses caused by adverse weather conditions, mechanical failures, human error, war, terrorism and other circumstances or events. In addition, the transportation of crude oil is subject to the risk of spills, and business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes and boycotts. The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or “OPA,” has made liability insurance more expensive for ship owners and operators imposing potentially unlimited liability upon owners, operators and bareboat charterers for oil pollution incidents in the territorial waters of the United States. We believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to protect us against the principal accident‑related risks that we face in the conduct of our business.
 Liability Risks: Protection and Indemnity Insurance    Our protection and indemnity insurance, or “P&I insurance,” covers, subject to customary deductibles, policy limits and extensions, third‑party liabilities and other related expenses from, among other things, injury or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, claims arising from collisions, damage to cargo and other third‑party property and pollution arising from oil or other substances. Our current P&I insurance coverage for pollution is the maximum commercially available amount of $1.0 billion per tanker per incident and is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations. Our current P&I Insurance coverage for non‑pollution losses is $3.0 billion per tanker per incident. Each of the vessels currently in our fleet is entered in a protection and indemnity association which is a member of the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Mutual Assurance Associations, or the “International Group.” The 13 protection and indemnity associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association’s liabilities. Each protection and indemnity association has capped its exposure to this pooling agreement at $4.3 billion. As a member of protection and indemnity associations, which are, in turn, members of the International Group, we are subject to calls payable to the associations based on the International Group’s claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual associations and members of the pool of protection and indemnity associations comprising the International Group.
 Marine Risks: Hull and Machinery and War Risks    Our hull and machinery insurance covers actual or constructive total loss from covered risks of collision, fire, heavy weather, grounding and engine failure or damages from same. Our war risk insurance covers risks of confiscation, seizure, capture, vandalism, sabotage and other war‑related risks. Such coverage is subject to policy deductibles. Our loss‑of‑hire insurance covers loss of revenue for up to 90 days resulting from vessel off hire for each of our vessels, with a 14‑day deductible.
 ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND OTHER REGULATIONS    Government regulation and laws significantly affect the ownership and operation of our fleet. We are subject to international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which our vessels may operate or are registered relating to safety, health and environmental protection including the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, the remediation of contamination and liability for damage to natural resources. Compliance with such laws, regulations and other requirements entails significant expense, including vessel modifications and implementation of certain operating procedures.
 A variety of government and private entities subject our vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include the local port authorities (applicable national authorities such as the United States Coast Guard (“USCG”), harbor master or equivalent), classification societies, flag state administrations (countries of registry) and charterers, particularly terminal operators. Certain of these entities require us to obtain permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations for the operation of our vessels. Failure to maintain necessary permits or approvals 

 
  17

 
could require us to incur substantial costs or result in the temporary suspension of the operation of one or more of our vessels.
 We believe that the heightened level of environmental and quality concerns among insurance underwriters, regulators and charterers is leading to greater inspection and safety requirements on all vessels and may accelerate the scrapping of older vessels throughout the industry. Increasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to stricter environmental standards. We are required to maintain operating standards for all of our vessels that emphasize operational safety, quality maintenance, continuous training of our officers and crews and compliance with United States and international regulations. We believe that the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our vessels have all material permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. However, because such laws and regulations are frequently changed and may impose increasingly stricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements, nor the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. In addition, a future serious marine incident that causes significant adverse environmental impact could result in additional legislation or regulation that could negatively affect our profitability.
 It should be noted that the U.S. is currently experiencing changes in its environmental policy, the results of which have yet to be fully determined. For example, in April 2017, President Trump signed an executive order regarding environmental regulations, specifically targeting the U.S. offshore energy strategy, which may affect parts of the maritime industry and our operations. Furthermore, recent action by the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee and United States agencies indicate that cybersecurity regulations for the maritime industry are likely to be further developed in the near future in an attempt to combat cybersecurity threats. For example, cyber-risk management systems must be incorporated by ship-owners and managers by 2021. This might cause companies to cultivate additional procedures for monitoring cybersecurity, which could require additional expenses and/or capital expenditures. However, the impact of such regulations is hard to predict at this time.
 International Maritime Organization (IMO)
 The International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of pollution by vessels (the “IMO”), has adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, collectively referred to as MARPOL 73/78 and herein as “MARPOL,” the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974 (“SOLAS Convention”) and the International Convention on Load Lines of 1966. MARPOL establishes environmental standards relating to oil leakage or spilling, garbage management, sewage, air emissions, handling and disposal of noxious liquids and the handling of harmful substances in packaged forms. MARPOL is applicable to drybulk, tanker and LPG carriers, among other vessels, and is broken into six Annexes, each of which regulates a different source of pollution. Annex I relates to oil leakage or spilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried in bulk in liquid or in packaged form, respectively; Annexes IV and V relate to sewage and garbage management, respectively; and Annex VI relates to air emissions. Annex VI was separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997. 
 In 2013, the MEPC adopted a resolution amending MARPOL Annex I Condition Assessment Scheme, or “CAS.” These amendments became effective on October 1, 2014, and require compliance with the 2011 International Code on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers, or “ESP Code,” which provides for enhanced inspection programs.    Air Emissions    In September of 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air pollution from vessels. Effective May 2005, Annex VI sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from all commercial vessel exhausts and prohibits “deliberate emissions” of ozone depleting substances (such as halons and chlorofluorocarbons), emissions of volatile compounds from cargo tanks, and the shipboard incineration of specific substances. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions, as explained below. Emissions of “volatile organic compounds” from certain tankers, and the shipboard incineration (from incinerators installed after January 1, 2000) of certain substances (such as 

 
  18

 
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs) are also prohibited. We believe that all our vessels are currently compliant in all material respects with these regulations.
 The IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee (“MEPC”) adopted amendments to Annex VI regarding emissions of sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and ozone depleting substances, which entered into force on July 1, 2010. The amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution by, among other things, implementing a progressive reduction of the amount of sulfur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships. On October 27, 2016, at its 70th session, the MEPC agreed to implement a global 0.5% m/m sulfur oxide emissions limit (reduced from the current 3.50%) starting from January 1, 2020. This limitation can be met by using low-sulfur compliant fuel oil, alternative fuels, or certain exhaust gas cleaning systems. Once the cap becomes effective, ships will be required to obtain bunker delivery notes and International Air Pollution Prevention (“IAPP”) Certificates from their flag states that specify sulfur content. This subjects ocean-going vessels in these areas to stringent emissions controls, and may cause us to incur additional costs.
 Sulfur content standards are even stricter within certain “Emission Control Areas,” or “ECAs.” As of January 1, 2015, ships operating within an ECA were not permitted to use fuel with sulfur content in excess of 0.1%. Amended Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs. Currently, the IMO has designated four ECAs, including specified portions of the Baltic Sea area, North Sea area, North American area and United States Caribbean area. Ocean-going vessels in these areas are subject to stringent emission controls and may cause us to incur additional costs. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO, or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or the states where we operate, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures or otherwise increase the costs of our operations.
 Amended Annex VI also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for marine diesel engines, depending on their date of installation. At the MEPC meeting held from March to April 2014, amendments to Annex VI were adopted which address the date on which Tier III Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) standards in ECAs will go into effect. Under the amendments, Tier III NOx standards apply to ships that operate in the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECAs designed for the control of NOx with a marine diesel engine installed and constructed on or after January 1, 2016. Tier III requirements could apply to areas that will be designated for Tier III NOx in the future. At MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, the MEPC approved the North Sea and Baltic Sea as ECAs for nitrogen oxide for ships built after January 1, 2021. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promulgated equivalent (and in some senses stricter) emissions standards in late 2009. As a result of these designations or similar future designations, we may be required to incur additional operating or other costs.
 As determined at the MEPC 70, the new Regulation 22A of MARPOL Annex VI is effective as of March 1, 2018 and requires ships above 5,000 gross tonnage to collect and report annual data on fuel oil consumption to an IMO database, with the first year of data collection commencing on January 1, 2019.
 As of January 1, 2013, MARPOL made mandatory certain measures relating to energy efficiency for ships. All ships are now required to develop and implement Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans (“SEEMPS”), and new ships must be designed in compliance with minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile as defined by the Energy Efficiency Design Index. Under these measures, by 2025, all new ships built will be 30% more energy efficient than those built in 2014.
 We may incur costs to comply with these revised standards. Additional or new conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could require the installation of expensive emission control systems and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
 Safety Management System Requirements
 The SOLAS Convention was amended to address the safe manning of vessels and emergency training drills. The Convention of Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (the “LLMC”) sets limitations of liability for a loss of 

 
  19

 
life or personal injury claim or a property claim against ship owners. We believe that all of our vessels are in substantial compliance with SOLAS and LL Convention standards.
 Under Chapter IX of the SOLAS Convention, or the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (the “ISM Code”), our operations are also subject to environmental standards and requirements. The ISM Code requires the party with operational control of a vessel to develop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. Our technical managers are in compliance with the ISM Code. The failure of a vessel owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. 
 The ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel’s management with the ISM Code requirements for a safety management system. No vessel can obtain a safety management certificate unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance, issued by each flag state, under the ISM Code. Our vessels and technical managers are in compliance with these requirements. 
 Amendments to the SOLAS Convention Chapter VII apply to vessels transporting dangerous goods and require those vessels be in compliance with the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (“IMDG Code”). Starting in January 1, 2018, the IMDG Code includes (1) updates to the provisions for radioactive material, reflecting the latest provisions from the International Atomic Energy Agency, (2) new marking, packing and classification requirements for dangerous goods, and (3) new mandatory training requirements.
 The IMO has also adopted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (“STCW”). As of February 2017, all seafarers are required to meet the STCW standards and be in possession of a valid STCW certificate. Flag states that have ratified SOLAS and STCW generally employ the classification societies, which have incorporated SOLAS and STCW requirements into their class rules, to undertake surveys to confirm compliance.
 Pollution Control and Liability Requirements 
 The IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatories to such conventions. For example, the IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (the “BWM Convention”) in 2004. The BWM Convention entered into force on September 9, 2017. The BWM Convention requires ships to manage their ballast water to remove, render harmless, or avoid the uptake or discharge of new or invasive aquatic organisms and pathogens within ballast water and sediments. The BWM Convention’s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits, and require all ships to carry a ballast water record book and an international ballast Water management certificate.  
 On December 4, 2013, the IMO Assembly passed a resolution revising the application dates of BWM Convention so that the dates are triggered by the entry into force date and not the dates originally in the BWM Convention. This, in effect, makes all vessels delivered before the entry into force date “existing vessels” and allows for the installation of ballast water management systems on such vessels at the first International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) renewal survey following entry into force of the convention. The MEPC adopted updated guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems (G8) at MEPC 70. At MEPC 71, the schedule regarding the BWM Convention’s implementation dates was also discussed and amendments were introduced to extend the date existing vessels are subject to certain ballast water standards. Ships over 400 gross tons generally must comply with a “D-1 standard,” requiring the exchange of ballast water only in open seas and away from coastal waters. The “D-2 standard” specifies the maximum amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged, and compliance dates vary depending on the IOPP renewal dates. Depending on the date of the IOPP renewal survey, existing vessels must comply with the D2 

 
  20

 
standard on or after September 8, 2019. For most ships, compliance with the D2 standard will involve installing on-board systems to treat ballast water and eliminate unwanted organisms. Costs of compliance may be substantial.
 Once mid-ocean ballast exchange ballast water treatment requirements become mandatory under the BWM Convention, the cost compliance could increase for ocean carriers and may be material. However, many countries already regulate the discharge of ballast water carried by vessels from country to country to prevent the introduction of invasive and harmful species via such discharges. The U.S., for example, requires vessels entering its waters from another country to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange, or undertake some alternate measure, and to comply with certain reporting requirements. The costs of compliance with a mandatory mid-ocean ballast exchange could be material, and it is difficult to predict the overall impact of such a requirement on our operations.
 The IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, as amended by different Protocols in 1976, 1984, and 1992, and amended in 2000 (the “CLC”). Under the CLC and depending on whether the country in which the damage results is a party to the 1992 Protocol to the CLC, a vessel’s registered owner may be strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain exceptions. The 1992 Protocol changed certain limits on liability expressed using the International Monetary Fund currency unit, the Special Drawing Rights. The limits on liability have since been amended so that the compensation limits on liability were raised. The right to limit liability is forfeited under the CLC where the spill is caused by the shipowner’s actual fault and under the 1992 Protocol where the spill is caused by the shipowner’s intentional or reckless act or omission where the shipowner knew pollution damage would probably result. The CLC requires ships over 2,000 tons covered by it to maintain insurance covering the liability of the owner in a sum equivalent to an owner’s liability for a single incident. We believe that our protection and indemnity insurance will cover the liability under the plan adopted by the IMO.
 The IMO also adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (the “Bunker Convention”) to impose strict liability on ship owners for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel. The Bunker Convention requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the LLMC). With respect to non-ratifying states, liability for spills or releases of oil carried as fuel in ship’s bunkers typically is determined by the national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur.
 Anti‑Fouling Requirements    In 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti‑fouling Systems on Ships, or the “Anti‑fouling Convention.” The Anti‑fouling Convention, which entered into force on September 17, 2008, prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks and other sea life to the hulls of vessels. Vessels of over 400 gross tons engaged in international voyages will also be required to undergo an initial survey before the vessel is put into service or before an International Anti‑fouling System Certificate is issued for the first time; and subsequent surveys when the anti‑fouling systems are altered or replaced. We have obtained Anti‑fouling System Certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the Anti‑fouling Convention.
 Compliance Enforcement
 Noncompliance with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject the ship owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. The USCG and European Union authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code by the applicable deadlines will be prohibited from trading in U.S. and European Union ports, respectively. As of the date of this report, each of our vessels is ISM Code certified. However, there can be no assurance that such certificates will be maintained in the future. The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulations might have on our operations.

 United States Regulations
 The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.
 The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. OPA affects all “owners and operators” whose vessels trade or operate with the U.S., its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in U.S. waters, which includes the U.S.’s territorial sea and its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the U.S. The U.S. has also enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil, except in limited circumstances, whether on land or at sea. OPA and CERCLA both define “owner and operator” in the case of a vessel as any person owning, operating or chartering by demise, the vessel. Both OPA and CERCLA impact our operations.
 Under OPA, vessel owners and operators are “responsible parties” and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels, including bunkers (fuel). OPA defines these other damages broadly to include:
 (i)      injury to, destruction or loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources and related assessment costs;
 (ii)       injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property;
 (iii)      loss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured, destroyed or lost;
 (iv)      net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property, or natural resources;
 (v)       lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; and
 (vi)      net cost of increased or additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil, such as protection from fire, safety or health hazards, and loss of subsistence use of natural resources.
 OPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages; such caps do not apply to direct cleanup costs. Effective December 21, 2015, for a tank vessel, other than a single-hull tank vessel, over 3,000 gross tons liability is limited to the greater of $2,200 per gross ton or $18,796,800. These limits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a responsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship), or a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The limitation on liability similarly does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to (i) report the incident where the responsibility party knows or has reason to know of the incident; (ii) reasonably cooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities; or (iii) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under the Federal Water Pollution Act (Section 311 (c), (e)) or the Intervention on the High Seas Act.
 CERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for cleanup, removal and remedial costs, as well as damages for injury to, or destruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing same, and health assessments or health effects studies. There is no liability if the discharge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5.0 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross ton or $500,000 for any other vessel. These limits do not apply (rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or negligence, or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations. The limitation on liability also 

 
  22

 
does not apply if the responsible person fails or refused to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA.
 OPA and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law. OPA and CERCLA both require owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject. Vessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing a proof of insurance, a surety bond, qualification as a self-insurer or a guarantee. We plan to comply with the USCG’s financial responsibility regulations by providing a certificate of responsibility evidencing sufficient self-insurance.
 The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has resulted in additional regulatory initiatives or statutes, including the raising of liability caps under OPA, new regulations regarding offshore oil and gas drilling, and a pilot inspection program for offshore facilities. However, the status of several of these initiatives and regulations is currently in flux. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) announced a new Well Control Rule in April 2016, but pursuant to orders by President Trump in early 2017, the BSEE announced in August 2017 that this rule would be revised. In January 2018, President Trump proposed leasing new sections of U.S. waters to oil and gas companies for offshore drilling, vastly expanding the U.S. waters that are available for such activity over the next five years. The effects of the proposal are currently unknown. Compliance with any new requirements of OPA may substantially impact our cost of operations or require us to incur additional expenses to comply with any new regulatory initiatives or statutes. Additional legislation or regulations applicable to the operation of our vessels that may be implemented in the future could adversely affect our business. 
 OPA specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, provided they accept, at a minimum, the levels of liability established under OPA and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills. Many U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law. Moreover, some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters, although in some cases, states which have enacted this type of legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining tanker owners’ responsibilities under these laws. The Company intends to comply with all applicable state regulations in the ports where the Company’s vessels call.
 We currently maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of $1 billion per incident for each of our vessels. If the damages from a catastrophic spill were to exceed our insurance coverage it could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.
 Other United States Environmental Regulations
 The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970 (including its amendments of 1977 and 1990) (“CAA”) requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. Our vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas. The CAA also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans, or SIPs, designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in each state. Although state-specific, SIPs may include regulations concerning emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. Our vessels operating in covered port areas with restricted cargoes are equipped with vapor recovery systems that satisfy these existing requirements.
 The U.S. Clean Water Act (“CWA”) prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly-issued permit or exemption and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA. 

 
  23

 

 The EPA and the USCG have also enacted rules relating to ballast water discharge, compliance with which requires the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial costs, and/or may otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. Waters. The EPA requires a permit regulating ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain vessels within United States waters under the Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of Vessels (the “VGP”). On March 28, 2013, the EPA re-issued the VGP for another five years from the effective date of December 19, 2013. The 2013 VGP focuses on authorizing discharges incidental to operations of commercial vessels, and contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in U.S. waters, stringent requirements for exhaust gas scrubbers, and requirements for the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants. For a new vessel delivered to an owner or operator after December 19, 2013 to be covered by the VGP, the owner must submit a Notice of Intent (“NOI”) at least 30 days (or 7 days for eNOIs) before the vessel operates in United States waters. Our technical managers have submitted NOIs for our vessels where required.
 The USCG regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act (“NISA”) impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering or operating in U.S. waters, which require the installation of certain engineering equipment and water treatment systems to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures, and/or may otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. waters. The USCG has implemented revised regulations on ballast water management by establishing standards on the allowable concentration of living organisms in ballast water discharged from ships in U.S. waters. As of January 1, 2014, vessels were technically subject to the phasing-in of these standards, and the USCG must approve any technology before it is placed on a vessel. The USCG first approved said technology in December 2016, and continues to review ballast water management systems. The USCG may also provide waivers to vessels that demonstrate why they cannot install the new technology. The USCG has set up requirements for ships constructed before December 1, 2013 with ballast tanks trading with exclusive economic zones of the U.S. to install water ballast treatment systems as follows: (1) ballast capacity 1,500-5,000m3—first scheduled drydock after January 1, 2014; and (2) ballast capacity above 5,000m3—first scheduled drydock after January 1, 2016. All of our vessels have ballast capacities over 5,000m3, and those of our vessels trading in the U.S. will have to install water ballast treatment plants at their first drydock after January 1, 2016, unless an extension is granted by the USCG.
 The EPA, on the other hand, has taken a different approach to enforcing ballast discharge standards under the VGP. On December 27, 2013, the EPA issued an enforcement response policy in connection with the new VGP in which the EPA indicated that it would take into account the reasons why vessels do not have the requisite technology installed, but will not grant any waivers. In addition, through the CWA certification provisions that allow U.S. states to place additional conditions on the use of the VGP within state waters, a number of states have proposed or implemented a variety of stricter ballast requirements including, in some states, specific treatment standards. Compliance with the EPA, USCG and state regulations could require the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial cost, or may otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. waters. 
 Two recent United States court decisions should be noted. First, in October 2015, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that directed the EPA to redraft the sections of the 2013 VGP that address ballast water. However, the Second Circuit stated that 2013 VGP will remain in effect until the EPA issues a new VGP. The effect of such redrafting remains unknown. Second, on October 9, 2015, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the Waters of the United States rule (WOTUS), which aimed to expand the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States,” pending further action of the court. In response, regulations have continued to be implemented as they were prior to the stay on a case-by-case basis. In February 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to publish a proposed rule rescinding or revising the WOTUS rule. In January 2018, the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers issued a final rule pursuant to President Trump’s order, under which the Agencies will interpret the term “waters of the United States” to mean waters covered by the regulations, as they are currently being implemented, within the context of the Supreme Court decisions and agency guidance documents, until February 6, 2020. Litigation regarding the status of the WOTUS rule is currently underway, and the effect of future actions in these cases upon our operations is unknown.

 European Union Regulations
 In October 2009, the European Union amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship‑source discharges of polluting substances, including minor discharges, if committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. Member States were required to enact laws or regulations to comply with the directive by the end of 2010. Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims.
 The European Union has adopted several regulations and directives requiring, among other things, more frequent inspections of high‑risk ships, as determined by type, age, and flag as well as the number of times the ship has been detained. The European Union also adopted and then extended a ban on substandard ships and enacted a minimum ban period and a definitive ban for repeated offenses. The regulation also provided the European Union with greater authority and control over classification societies, by imposing more requirements on classification societies and providing for fines or penalty payments for organizations that failed to comply.
 International Labour Organization
 The International Labour Organization (the “ILO”) is a specialized agency of the UN that has adopted the Maritime Labor Convention 2006 (“MLC 2006”). A Maritime Labor Certificate and a Declaration of Maritime Labor Compliance is required to ensure compliance with the MLC 2006 for all ships above 500 gross tons in international trade. All our vessels are in compliance with and are certified to meet MLC 2006. Greenhouse Gas Regulation
 Currently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with targets extended through 2020. International negotiations are continuing with respect to a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, and restrictions on shipping emissions may be included in any new treaty. In December 2009, more than 27 nations, including the U.S. and China, signed the Copenhagen Accord, which includes a non-binding commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016 and does not directly limit greenhouse gas emissions from ships. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. The timing and effect of such action has yet to be determined.
 At MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, a draft outline of the structure of the initial strategy for developing a comprehensive IMO strategy on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships was approved. In accordance with this roadmap, an initial IMO strategy for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is expected to be adopted at MEPC 72 in April 2018. The IMO may implement market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships at the upcoming MEPC session. 
 The EU made a unilateral commitment to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from its member states from 20% of 1990 levels by 2020. The EU also committed to reduce its emissions by 20% under the Kyoto Protocol’s second period from 2013 to 2020. Starting in January 2018, large ships calling at EU ports are required to collect and publish data on carbon dioxide emissions and other information.
 In the United States, the EPA issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety, adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources, and proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from large stationary sources. However, in March 2017, President Trump signed an executive order to review and possibly eliminate the EPA’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome of this order is not yet known. Although the mobile source emissions regulations do not apply to greenhouse gas emissions from vessels, the EPA or individual U.S. states could enact environmental regulations that would affect our operations. 

 
  25

 
For example, California has introduced a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas emissions, aiming to reduce emissions 40% by 2030.
 Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, the EU, the U.S. or other countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto Protocol or Paris Agreement, that restricts emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial expenditures which we cannot predict with certainty at this time. Even in the absence of climate control legislation, our business may be indirectly affected to the extent that climate change may result in sea level changes or more intense weather events.
 Vessel Security Regulations
 Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security such as the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”). To implement certain portions of the MTSA, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and at certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the EPA.
 Similarly, Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS Convention imposes detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities and mandates compliance with the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code (“the ISPS Code”). The ISPS Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel’s flag state. Ships operating without a valid certificate may be detained, expelled from, or refused entry at port until they obtain an ISSC. The following are among the various requirements, some of which are found in the SOLAS Convention:

· | on-board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety-related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including information on a ship’s identity, position, course, speed and navigational status;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | on-board installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the development of vessel security plans;
--+------------------------------------------


· | ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel’s hull;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel’s history including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship’s identification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with flag state security certification requirements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

  The USCG regulations, intended to be aligned with international maritime security standards, exempt non-U.S. vessels from MTSA vessel security measures, provided such vessels have on board a valid ISSC that attests to the vessel’s compliance with the SOLAS Convention security requirements and the ISPS Code. Future security measures could have a significant financial impact on us. We intend to comply with the various security measures addressed by MTSA, the SOLAS Convention and the ISPS Code.

 Inspection by Classification Societies
 The hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and SOLAS. Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage and lending that a vessel be certified “in class” by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies, the IACS. The IACS has adopted harmonized Common Structural Rules, or the Rules, which apply to oil tankers and bulk carriers constructed on or after July 1, 2015. The Rules attempt to create a level of consistency between IACS Societies. All of our vessels are certified as being "in class" by all the major Classification Societies (e.g., American Bureau of Shipping, DNV GL).
 A vessel must undergo annual surveys, intermediate surveys, drydockings and special surveys. In lieu of a special survey, a vessel’s machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Every vessel is also required to be drydocked every 30 to 36 months for inspection of the underwater parts of the vessel. If any vessel does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey, drydocking or special survey, the vessel will be unable to carry cargo between ports and will be unemployable and uninsurable which could cause us to be in violation of certain covenants in our loan agreements. Any such inability to carry cargo or be employed, or any such violation of covenants, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
 Oil Major Vetting Process 
 Shipping in general and crude tankers in particular, have been, and will remain, heavily regulated. Many international and national rules, regulations and other requirements—whether imposed by the classification societies, international statutes, national and local administrations or industry—must be complied with in order to enable a shipping company to operate and a vessel to trade.
 Traditionally there have been relatively few large players in the oil trading business and the industry is continuously consolidating. The so‑called “oil majors,” such as BP, Chevron, Conoco Phillips, Exxon, Petrobras, Shell, Sinopec, Statoil and Total, together with a few smaller companies, represent a significant percentage of the production, trading and, especially, shipping logistics (terminals) of crude and refined products worldwide. Concerns for the environment, health and safety have led the oil majors to develop and implement a strict due diligence process when selecting their commercial partners. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel operator and the vessel.
 While many parameters are considered and evaluated prior to a commercial decision, the oil majors, through their association, the Oil Companies International Marine Forum, or “OCIMF,” have developed and are implementing two basic tools: (a) SIRE, the Ship Inspection Report Program, and (b) the Tanker Management & Self Assessment, or “TMSA” program. The former is a physical ship inspection protocol based upon a thorough vessel inspection questionnaire, and performed by accredited OCIMF inspectors, resulting in a report being logged on SIRE, while the latter is a recent addition to the risk assessment tools used by the oil majors.
 Based upon commercial needs, there are three levels of risk assessment used by the oil majors: (a) terminal use, which will clear a vessel to call at one of the oil major’s terminals; (b) voyage charter, which will clear the vessel for a single voyage; and (c) term charter, which will clear the vessel for use for an extended period of time. The depth, complexity and difficulty of each of these levels of assessment vary. While for the terminal use and voyage charter relationships a ship inspection and the operator’s TMSA will be sufficient, a longer term charter relationship also requires a thorough office assessment. In addition to the commercial interest on the part of the oil major, an excellent safety and environmental protection record is necessary to ensure an office assessment is undertaken.
 We believe that we benefit from our technical managers’ track record of successful audits by major international oil companies. See “—Operations and Ship Management—Technical Management” for more information about our technical managers.

 SEASONALITY
 We operate our vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in tanker demand and, as a result, in charter rates. Tanker markets are typically stronger in the fall and winter months (the fourth and first quarters of the calendar year) in anticipation of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter months. Unpredictable weather patterns and variations in oil reserves disrupt vessel scheduling and could adversely impact charter rates.
