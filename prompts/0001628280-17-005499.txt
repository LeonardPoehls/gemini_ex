The Confluence of IT Trends Creates a Set of Obstacles that IT Professionals Must Address
IT trends are significantly changing the way that IT infrastructures are designed, deployed and secured, creating a complex and rapidly evolving set of challenges that need to be addressed by IT professionals. This complexity influences the way organizations design and deploy their networks and applications, including leveraging public cloud, SaaS and managed services solutions. 

• | Escalating Security Threat Environment. Organizations face increasingly sophisticated and targeted security threats from a variety of attackers, including state-sponsored, profit-motivated, automated and internal attackers. These attacks can result in organizational disruption, as well as the theft of sensitive information such as credit card information, and can cause financial and reputational damage. These threats are exacerbated further as customers migrate their applications to public and private clouds. Organizations of all sizes are being forced to reexamine their security risks and technology investments as threats evolve and increase in number, complexity, variety and severity.


• | Productivity and Security Challenges Posed by Cloud Services and Web Applications. Organizations can benefit greatly from popular web applications, which enable new channels to communicate and collaborate with customers and business partners, as well as a means to market their products and recruit employees. While many of these applications can benefit the business, they can introduce significant security vulnerabilities as well as inappropriate and unproductive activities in the workplace. Organizations need to safely enable the use of these applications, such that only the right individuals are using the right set of applications for their business functions.


• | Explosion of Data and Increased Storage Consumption. Organizations and employees are increasingly dependent on the availability of information. As a result, organizations cannot afford to lose access to business-critical data and need a cost effective and scalable way to ensure that their data is being stored safely and can be recovered rapidly.


• | Constrained IT Budgets. Macroeconomic conditions have kept IT budgets under significant pressure, and despite recent innovations in the industry, security and data protection infrastructures increasingly require greater investments to implement, run and manage. As a result, there is a need for security and data protection environments to become vastly more efficient. Further, many small- and mid-sized organizations are turning to managed service providers to implement these technology solutions on a "pay-as-you-go" basis with minimal upfront costs.

Organizations Need a New Approach to IT in Resource-Constrained Environments
Rapidly changing dynamics in today’s IT landscape are forcing organizations of all sizes to evolve their IT strategies. Fortune 500 companies are better positioned to address these challenges as they typically have core IT departments that can comprise a significant number of highly skilled and specialized computer scientists and engineers, as well as IT budgets that can be in the billions of dollars. We believe that there are millions of underserved organizations without these resources. These organizations include small- and mid-market businesses, governments, educational institutions and departments or divisions within Fortune 2000 enterprises. IT professionals within these organizations seek powerful yet easy-to-use solutions to address the challenges posed by these trends.
We believe most traditional software and hardware vendors have designed their products and business operations to cater primarily to larger companies. These solutions typically fail to meet the needs of more resource-constrained organizations in several key ways:

• | Complex to Deploy and Use. Traditional IT solutions often are difficult to install, require significant configuration and necessitate specialized services and technical support to get the systems up and running. These solutions often take months to implement and require highly trained IT staff to manage and maintain. Moreover, traditional IT solutions often provide a wide variety of features that meet the specific needs of the largest, most sophisticated customers but are of little-to-no use to the vast majority of customers.


• | Marketing Optimized for Large Organizations. Traditional IT solution vendors tend to focus marketing efforts primarily on high-touch, senior level interactions with a smaller number of large customers. As a result, IT professionals within resource-constrained organizations are frequently challenged to work effectively with these vendors to discern the products they require to solve their problems.


• | Lengthy, High-Touch Sales Cycle. Because of the complexity and expense related to the purchase of traditional IT solutions, traditional vendors usually use high-touch direct sales models, typically to larger customers, in order to sell their products. As a result, the complexity of traditional IT solutions and the requirement for customers to tailor traditional IT solutions to their needs lead to longer sales cycles, prolonging the period of time before customers can solve their problems. These sales-related expenses typically are passed on to their customers through product prices.

4


• | Lengthy Manufacturing and Fulfillment. Solutions from traditional IT vendors often have long delivery and installation times. In addition, vendors periodically experience delivery delays due to the inability of their supply chain to meet quality and delivery requirements consistently. The risk of these delays can be greater where custom or semi-custom components and configurations are involved. Due to their size, traditional IT solution vendors also need to manage a high degree of operational complexity and spend a significant amount of effort rationalizing these processes to improve their profitability, manage inventory and better match demand and supply. These factors result in additional costs, which traditional vendors may pass on to their customers through product prices.


• | Unsatisfactory Customer Support. Traditional IT solution vendors often rely heavily on self-service telephone support and outsourced customer support located in remote geographies. This approach can lead to an unsatisfactory and frustrating customer support experience and lengthy time to resolution.

The Barracuda Web Security Gateway (formerly Barracuda Web Filter) integrates several technologies, including Advanced Threat Protection, for setting and enforcing granular web filtering policies to protect users from rapidly evolving web-based threats and to increase productivity and optimize bandwidth. The Barracuda Web Security Gateway blocks user access to known malicious websites, scans web downloads for malware, enables granular enforcement based on existing user and group authentication and provides comprehensive web usage visibility through intuitive dashboards. The cloud-based Barracuda Web Security Service is designed to deliver web security and policy enforcement in highly distributed network environments.
Application Delivery Controllers. The Barracuda Load Balancer ADC is an integrated platform that distributes network traffic across multiple servers using advanced Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing techniques or even across multiple data centers using global server load balancing, content caching, data compression and connection pooling to offload computing functions from backend servers and improve application response time. Advanced features for application optimization and integrated security are designed to protect customers from malicious data, application-layer attacks and DDoS attacks before they reach internal servers.
Data Protection
Our data protection solutions provide a portfolio of solutions for on-premises and cloud-based archiving and backup.
Backup. Barracuda Backup is an end-to-end solution for protecting physical, virtual and SaaS-based environments. Barracuda Backup enables secure offsite replication to other Barracuda Backup appliances and to the Barracuda storage cloud. Barracuda Backup uses advanced deduplication technology to reduce the amount of backup data stored. Our LiveBoot and Cloud LiveBoot technology enables quick disaster recovery for virtual servers by running them directly from the backup appliance or the Barracuda cloud, without the overhead associated with restoring backup images to their original format.
Archiving. Barracuda Cloud Archiving provides cloud-based archiving. The service is designed for organizations using on-premises Microsoft Exchange, Office 365 or hybrid combinations, and helps ensure email is stored securely in a separate repository for as long as needed without risk of tampering or deletion. The Barracuda Message Archiver is available as a physical or virtual appliance on-premises and reduces archive sizes by eliminating duplicate messages, storing only one instance of each message attachment and then compressing the stored data.
Technology Architecture
Our technology architecture for both our security and data protection solutions consists of several common foundational components. We utilize a common architecture so that improvements of those components benefit our solutions, reducing development time.
Key common foundational components of our architecture include:
Common Core and Secure Platform
We use a proprietary operating system, built on the Linux open source kernel, which provides security and stability to protect the solutions that secure customer networks. The secure platform also provides foundational services that may include:

• | web and application servers that enable our user interface and application programming interfaces;


• | infrastructure interoperability services, such as Kerberos and Active Directory;


• | hardware abstraction layers that allow our solutions to scale from entry-level to high-capacity systems and to rapidly respond to changes in supply chain availability;


• | auto-provisioned database systems that support many of the management features and applications; and

8


• | common logging, notification and reporting services.

Continuous Updates and Real-Time Protection
Our security and data protection applications are built to provide ongoing value as the technology and security landscapes evolve. Through continuous updates via Barracuda Energize Updates, our solutions are able to continuously receive up-to-date databases and agents including:

• | information that allows us to identify spam, viruses, spyware and other Layer 7 attacks by several means, including the content, behavior and source of the data;


• | web category and application databases;


• | information about the latest document types to properly identify text/content for indexing and searching;


• | detailed formats of social media web requests that allow us to provide data loss prevention and archival services;


• | backup agents for the latest versions of the newest desktop and server software; and


• | policy definitions for enforcement of content policies, including social security number and credit card patterns.

Shared Software Components
Many of our solutions share our proprietary software modules that are core to our business. This approach enables us to benefit from significant time and cost savings from rapid integration of our library of shared software components. For example, our antivirus technology is integrated into many solutions we have developed or acquired. Other examples include:

• | powerful and versatile proxy servers for web (HTTP forward and reverse), email (SMTP) and domain name services;


• | high performance packet processing and flow tracking that allows identification of users and applications for security policy, prioritization and adaptive routing;


• | content indexing and search capabilities; and


• | agents for endpoints such as desktops, servers and mobile devices.

Shared Cloud Services
By creating our own cloud micro-services, we are able to deliver the benefits of a cloud delivery model while maintaining a small footprint in our customers’ networks. Our appliances and virtual appliances communicate with our cloud micro-services so that we can deliver new service offerings, solutions and features, such as Advanced Threat Protection, Cloud Protection Layer, cloud web categorization and deduplicated file storage, without significantly increasing the requirements of the infrastructure installed in a customer’s network. This allows us to continue delivering features in a constantly evolving environment without the potential customer satisfaction issues that arise with frequent hardware updates.
Common Management Layer
We have invested significant resources into developing an architecture that allows for centralized solution management. Our solutions are designed with common user interfaces and provide central control across different solutions. They also enable control over highly distributed networks across multiple locations, devices and geographies by relying on a cloud service where security functionality is distributed but centralized control is desired. This capability enables administrators to control and enforce policies once and apply them across multiple distributed locations. The management layer allows a global view of many devices so that they can have the latest firmware, definitions and security policies.
Where appropriate, we employ a multi-tenant architecture that allows us to serve multiple customers while securely segregating their data. The platform includes intelligent route-optimization technology that dynamically routes customer traffic quickly and effectively.
Our core management technologies also include:

• | high availability and clustering software that allows a group of systems to be managed through a single configuration interface and allows the remaining systems to continue processing for any system that might become unavailable or fail;

9


• | support tools that allows for rapid access and troubleshooting tools; and


• | an update infrastructure for delivering new versions of our firmware, as well as the definitions and databases to ensure that the systems are up to date.

Barracuda Central
Barracuda Central is our centralized and automated security intelligence center that enables continuous threat detection and monitoring. Data collected and aggregated at Barracuda Central is analyzed and used to create definitions for continuous automatic Barracuda Energize Updates for our solutions. Barracuda Central is comprised of four primary layers.
Internal and External Data Feeds
We receive data from four primary sources:

• | The Barracuda global data feed receives metadata for messages and web requests that pass through our networks from the appliances deployed in our subscribers’ networks.


• | Barracuda Labs analyzes new threats and develops innovative security approaches. The team is focused on emerging threats such as social network, cloud, mobile and web-based exploits and other forms of modern malware attacks and develops advanced detection and protection techniques.


• | Subscribers, their end-users and users of our free reputation services submit feedback on categorization, false-negatives and false-positives through various means. These means include email, web forms, user interfaces on our appliances/services and agents such as email add-ins.


• | Via third-party and community data sharing, we are able to augment our accuracy while simultaneously giving back to the community.

Automated and Manual Analysis
Through many automated and manual processes, the incoming data is analyzed and used to generate new threat definitions and new algorithms to continuously increase the effectiveness of our solutions.

• | Our security engineering team develops algorithms and mitigation techniques that are integrated into our cloud micro-services in order to increase effectiveness. We also develop corresponding algorithms and mitigation techniques that are delivered to our appliances or cloud services for local processing.


• | With our cloud micro-services, we are able to process data feeds and automatically identify the vast majority of threats. As these threats are identified, they are added to the appropriate databases for delivery via our Barracuda Energize Updates subscriptions.


• | Our security operations team monitors data feeds and tunes the algorithms in the Barracuda compute cloud. Our security operations team also works with our security engineering team to identify new algorithms that allow more threats to be automatically identified.

Continuous Updates and Real-time Protection

• | Once threats are identified and definitions are created, the definitions are delivered securely to the appliances, virtual appliances and cloud services via our Barracuda Energize Updates subscriptions. Some of these definitions are updated many times over every hour and allow for fast local processing and offline operation.


• | To reduce latency, size and performance impact of delivered definitions, we leverage our cloud micro-services, which consist of a set of protocols and services that allow our solutions to have access to up-to-the-second threat protection.

Deployed Appliances, Virtual Appliances and Cloud Services
Our appliances, virtual appliances and cloud services use the data produced by Barracuda Central to block the latest threats. These systems automatically provide feedback and metadata back into the Barracuda Central data feeds enabling continued improvements to accuracy and performance.
Our Customers
10

We target customers across a wide range of industries, including education, government, financial services, healthcare, professional services, telecommunications, retail and manufacturing. Our revenue is diversified across our entire customer base with one distribution partner accounting for 25%, 22% and 20% of total revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to this distributor are subject to an agreement between the parties which provides for an initial term of one year, with automatic one year renewal terms and permits termination by either party with 90 days written notice prior to the termination date, restricts its sales to the United States and Canada and provides for net payment to us within 30 days of the date from the date of invoice. In addition, the agreement may terminate (i) at any time upon the mutual written agreement of the distributor and us, (ii) upon written notice, subject to applicable cure periods, if the other party has materially breached its obligations under the agreement or (iii) by either party upon the other party seeking an order for relief under the bankruptcy laws of the United States or similar laws of any other jurisdiction, a composition with or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or dissolution or liquidation.
For fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated 29%, 31% and 32% of our total revenue, respectively, from customers located outside of the United States. Other financial information about our segment and geographic areas is incorporated herein by reference to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing approach is designed to be efficient for high volumes of transactions. Our marketing efforts focus on driving traffic to our websites and on generating high-quality sales leads. Our sales efforts focus on converting these leads into paying customers through a high volume, short duration sales process.
Sales
We sell our appliances, services and software to our customers using sales personnel and our global network of more than 6,500 distribution partners, managed service providers and resellers in more than 100 countries. Our inside sales force is devoted to turning highly qualified leads into purchasers of our solutions. The majority of our leads come from potential customers who have requested an evaluation of our solutions or from our existing customer base. As a result, our inside sales force typically calls potential buyers who already understand the value of our solutions and do not require a lengthy sales cycle. Our sales reach is augmented by our distributors, managed service providers and resellers to efficiently interact with our customer base for initial deployment and cross-selling additional solutions.
The Barracuda Networks Reseller Program (Barracuda Partner Program) is a global network of resellers offering our solutions, service and support to our customers. We believe that our solutions and innovative marketing, lead generation and training programs provide a significant opportunity for high-quality reseller and distributor partners. Our channel network leverages our channel partners’ industry, product and geographic knowledge and their customer reach to expand our customer base. Our relationships with our partners are generally governed by our standard, non-exclusive and non-transferable reseller agreement, which provides for the appointment of the channel partner in a specified territory and net payment to us from the channel partner within 30 days of the date from the date of invoice. Additionally, either party may terminate the agreement without cause upon 30 days prior written notice or immediately by giving notice to the other party if the other party is in breach of a material provision in the reseller agreement and fails to rectify such breach within 30 days of receiving such notice.
In October 2015, we further expanded our reach into the managed service provider market through the acquisition of Intronis. Many small- and mid-sized organizations are turning to managed service providers to implement various technology solutions on a fixed monthly or annual fee or a "pay-as-you-go" basis with minimal upfront costs. Further, these managed service providers procure solutions differently than traditional resellers and have different requirements around integrations, billing, self-branding and more. The Intronis platform is designed to meet the needs of these managed service providers, and we believe it can continue to be expanded to include additional Barracuda solutions. Since the Intronis acquisition, we have made Barracuda Essentials for Office 365, Barracuda Backup and Barracuda NextGen Firewall available via Intronis for our managed service provider partners.
We implement our approach through a disciplined sales process that provides clear guidelines for our sales force, and we actively measure and manage our sales results. We offer our solutions using standardized contract terms and we enable our customers to buy our solutions in a manner convenient to them.
Marketing
11

We use a variety of online marketing programs for lead generation, as well as more traditional direct marketing and indirect channel partner marketing programs to drive interest in our solutions. These efforts leverage the high level of use of Internet search engines through search engine marketing and optimization programs. Once we drive traffic to our websites, we have well-defined processes that allow us to automatically track visitors’ activities on our website, communicate with potential customers, encourage evaluations of our solutions and generate highly qualified leads to our sales organization.
Our marketing approach focuses on creating brand awareness, allowing us to build and maintain, through relevant web-based content and online communications, a substantial customer base and community, many of whom act as advocates for Barracuda. We employ an innovative approach to traditional visual marketing through the use of signs and billboards in key locations such as airports where our target customers often travel. We also enhance brand recognition and marketing through the use of vehicles wrapped with highly-visible branding.
In addition, we attend industry trade shows and conferences, regularly communicate with industry analysts and solicit their feedback on our solutions and strategies and host webinars on current issues to create awareness of our brand and solutions.
Our Go-to-Market Strategy. We have successfully grown our business by using a go-to-market strategy that includes the following:

• | Low-Touch Sales Model. Our marketing efforts drive customers to fill out online forms in which they provide information about their business and specific IT needs. Our inside sales force is responsible for following up on these qualified leads from our partners and our website and working to turn potential customer interest into opportunities that our channel partners can fulfill. For example, based on the information a customer completes on one of our online forms, our inside sales force may call the customer and walk them through an online demo and connect them to a channel partner. In larger transactions, our field sales team may become involved in a transaction to help a channel partner close an opportunity.


• | Global Partner Network. We leverage our channel network to augment our inside sales force, giving us access to a broader potential customer base than we would be able to access on our own. We believe this greatly expands our distribution leverage as many times our customers order through our partner network without the involvement of our sales team.


• | 30-Day Right to Return. For the majority of our solutions, new sales include a 30-day right to return. The risk-free nature of the transaction allows our customers to more quickly adopt Barracuda solutions and realize the value.


• | Renewals and Cross-Selling. As our existing customers grow, we may have opportunities to sell more advanced versions of our solutions as well as cross-sell adjacent solutions. We have a dedicated sales team that focuses exclusively on renewals. We employ training and marketing programs to assist our sales force and channel partners to better sell into our sizable customer base. Because of our robust solution portfolio, an existing customer provides us with multiple additional sales points as they look to consolidate suppliers while expanding their IT systems.

Customer Support
Barracuda Technical Support. Customer support is an essential element of our business model and we are focused on the impact of support on our customers’ experience. Our award-winning customer support includes multiple support options. All calls are answered and managed by trained Barracuda support agents 24x7x365. Moreover, we do not use phone trees and every call is answered live. We also offer multilingual support.
We hire our customer support agents based on their customer service experience and orientation and then provide supplemental in-house training to help them build their knowledge base and skill set. Our agents are categorized in tiers based on their skills. Tier 1 agents handle initial setup, basic support and troubleshooting. Tier 2 agents address detailed troubleshooting, analysis and support. Tier 3 agents address advanced issues, backend analysis and support. Finally, engineering support is available for any unresolved issues escalated appropriately. Agents of varying skill level sit together in groups in order to best serve our customers as well as foster a collaborative environment in which our agents can learn and grow their skills.
We offer self-service support in the form of our online knowledge base, community forum and documentation portal. We also offer an online community forum, which offers information, updates and peer support. We also offer Barracuda Campus to our customers, where they can access in-person and online trainings, technical documentation and whitepapers.

Support Subscriptions. We provide a number of support subscriptions with our portfolio of solutions.
Barracuda Energize Updates. The required Barracuda Energize Updates subscription and virtual appliance subscriptions provide our customers with access to Barracuda Technical Support.
Instant Replacement. Instant Replacement provides replacement hardware with next business day shipping. Along with providing priority replacements in case of equipment failure, the Instant Replacement subscription also provides ongoing migration to the latest hardware platforms through the Barracuda Hardware Refresh Program, enabling customers to receive a new hardware unit every four years at no additional cost.
Premium Support. Barracuda Premium Support provides for a dedicated account manager and a team of technical engineers to provide fast resolution of high-priority support issues, helping to ensure continuous uptime in mission-critical environments.
Manufacturing
We manufacture our appliances at our manufacturing facilities in Silicon Valley. By managing manufacturing locally and maintaining a highly flexible workforce, we are able to easily scale our manufacturing operations and react rapidly to customer needs. This enables us to support efficient, flexible, "just-in-time" manufacturing and key features of our business model such as real-time order fulfillment and our Instant Replacement program. Although we currently depend on a single source or a limited number of sources for certain components used in the manufacture of our appliances and are therefore subject to the risk of shortages in supply of these components, to date we have not experienced a significant delay in shipments. We generally use commodity hardware in our appliances, which is readily available from multiple sources, and we do not have any long-term supply agreements. Sourcing our materials from multiple suppliers enables us to fill orders with short lead-time and lower manufacturing costs.
Backlog
Appliances are shipped and billed shortly after receipt of an order. We do not believe that our appliance backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue in any given period as we offer our customers a 30-day right of return for the majority of our solutions. Additionally, the majority of our appliance revenue comes from orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter. Orders for subscriptions are billed shortly after receipt of an order and are included in deferred revenue. Timing of revenue recognition for subscriptions may vary depending on the contractual service period or when the services have commenced.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are focused on the development of new solutions, including software and cloud solutions, and the integration of additional features and capabilities into our existing solutions. Our product management and engineering teams have extensive security and data protection expertise and work closely with customers to identify their current and future needs. The experience of our design teams enables us to effectively assess the tradeoffs and advantages when determining which features and capabilities of our solutions should be implemented.
We believe that innovation and timely development of new features and solutions is essential to meeting the needs of our customers and improving our competitive position. We test our solutions thoroughly to certify and ensure interoperability with third-party hardware and software products.
Our research and development expenses were $75.1 million, $71.3 million and $58.7 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections.
As of February 28, 2017, we had 65 issued patents that expire between July 2017 and April 2034 and 22 patent applications pending in the United States. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. We also license software from 
13

third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in our markets have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in litigation. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our customers. Our standard license and other agreements may obligate us to indemnify our channel partners and customers against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain solutions or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights, royalties or other fees. In addition, if we become more successful, competitors may try to develop solutions and services that are similar to ours that may infringe our proprietary rights. Competitors or other third parties may also be more likely to claim that our solutions infringe their proprietary rights. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
Competition
We operate in the intensely competitive security and data protection markets that are characterized by constant change and innovation, and we expect competition to increase in the future from larger, well-established competitors and new market entrants. Changes in the application, threat and technology landscape result in evolving customer requirements. Our main competitors in these markets fall into two categories:

• | Independent content security, network security, application delivery and data protection vendors such as Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd., CommVault Systems, Inc., Datto, Inc., EMC Corporation, F5 Networks, Inc., Fortinet, Inc., Imperva, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., McAfee LLC, Mimecast Limited, Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Proofpoint, Inc., Sophos Ltd., Symantec Corporation, Veeam Software and Veritas Technologies that offer competing solutions.


• | Diversified IT suppliers such as Cisco Systems, Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and International Business Machines that have acquired large security specialist vendors in recent years, that have software- or hardware-based storage solutions or that have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market.

In addition, we compete with companies that offer point solutions that compete with some of the features present in our platform. As our market grows, we believe it will attract more highly specialized vendors as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their solutions more effectively.
The principal competitive factors in our market include:

• | solution ease-of-use;


• | solution features, reliability, performance and effectiveness;


• | solution line breadth and applicability;


• | solution extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;


• | price and total cost of ownership;


• | proactive live technical support;


• | strength of sales and marketing efforts; and


• | brand awareness and reputation.

14

We believe we generally compete favorably on the basis of these factors. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources; greater name recognition; stronger reputations and longer operating histories; larger sales and marketing budgets; broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and customers; lower labor and development costs; greater customer support resources; larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and greater resources to make acquisitions.
Employees
As of February 28, 2017, we had 1,490 full-time employees. Although we are subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good.
