 Item 1.   Business
     Overview
     We are an independent oil and gas exploration company and have been the Operator of a concession to explore 5,000 square kilometers of acreage in offshore Republic of Guinea ("Guinea") in Northwest Africa pursuant to rights granted to us by Guinea (the "Concession") under a Hydrocarbon Production Sharing Contract, as amended ("PSC"). The PSC granted to us the right to explore for hydrocarbons on the Concession and, if commercial discoveries are made, submit for the approval of the authorities of Guinea a development plan aimed at producing discovered hydrocarbons over a period of 25 years.  We applied for and received a one-year extension to the Exploration Period of the PSC beginning on September 22, 2016.  The one-year extension to the Exploration Period expired on September 21, 2017, and our 50% partner, South Atlantic Petroleum Ltd. (“SAPETRO”)  elected not to apply for an appraisal period and officially withdrew from the Joint Operating Agreement and the PSC.  However, on the basis of a five-meter calculated hydrocarbon pay zone encountered in the Fatala-1 well, we applied for a two-year appraisal period on a 100% basis on September 19, 2017 and we are awaiting the decision of the Government of Guinea on our appraisal application. There can be no assurance that such application will be approved, or if it is, that it will be on terms acceptable to us. 
     The following discussion generally assumes that an appraisal period on the Concession is granted by the government of Guinea on acceptable terms.  If this does not occur, the PSC will have terminated by its terms on September 21, 2017, and we will not have any exploration asset nor any prospect of revenues or cash flows to cover current obligations and ongoing operating expenses.  On November 14, 2017, we had $0.7 million in unrestricted cash and $9.9 million in current liabilities.  Absent cash inflows, we will exhaust our current available liquidity within the next three months.   
     We sold a 23% gross interest in the Concession to Dana Petroleum, PLC (“Dana”), a subsidiary of the Korean National Oil Corporation, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and a 40% gross interest to Tullow Guinea Ltd. (“Tullow”) during the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Tullow became the Operator of the Concession on April 1, 2013. Dana and Tullow transferred their interest back to us on August 15, 2016 following a dispute stemming from their refusal to resume petroleum operations. As part of the legal settlement with Tullow, we received long-lead items useful in the drilling of an exploratory well, and $0.7 million in cash, in return for a mutual release of all claims. We also agreed to pay Dana a success fee which is based upon $50,000 per million barrels upon declaration of the certified commercial reserves of the Fatala-1 well, if it results in a discovery. On September 15, 2016, we signed a Second Amendment to the PSC with the Government of Guinea granting us 100% interest in the Concession and designating us as Operator and received a Presidential Decree on September 22, 2016. On March 30, 2017, we sold a 50% interest in the Concession to SAPETRO and executed a Third Amendment to the PSC with the Government of Guinea on April 12, 2017. We received a Presidential Decree on April 21, 2017.  As required by this Presidential Decree, we commenced drilling operations upon the Pacific Scirocco drillship entering Guinean continental shelf waters, and subsequent to that, spudded the Fatala-1 well on August 11, 2017, for which drilling operations were completed on September 8, 2017.
      In addition to clarifying certain elements of the PSC, we agreed in the Second PSC Amendment to drill one exploratory well to a minimum depth of 2,500 meters below the seabed (the “Extension Well”) within a one-year extension to the second exploration period (the “PSC Extension Period”) with the option of drilling additional wells. Upon testing the three objectives in the Fatala well by reaching a depth of 2,229 meters, below the seabed, Guinea agreed that the work obligation had been fulfilled.  We also documented to the National Office of Petroleum of Guinea (“ONAP”), our expenditures on the well, which exceeded the $46 million expenditure obligation during the PSC Extension Period.
      The Farmout Agreement was completed between the SCS and SAPETRO on June 2, 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the Farmout Agreement, SCS assigned and transferred to SAPETRO 50% of its 100% gross participating interest in the PSC and executed a Joint Operating Agreement (“JOA”). Upon closing, SAPETRO (i) reimbursed SCS its proportional share of past costs associated with the preparations for the drilling of the Fatala-1 well which amounted to $4.4 million, and (ii) pay its participating interest's share of future costs in the Concession.
     On June 5, 2017, SCS received $4.1 million from SAPETRO in accordance with a Preliminary Closing Statement delivered by SCS, thus completing closing of the Farm-out Agreement and the assignment to SAPETRO of the 50%

participating interest in the PSC, the parties executed the Joint Operating Agreement in the form attached to the Farm-out Agreement, governing the conduct of operations, and Hyperdynamics executed a parent guaranty of SCS's obligations as required by the Farm-out Agreement. On June 12, 2017, we delivered to SAPETRO a Final Adjustment Statement with the final calculation of past costs incurred by SCS in the amount of $0.7 million. After final review done by SAPETRO the Final Adjustment Statement was submitted to SAPETRO, under which SAPETRO paid to SCS $0.3 million.
     On July 12, 2017, we obtained a letter from the Director General of the National Office of Petroleum of Guinea stating that in the event of an oil discovery at the end of the drilling of the Fatala-1 well, the government would have no objection to granting an additional period of two years to enable us to carry out the work of appraisal on the Concession.
     We spudded the Fatala-1 well in a water depth of 2,897 meters on August 11, 2017 and completed the well at a depth of 5,116 meters below sea level on September 8, 2017. We did not encounter oil in the main zone of the well, but based on subsequent interpretation of the data, we calculated that we encountered a five-meter hydrocarbon pay zone, which we believe is a petroleum discovery that implies the presence of commercially exploitable resources.  The Fatala-1 well was plugged and abandoned.
     On September 19, 2017, SAPETRO notified us that it did not wish to participate in the application for the two-year appraisal program and subsequently withdrew from the JOA and the PSC on September 20, 2017. 
     We applied for an appraisal period on a 100% basis on September 19, 2017, in accordance with  our PSC, which provides that in case there is a petroleum discovery during the Extension Period and there is insufficient time to carry out the appraisal works of said discovery, an appropriate representative of the Government of Guinea has the authority to grant an extension for two additional years.   
     We are awaiting the decision of the Government of Guinea on our appraisal application.
     On October 8, 2017, we  agreed to a settlement of all of SAPETRO’s remaining obligations under the PSC and JOA for a payment to us of $4,924,000.       
     Our primary focus is the advancement of exploration work in Guinea. We have not received any confirmation that our  application for an appraisal program will be granted and are not certain if it ever will. We have no source of operating revenue, and there is no assurance when we will, if ever. We have no operating cash flows, and we will require substantial additional funds, through participation arrangements (if the appraisal period is granted), securities offerings, or through other means, to fulfill our business plans. If the appraisal period is granted and we farm-out interests in the Concession, our percentage interest will decrease. The terms of any such arrangements may not be advantageous. Our need for additional funding may also be affected by the uncertainties related to petroleum operations and the planned exploratory well, and other risks discussed under "Risk Factors" below.  
     Our executive offices are located at 12012 Wickchester Lane, Suite 475, Houston, Texas 77079, and our telephone number is +1-713-353-9400.
     Stock Purchase Agreement with CLNG
     On November 2, 2017, we executed an agreement to issue and sell 40 million shares of our common stock at a price of $0.15 per share (for a total purchase price of $6,000,000) to CLNG or its affiliate (the “Buyer”).  CLNG is a private investment company involved in global energy and mineral projects.  The closing of the sale is subject to (i) the completion of satisfactory due diligence by each party of the other, (ii) waiver by holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of their right of first refusal, (iii) negotiation of reductions in our outstanding current liabilities satisfactory to CLNG, and (iv) satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.  The form of the stock purchase agreement with CLNG is filed as an Exhibit with this Form 10-K.  If this purchase is completed, CLNG will own approximately 53% of our outstanding common stock.

 The Buyer agreed to place the $6,000,000 purchase price in escrow by November 9, 2017, but as of the date of this Report, that has not occurred.  We agreed with the Buyer to delay depositing the funds in escrow until preliminary due diligence is concluded by both parties.
     If the transaction closes, CLNG has informed us that it intends, as majority stockholder, to expand the Board of Directors to seven members and to appoint four directors who will form a majority of Hyperdynamics’ board of directors.  The stock purchase agreement provides that Ray Leonard will remain President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company, and Jason Davis will remain Chief Financial Officer, subject to the discretion of the board and resolutions of the stockholders.  There can be no assurance that our due diligence of the Buyer will be acceptable to us, that the Buyer’s due diligence of us will be acceptable to the Buyer, that all holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will waive their right of first refusal, that we will successfully negotiate reductions in our outstanding current liabilities satisfactory to CLNG, or, even if these conditions are satisfied, that the stock purchase agreement will close.
     We have agreed to indemnify the Buyer and its stockholders, partners, members, officers, directors, employees and direct or indirect investors and any of the foregoing persons’ agents or other representatives against all actions, claims, losses, costs and damages, and expenses in connection therewith incurred by any indemnitee as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to (a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by us in the stock purchase agreement and other agreements entered into by the parties in connection therewith (“Transaction Documents”) or any other certificate or document contemplated thereby, (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the Company contained in the Transaction Documents or any other certificate or document contemplated thereby or (c) any cause of action, suit or claim brought or made against an indemnitee by a third party (including for these purposes a derivative action brought on behalf of the Company) and arising out of or resulting from (i) the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any transaction financed or to be financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of the issuance of the shares of common stock to the Buyer, or (iii) the status of the Buyer or holder of the common shares as an investor in the Company.
     The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the stock purchase agreement to pay outstanding obligations.  
     CLNG has had no prior business relationship with the Company and, to the Company's knowledge, does not currently own any of the Company's securities.
     See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—We have entered into an agreement to raise $6,000,000 through the sale of 40,000,000 shares of our common stock, but there can be no assurance that this financing will be completed,” —If the stock purchase agreement with CLNG closes, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution of your ownership interest, and our stock price could be negatively impacted,” and “—If the stock purchase agreement with CLNG closes, CLNG or its affiliate will own a majority of our outstanding voting stock and will have effective control of the Company and could preclude other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions” for a discussion of certain risks associated with the proposed sale of shares to CLNG or its affiliate.
     OPERATIONS OFFSHORE GUINEA
     The PSC 
     We have been conducting exploration work related to offshore Guinea since 2002. On September 22, 2006, we entered into the PSC with Guinea. Under that agreement, we were granted certain exclusive contractual rights to explore and exploit offshore oil and gas reserves, if any, off the coast of Guinea. We refer to the rights to the offshore area subject to the Concession as the "Contract Area."
     On March 25, 2010, we entered into the First PSC Amendment with Guinea. In May 2010, the government of Guinea issued a Presidential Decree approving the PSC, as amended by the First PSC Amendment. The First PSC Amendment clarified that we retained a Contract Area of approximately 25,000 square kilometers or 30% of the original Contract Area under the PSC. The First PSC Amendment required that an additional 25% of the retained Contract Area be relinquished by September 21, 2013 as part of the renewal of the second exploration period. As of June 30, 2016, the 

 
  4

 
Contract Area was 18,750 square kilometers. Under the terms of the First PSC Amendment, the first exploration period ended and the second exploration period began on September 21, 2010. The second exploration period ran until September 2013, at which point it was renewed to September 2016.
     The First PSC Amendment required the drilling of an exploration well, which had to be commenced by year-end 2011 and drilled to a minimum depth of 2,500 meters below seabed. This requirement was satisfied with the drilling of the Sabu-1 well which was commenced during October of 2011 and reached the minimum depth of 2,500 meters below the seabed in February of 2012. It also required the acquisition of at least 2,000-square kilometers of 3D seismic data which was satisfied by the 3,600-square kilometer seismic acquisition in 2010-2011. To satisfy the September 2013-2016 work requirement, the Consortium is required to commence drilling of an additional exploration well by the end of September 2016, to a minimum depth of 2,500 meters below seabed. We spent approximately $200 million fulfilling work obligations under the PSC through fiscal 2016.
     Under the First PSC Amendment, Guinea may participate in development of any discovery at a participating interest of up to 15% of costs being carried for its share. The cost of that carry is to be recovered out of 62.5% of Guinea's share of cost and profit oil.  It also required the establishment of an annual training budget for the benefit of Guinea's oil industry personnel, and obligated the Consortium to pay an annual surface tax of $2.00 per square kilometer on the retained Concession acreage. The First PSC Amendment further provided that should the Guinea government note material differences between provisions of the First PSC Amendment and international standards or the Petroleum Code, the parties will renegotiate the relevant articles.
     On September 15, 2016, we executed the Second PSC Amendment in which we received a one (1) year extension to the second exploration period of the PSC to September 21, 2017 and confirmed that we were the holder of a 100% interest in the Concession following the official withdrawal by Tullow and Dana on August 15, 2016. The Second PSC Amendment became effective upon the receipt of a Presidential Decree on September 22, 2016.
     We executed a Second Amendment to the PSC ("Second PSC Amendment") on September 15, 2016, and received a Presidential Decree on September 22, 2016 that gave us a one-year extension to the second exploration period of the PSC to September 22, 2017 ("PSC Extension Period") and became the designated Operator of the Concession.
     In addition to clarifying certain elements of the PSC, we agreed in the Second PSC Amendment to drill one exploratory well to a minimum depth of 2,500 meters below the seabed within the PSC Extension Period (the "Extension Well") with a projected commencement date of May 2017 and the option of drilling additional wells. Fulfillment of the work obligations exempts us from the expenditure obligations during the PSC Extension Period.
     In turn, we retained an area equivalent to approximately 5,000 square kilometers in the Guinea offshore waters and were obliged to provide the Government of Guinea: (1) A parent company guarantee for the well obligation, (2) monthly progress reports and a reconciliation of budget to actual expenditures, (failure to provide the reports and assurances on a timely basis could result in a notice of termination with a 30-day period to cure), and (3) certain guarantees to Guinea.
     For the purposes of calculation for this clause (Article 4 of the PSC), however, only costs spent for services and goods provided in Guinea were to be taken into account until the drilling rig to be used in the drilling of the Extension Well is located in the territorial waters of the Republic of Guinea. 
     Additionally, we agreed to limit the cost recovery pool to that date to our share of expenditures in the PSC since 2009 (estimated to be approximately $165,000,000 net to our interest).  Finally, we agreed to allocate and administer a training budget during the PSC Extension Period for the benefit of the Guinea National Petroleum Office of $250,000 in addition to any unused portion of the training program under Article 10.3 of the PSC. The unused portion of the training program is now estimated to be approximately $221,000.
     We also agreed to allocate up to a maximum total budget of $120,000 for the actual travel and operating expenses incurred by Guinea for its participation in the management and administration of the Concession, subject to our review of receipts and limited to reimbursement of actual costs. The unused portion of this budget is now estimated to be $22,000.

Finally, we agreed that we would make available for the benefit of Guinea a virtual data room containing all seismic data in our possession relating to relinquished areas. We would not be agents of or work on behalf of Guinea, but would provide, at the request of Guinea during the PSC Extension Period, access to the virtual data room to interested third parties.
     On March 30, 2017, we entered into the Farm-out Agreement with SAPETRO. On April 12, 2017 SCS, SAPETRO and Guinea executed a Third Amendment to the PSC (the "Third PSC Amendment") that was subject to the receipt of a Presidential Decree and the closing of the Farm-out Agreement. The Presidential Decree was signed on April 21, 2017 approving the assignment of 50% of SCS' participating interest in the Guinea concession to SAPETRO, and confirmed the two companies' rights to explore for oil and gas on our 5,000-square-kilometer Concession offshore the Republic of Guinea. The contract required that drilling operations in relation to the obligation well Fatala-1 (the "Extension Well") were to begin no later than May 30, 2017 and provided that additional exploration wells may be drilled within the exploration period at the companies' option.
     The Third PSC Amendment further reaffirmed clear title of SAPETRO and SCS to the Concession as well as amended the security instrument requirements under the PSC. SCS and SAPETRO agreed to joint and several liability to the Government of Guinea in respect to the PSC. 
     SAPETRO and SCS further agreed that if SCS were unable to pay its share of any Fatala-1 well costs, SAPETRO could elect to pay for a portion of SCS's Fatala-1 well costs such amount so long as SCS is not in default of either the PSC or the Farmout Agreement. In case SAPETRO had made such payments for a share of SCS's costs of, SCS would have been obligated to assign to SAPETRO a 2% participating interest in the Concession for each $1 million of SCS's costs paid by SAPETRO.
     On May 21, 2017, drilling operations commenced upon the Pacific Scirocco drillship entering Guinean continental shelf waters.
     The Farmout Agreement was completed between the SCS and SAPETRO on June 2, 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the Farmout Agreement, SCS assigned and transferred to SAPETRO 50% of its 100% gross participating interest in the PSC and executed a Joint Operating Agreement. Upon closing, SAPETRO (i) reimbursed SCS its proportional share of past costs associated with the preparations for the drilling of the Fatala-1 well which amounted to $4.4 million, and (ii) agreed to pay its participating interest's share of future costs in the Concession.
     On June 5, 2017, SCS received $4.1 million from SAPETRO in accordance with a Preliminary Closing Statement delivered by SCS, thus completing closing of the Farm-out Agreement and the assignment to SAPETRO of the 50% participating interest in the PSC, the parties executed a Joint Operating Agreement governing the conduct of operations, and Hyperdynamics executed a parent guaranty of SCS's obligations as required by the Farm-out Agreement. On June 12, 2017, we delivered to SAPETRO a Final Adjustment Statement with the final calculation of past costs incurred by SCS in the amount of $0.7 million. After final review done by SAPETRO the Final Adjustment Statement was submitted to SAPETRO, under which SAPETRO paid to SCS $0.3 million.
     On July 12, 2017, we obtained a letter from the Director General of the National Office of Petroleum of Guinea stating that in the event of an oil discovery at the end of the drilling of the Fatala-1 well, the government would have no objection to granting an additional period of two years to enable us to carry out the work of appraisal on the Concession.
     On August 11, 2017, the actual drilling of the Fatala well commenced.  The well was completed on September 8, 2017, at a depth of 5,116 meters below sea level.  No oil shows were encountered during the drilling and the prime objective was apparently filled with silt and clay rather than reservoir quality sand and the Fatala-1 well was plugged and abandoned. 
     However, following detailed evaluation of the well results regarding the oil saturation calculation — plus our internal review and the log analysis conducted by eSeis, an independent geophysical and petrophysical consultant — ,  we have identified a section in our secondary objective, an upper Cenomanian channel (Cenomanian 03) located above the primary target formation that contained a five-meter interval with 17% porosity and 61% hydrocarbon saturation, which we believe is a petroleum discovery that implies the presence of commercially exploitable resources.  On the basis of this

discovery, on September 19, 2017, we applied to the government of Guinea for a two-year appraisal program of the Concession pursuant to Article 3.7 of our PSC on a 100% basis following SAPETRO’s vote by notice not to participate in the appraisal application.  SAPETRO formally exited from the  JOA and the PSC on September 20, 2017.  
     We are awaiting the decision of the Government of Guinea on our appraisal application. There can be no assurance that such application will be approved, or if it is, that it will be on terms acceptable to us. If the Government of Guinea does not approve our appraisal period application, the PSC will have terminated by its terms on September 21, 2017.
     Settlement of Claims with Tullow and Dana
     On August 15, 2016, we entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement (“Settlement and Release”) with Tullow and Dana with respect to our dispute in arbitration (American Arbitration Association, Case No: 01-16-0000-0679, styled SCS Corporation Ltd v. Tullow Guinea Ltd. and Dana Petroleum (E&P) Ltd.). Under the Settlement and Release, we released all claims against Tullow and Dana and (i) issued to the Government of Guinea a notice of withdrawal from the Concession and PSC effective immediately, (ii) Tullow and Dana transferred their interest in the long lead items previously purchased by the Consortium in preparation for the drilling of the Fatala well, and agreed to pay net cash of $686,570 to us. We also agreed to pay Dana a success fee which was based upon $50,000 per million barrels upon declaration of the certified commercial reserves of the Fatala-1 well, if it resulted in a commercial discovery.  We recorded the long lead items and a gain once they had been inspected and appropriately valued.
     Exploration Strategies and Work to Date
     Our business plan incorporates a multi-channel approach to exploring and developing our Contract Area under the PSC.  We plan to continue to develop and evaluate drilling targets and complete technical work.
     From the inception of our involvement in Guinea beginning in 2002 through June 2009, we accomplished exploration work, including:
    
· | a 1,000 kilometer 2D seismic data shoot, the processing of the seismic data acquired, and the evaluation of that data and data that had been acquired in the past;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a 4,000 kilometer 2D seismic data shoot, the processing of the seismic data acquired, and the evaluation of that data and data that had been acquired in the past;

      If our appraisal program application on the block is approved, we will need to raise further capital to develop and implement the appraisal program. We may raise capital through issuing equity and/or debt securities and/or farming out a portion of our participating interest in the Concession in exchange for cash and/or carry to finance project costs in respect of the retained participating interest in the Concession. There can be no assurance that such funding will be available in the amounts and at the times required.
     Subject to our ability to raise capital, we believe that we have necessary staff and knowledge to continue being project operator through the appraisal period. However, we would likely seek a large oil & gas company to farm into the Concession to become an operator for the development phase of the project. To achieve this, we may seek to dispose of a portion of our participating interest in the Concession to such operator for consideration to be determined. No assurance can be given that any of these actions can be completed.
     DESCRIPTION OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES
     The Contract Area is located in the Transform Margin play, offshore Guinea. Following the relinquishment of approximately 77% of the remaining Contract Area as required by the Second PSC Amendment, we had the exclusive exploration and production rights, along with our then partner SAPETRO, to explore and develop approximately 5,000 square kilometers in offshore Guinea under the Concession and received a one-year extension of the PSC to September 21, 2017. The extension period is not renewable except in the case of a discovery, in which case, if an appraisal program is approved, we will have up to two additional years to allow the completion of the appraisal of any discovery made. Following a discovery on the Fatala-1 well, we have submitted an application to be granted a two-year appraisal period for the block, although the marginal nature of the discovery means that it is by no means certain that the Government of Guinea will accept our appraisal program proposal.   We are currently awaiting the decision of the Government of Guinea on our appraisal application.
     An exploration well with a minimum depth of 2,500 meters below the seabed and a minimum cost of $46,000,000 was required to be drilled by September 21, 2017 to satisfy the work requirement during the PSC Extension Period. Under the terms of a Third PSC Amendment, we agreed to provide a satisfactory Security instrument in the amount of $5 million within 30 days of the receipt of the April 21, 2017 Presidential Decree, which was released at such time that the drilling rig used in the drilling of the extension well was located in the shelf waters of the Republic of Guinea, including its territorial waters. We also agreed that drilling operations for the Fatala-1 well must commence no later than May 30, 2017. The Pacific Sirocco entered territorial waters of the Republic of Guinea and began drilling operations on May 21, 2017.
     Our prospects are in an underexplored basin among multiple highly prospective trends with Turbidite fans and 4-way closures. Two wells have been drilled in the Contract Area: the GU-2B-1 well (1977) and the Sabu-1 well (2012). The GU-2B-1 well was drilled by another company reaching a total depth of 3,253 meters below seabed. Drilling of the Sabu-1 well by us was finished in February 2012 reaching a total depth of 2,891 meters below seabed.
     The GU-2B-1 well drilled in 1977 demonstrated good Upper Cretaceous shelf reservoirs and source rock. The oil seep and oil slick evaluation done by us in 2009 indicated a working petroleum system with mature Upper Cretaceous

marine source. Well data from the Sabu-1 well also confirmed to us the presence of a working petroleum system. Hydrocarbons in fluid inclusions in the rock drilled in the well demonstrate that the well was part of an oil-migration pathway, and oil and gas shows during drilling of the well indicate the presence of hydrocarbons in the upper Cretaceous section. Our well-log interpretations indicated residual oil (non-commercial oil saturations) in a 400-meter section of the Upper Cretaceous. The fluid sampling of Upper Cretaceous intervals did not find movable oil. We believe the Sabu-1 well was not a commercial success because of the lack of a reservoir seal such as marine shales or reservoir-seal pairs needed for a commercial accumulation.
     We acquired approximately 18,200 kilometers of 2D seismic and 7,635 square kilometers of 3D seismic (with 4,000 square kilometers acquired during fiscal 2012 in the deep-water portion of the Concession) to evaluate the Concession. The most recent 3D seismic (Survey C) shows thick wedges of sediment that may contain deep water sandstone reservoirs with marine shale seals that may trap significant oil accumulations, similar to recent discoveries by others on trend. We believe the Sabu-1 well results, demonstrating good reservoir and a working petroleum system, reduced the risks associated with the deeper water exploration program and support the possibility of a continuation into Guinea of the oil-prone play along the Equatorial Atlantic margin.
     The Fatala-1 well encountered the main objective, a Cenomanian Channel, however, it was filled with silt and clay rather than reservoir potential sand and also had no hydrocarbon shows.  However, the secondary objective, an upper Cenomanian channel, was penetrated at its edge and encountered five meters of good quality reservoir (17% porosity) with calculated hydrocarbon saturation of 61%.  The well result will be integrated with the seismic data to determine the commercial potential of this zone.
     Reserves Reported to Other Agencies
     We have not reported any estimates of proved or probable net oil or gas reserves to any federal authority or agency since July 1, 2008, on producing properties owned in the United States at that time, but subsequently sold in 2009.     Production
     We have no producing properties and have had no production during the years covered by the financial statements in this Report.
     Delivery Commitments
     We have no existing contracts or agreements obligating us to provide a fixed or determinable quantity of oil or gas in the future.
     Employees and Independent Contractors
     As of the date of this report, we have 16 employees, all of whom are based in the United States. We also use independent contractors from time to time for specific projects and functions.  No employees are represented by a union.     Competition
     We are an independent oil and gas company that, if the government approves our application for a two-year appraisal period, will have the exclusive exploration and production rights to explore and develop our appraisal area offshore Guinea. We are the only operator that has conducted exploration for oil and gas in the entire offshore Guinea area since 1977. We face competition from other companies looking to evaluate the Concession for prospectivity and will likely in the future face competition regarding the sale of hydrocarbons if oil is found and produced.     Productive Wells and Acreage; Undeveloped Acreage
     We do not have any productive oil or gas wells, and we do not have any developed acres (i.e. acres spaced or assignable to productive wells). Undeveloped Acreage is owned through our Concession in offshore Guinea, a description

of and the terms of which are described above under “Operations Offshore Guinea – The PSC.” The following table sets forth the undeveloped acreage that we held as of June 30, 2017:
    
 | Undeveloped Acreage (1)(2)(3)
 | Gross Acres | Net Acres
Foreign | | 
Offshore Guinea | 1,235,840 | 617,920 
Total | 1,235,840 | 617,920 

      The PSC Extension Period expired on September 21, 2017.  However, we have applied for a two-year appraisal period on a 100% basis on September 19,  2017 and are awaiting a response to our application. 

(1) | A gross acre is an acre in which a working interest is owned. A net acre is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working or participation interests in gross acres equals one. The number of net acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof. Undeveloped acreage is considered to be those leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves.

      Drilling Activity
     An exploratory well is a well drilled to find crude oil or natural gas in an unproved area, to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir, or to extend a known reservoir.  A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. 
     In October 2011, we commenced drilling operations on the Sabu-1 well.  In February 2012, the Sabu-1 exploratory well reached the planned total depth of 3,600 meters. 
     We spudded the Fatala-1 well in a water depth of 2,897 meters on August 11, 2017 and the well was completed on September 8, 2017 at a depth of 5,116 meters below sea level.

      The seismic data we collected prior to Tullow becoming Operator and our geological and geophysical work product are maintained in our offices in the United States. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, based on our impairment assessment, we fully impaired $13.3 million and $14.3 million of unproved oil and gas properties. In fiscal year 2017, we impaired unproven oil and gas properties due to uncertainties surrounding the ability of the Company to continue operations and following the determination of non-commerciality of the Fatala-1 well ultimately fully impaired unproven oil and gas properties.  The fiscal year 2016 impairment assessment was based on the continued impasse by our members of the Consortium to resume petroleum operations and drill the next exploration obligation well, which needed to be commenced by the end of September 2016, and our inability to get interim injunctive relief from the American Arbitration Association requiring Tullow and Dana to join with SCS in the negotiation of an acceptable amendment to the PSC and to agree to a process that would result in the execution of the amendment which we hoped would have led to the resumption of petroleum operations. At the time, we believed all legal measures to require Tullow and Dana to drill the planned exploration well were exhausted. We entered in a Settlement and Release agreement with Tullow and Dana on August 15,

2016, and signed the Second PSC Amendment with Guinea on September 15, 2016, granting us a one-year extension to the PSC to September 22, 2017. We also executed a Farm-out Agreement with SAPETRO and a Third PSC Amendment with the Republic of Guinea.
     Cost of Compliance with Environmental Laws
     Management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change our estimate of environmental remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, or changes in their interpretation or administration, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from our estimates.
