Introduction
 
This annual report on Form 10-K is a comprehensive filing for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. It is being filed by us in order to move toward becoming current in our filing obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This is our first periodic filing since we filed a Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2015, on June 15, 2015. Included in this report are the audited financial statements that would have been included in annual reports on Form 10-K which were not previously filed for the years ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, as well as summarized quarterly financial information which would have been included in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which were not previously filed for each of the quarters ended January 31, 2016 and 2017, April 30, 2016 and 2017, and July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
 
Our delinquencies with regard to these filings were due to the fact that certain of the creditors sued the company, obtained default judgements and put the company in receivership, and the company discontinued operations after April 30, 2015. The Company was purchased through receivership on June 19, 2017, to settle a creditor judgment.
 
This annual report should be read together and in connection with the other reports that have been filed by us with the SEC for a comprehensive description of our financial condition and operating results. In the interest of disclosure, we have included information in this annual report certain material events and developments that have taken place through the date of filing of this annual report with the SEC.
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Blacksands Petroleum, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this document as “we”, “us”, “or the “Company”), incorporates by reference certain information from parts of other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission allows us to disclose important information by referring to it in that manner. Please refer to all such information when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All information is as of October 31, 2015 unless otherwise indicated. For a description of the risk factors affecting or applicable to our business, see “Risk Factors,” below.
 
Overview and History
 
We were formerly an oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration for, and the acquisition, development and production of, oil and natural gas reserves in the U.S. The Company formerly pursued exploration, development and exploitation drilling, complimented with property or corporate acquisitions exhibiting synergy in lands, facilities, production and operating efficiencies. Our operations were conducted through our subsidiaries, including our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Blacksands Petroleum Texas LLC (“BSPE Texas”), NRG Assets Management LLC (“NRG Assets”) and Copano Bay Holdings, LLC (“Copano Bay”) as well as ApClark LLC (“ApClark”) and Access Energy Inc. (“Access,” and collectively, the “Subsidiaries”), of which we owned 100% of the voting interests.
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 12, 2004 as Lam Liang Corp. In June 2006, we changed our name to Blacksands Petroleum, Inc., which was in line with our then new business of oil and gas exploration and development. On July 7, 2017, we converted from a non-Delaware corporation to a Delaware corporation pursuant to Section 265 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 
Access was formed under the laws of Ontario, Canada, on August 26, 2005, BSPE Texas was formed under the laws of Texas on November 9, 2009, NRG Assets was formed under the laws of Texas in October 29, 2009, ApClark was formed under the laws of Delaware on July 18, 2012 and Copano Bay was formed under the laws of Nevada on December 14, 2010. Required filings for each of these states in order to maintain operations have not been filed. These subsidiaries have essentially been abandoned under direction of the previous owners and the receiver. We have no intention of bringing required state filings for these subsidiaries.
 
Shortly after April 30, 2015, we ceased operations as we were in default on certain creditor obligations. The Company was put into receivership and was sold for $750 to satisfy outstanding judgment creditor claims.

Our Operations
 
We are a shell company as that term is defined under federal securities laws. Our business plan changed to seek to acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business that generates revenues in exchange for our securities. Management anticipates that it may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because we have nominal assets and limited financial resources. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk to our stockholders because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.
Plan of Operations
 
On June 19, 2017, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with CannaLife USA, Ltd. (“CannaLife”) where, subject to court approval, CannaLife will purchase the Company and execute a Share Exchange transaction allowing CannaLife to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase terms include the issuance of shares of Company stock to the unitholders of CannaLife representing 75% control of the Company and an aggregate sum of $750 cash.
 
This change of control allows the Company to embark on a new business plan for manufacturing and distribution of hemp products, initially focusing on a line of all-natural energy drinks infused with hemp seed oil, Omega-3s and organic caffeine.
 
We may target other operating entities for acquisition. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of S. Mark Spoone, our sole officer and director. We have not had any conversations with potential merger or acquisition targets other than CannaLife mentioned above nor have we entered into any definitive agreement with any other party. In our efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we may consider the following kinds of factors:
 


· | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
· | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
· | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by us or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
· | The cost of participation by us as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; 
· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
· | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 
· | Other relevant factors. 

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, our management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the limited capital we have available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.
 
The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, our respective needs and desires as well as those of the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of ourselves and such promoters.
 
It is likely that we will acquire our participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired company of at least 80% of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 10% of the total issued and outstanding shares. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were our stockholders prior to such reorganization.

In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of our management without any vote or approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving our company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval if possible.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in our loss of the related costs incurred.
 
During the years ended October 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, and the interim fiscal quarters since that time, with the exception of entering into a Purchase Agreement with CannaLife we have essentially been dormant as the entity went into receivership, and subsequently the controlling interest was acquired by S. Mark Spoone.
 
We do not currently engage in any business activities that provide us with positive cash flows. As such, the costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next approximately 12 months and beyond will be paid with our current cash and if necessary, with additional funds raised through other sources, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
