History and Background
 
Our original business was developing a software program that would allow for automatic call processing through voice-over-Internet protocol, or “VoIP”, technology. Our operations were limited to capital formation, organization, and development of our business plan and target customer market. We generated no revenue.
 
On February 9, 2012, we completed a reverse-triangular merger with GrowOp Technology whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of GrowOp Technology. As a result of the merger, GrowOp Technology became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Following the merger, we ceased our prior operations and are now solely a holding company with seven wholly-owned subsidiaries. We also own interests in four other subsidiaries.
 
Our Business
 
We are a vertically integrated cannabis-focused agriculture company that is committed to cultivating and providing the highest quality medical cannabis, as well as other agricultural products, such as herbs and leafy greens that are grown using classic Dutch hydroponic farming methods. We have seven wholly-owned subsidiaries, GrowOp Technology, Edible Garden, Black Oak, Blüm San Leandro, IVXX LLC, IVXX Inc. and EG Transportation, as well as ownership interests in MediFarm, MediFarm I, MediFarm II, and MediFarm I RE.

Through Black Oak, we operate a medical marijuana retail dispensary, a medical marijuana cultivation, and have a second medical marijuana cultivation facility in the early stages of construction, all in Oakland, California. Through MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II (together “MediFarm”), we operate four retail medical marijuana dispensary facilities in Nevada, and have in various stages of construction medical marijuana cultivation and production facilities in Nevada. Through MediFarm I RE, we own the real property in Nevada on which we plan to build a medical marijuana dispensary of which we are in the early planning phase. All of our retail dispensaries in California and Nevada operate under the name Blüm, which offer a broad selection of medical cannabis products including flowers, concentrates and edibles. Through IVXX, we produce and sell a line of medical cannabis flowers, as well as a line of medical cannabis-extracted products, which include concentrates, cartridges, vape pens and wax products. Through Edible Garden, we are a retail seller of locally grown hydroponic produce, herbs and floral products, which are distributed through major grocery stores such as ShopRite, Walmart, Winn-Dixie, Raley’s, Meijer, Kroger, and others throughout New Jersey, New York, Delaware, Maryland, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and the Midwest. EG Transportation is a company in good standing and no operations to date.
 
We have a “rollup” growth strategy, which includes the following components:
 
 
· | With our brand recognition and experienced management team, maximize productivity, provide economies of scale, and increase profitability through our public market vehicle;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Acquire unique products and niche players where barriers to entry are high and margins are robust, providing them with a broader outlet for their products; and 
· | Acquire multiple production facilities to capture the market vertical from manufacturing to production up to retail. 

Marijuana Industry Overview
 
Marijuana cultivation refers to the planting, tending, improving and harvesting of the flowering plant Cannabis, primarily for the production and consumption of cannabis flowers, often referred to as “buds”. The cultivation techniques for marijuana cultivation differ than for other purposes such as hemp production and generally references to marijuana cultivation and production do not include hemp.
 
Cannabis belongs to the genus Cannabis in the family Cannabaceae and for the purposes of production and consumption, includes three species, C. sativa (“Sativa”), C. indica (“Indica”), and C. ruderalis (“Ruderalis”). Sativa and Indica generally grow tall with some varieties reaching approximately 4 meters. The females produce flowers rich in tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Ruderalis is a short plant and produces trace amounts of THC, but is very rich in cannabidiol (“CBD”) and which is an antagonist (inhibits the physiological action) to THC.
 
As of March 2017, there are a total of 28 states, plus the District of Columbia, with legislation passed as it relates to medicinal cannabis. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse, has no currently-accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S., and lacks acceptable safety for use under medical supervision.
 
These 28 states, and the District of Columbia, have adopted laws that exempt patients who use medicinal cannabis under a physician’s supervision from state criminal penalties. These are collectively referred to as the states that have de-criminalized medicinal cannabis, although there is a subtle difference between de-criminalization and legalization, and each state’s laws are different.

The states that have legalized medicinal cannabis are as follows (in alphabetical order):
 

1. Alaska | 11. Maine | 21. New York 
---------------+-------------------+-----------------
2. Arizona | 12. Maryland | 22. North Dakota
3. Arkansas | 13. Massachusetts | 23. Ohio 
4. California | 14. Michigan | 24. Oregon 
5. Colorado | 15. Minnesota | 25. Pennsylvania
6. Connecticut | 16. Montana | 26. Rhode Island
7. Delaware | 17. Nevada | 27. Vermont 
8. Florida | 18. New Hampshire | 28. Washington 
9. Hawaii | 19. New Jersey | 
10. Illinois | 20. New Mexico | 

 
Medical cannabis decriminalization is generally referred to as the removal of all criminal penalties for the private possession and use of cannabis by adults, including cultivation for personal use and casual, nonprofit transfers of small amounts. Legalization is generally referred to as the development of a legally controlled market for cannabis, where consumers purchase from a safe, legal, and regulated source.
 
The dichotomy between federal and state laws has also limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. Recently the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Treasury issued guidance for banks considering conducting business with marijuana dispensaries in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must now file a Marijuana Limited Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government’s guidelines with regard to revenue that is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, since the same guidance noted that banks could still face prosecution if they provide financial services to marijuana businesses, it has led to the widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to marijuana businesses operating within state and local laws.
 
In November 2016, California and Nevada voters both approved marijuana use for adults over the age of 21 without a doctor’s prescription or recommendation, so called recreational marijuana, and permitted the cultivation and sale of marijuana, in each case subject to certain limitations. We intend to seek to obtain the necessary permits and licenses to expand our existing business to cultivate and distribute marijuana in compliance with these laws, although there is no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so. Despite the changes in state laws, marijuana remains illegal under federal law.
 
In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which is also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“the AUMA”), in a ballot initiative. Among other things, the AUMA makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to 28.5 grams of marijuana flowers and 8 grams of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, the AUMA establishes a licensing system for businesses to, among other things, cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. Many of the provisions of the AUMA do not become effective until January 1, 2018 and the California Bureau of Marijuana Control is expected to enact regulations to implement the AUMA by that date.
 
Nevada voters approved Question 2 in a ballot initiative in November 2016. Among other things, Question 2 makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, Question 2 authorizes businesses to cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. The Nevada Department of Taxation has indicated that it will enact regulations to implement Question 2 by the summer of 2017.

In an effort to provide guidance to federal law enforcement, the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) has issued Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement to all United States Attorneys in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General David Ogden on October 19, 2009, in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on June 29, 2011 and in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013. Each memorandum provides that the DOJ is committed to the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”), but, the DOJ is also committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way.
 
The August 29, 2013 memorandum provides updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning marijuana enforcement in light of state laws legalizing medical and recreational marijuana possession in small amounts. The memorandum sets forth certain enforcement priorities that are important to the federal government:
 
 
· | Distribution of marijuana to children; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Revenue from the sale of marijuana going to criminals; 
· | Diversion of medical marijuana from states where it is legal to states where it is not;
· | Using state authorized marijuana activity as a pretext of other illegal drug activity; 
· | Preventing violence in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 
· | Preventing drugged driving; 
· | Growing marijuana on federal property; and 
· | Preventing possession or use of marijuana on federal property. 

 
The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits.
 
Furthermore, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. This prohibition is currently in place until April 28, 2017.
 
We are monitoring the Trump administration’s, the DOJ’s and Congress’ positions on federal marijuana law and policy. Based on public statements and reports, we understand that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.
 
We currently operate medical marijuana businesses in California and Nevada. Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical use is permitted in California and Nevada, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable Nevada and California law and regulations. Any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
 
Our Medical Marijuana Dispensaries, Cultivation and Manufacturing
 
Black Oak Gallery
 
On April 1, 2016, we acquired Black Oak Gallery, a California corporation that operates a medical marijuana dispensary in Oakland, California under the name Blüm. Black Oak opened its retail storefront in Oakland, California in November of 2012.

Black Oak sells a combination of our own cultivated products as well as high quality name-brand products from outside suppliers. In addition to multiple grades of medical marijuana, Black Oak sell “edibles” which include cannabis-infused baked goods, chocolates, and candies; cannabis-infused topical products, such as lotions, massage oils and balms; clones of marijuana plants; and numerous kinds of cannabis concentrates, such as hash, shatter and wax. 
 
Black Oak’s target markets are those individuals located in the areas surrounding its dispensary and qualify as “patients” under state and local rules and regulations. Black Oak services approximately 1,000 patients per day and has over 42,000 registered patients. Collectively known as the Blüm Campus, Black Oak’s location consists of a retail dispensary storefront, indoor cultivation area, laboratory and a 20-car capacity parking lot.
 
During March 2017, we executed a lease for 13,000 square feet of industrial space on over 30,000 square feet of land in Oakland’s industrial corridor. We are in the final designing stages of our cultivation facility. We expect to complete construction by late 2017.
 
Blüm San Leandro
 
We incorporated Blüm San Leandro, a California corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, on October 14, 2016. Blüm San Leandro has received the necessary governmental approvals and permitting to operate a medical marijuana dispensary and production facility in San Leandro, California. We have executed a lease for 13,300 square feet of industrial space in San Leandro’s industrial corridor and are in the final planning and design stages of the retail dispensary and production facility. We also plan on incorporating community meeting space at this facility. We expect to complete construction of the dispensary by late 2017 and we expect to complete construction of the production lab and community meeting space by early 2018.
 
MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II
 
We formed three subsidiaries for the purposes of cultivation or production of medical marijuana and/or operation of dispensary facilities in various locations in Nevada. MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II have received four final dispensary licenses, two provisional cultivation licenses and two provisional production licenses from the State of Nevada, and we have received approval from local authorities with respect to all eight of such licenses. The receipt of both the provisional licenses from the State of Nevada and approval from local authorities are necessary to commence the final permitting process for the cultivation and production licenses. The receipt of final permits and licenses, as to which there can be no assurance, is necessary to commence the proposed cultivation and production businesses of MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II. Effectuation of the proposed business of each of (i) MediFarm, (ii) MediFarm I, and (iii) MediFarm II is also dependent upon the continued legislative authorization of medical marijuana at the state level.
 
Each subsidiary was formed with different investors, thus necessitating the need for multiple entities with different strategic partners and advisory board members. In addition, we anticipate each subsidiary will service a different geographical market in Nevada. We expect to allocate future business opportunities among MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II based on the locations of such opportunities.
 
We formed MediFarm, LLC on March 19, 2014. We own 60% of the membership interests in MediFarm. The remaining membership interests are owned by Camden Goorjian (20%) and by Richard Vonfeldt (20%), two otherwise unaffiliated individuals. MediFarm has received the necessary governmental approvals and permitting to operate medical marijuana cultivation, production, and/or dispensary facilities in Clark County, Nevada and a medical marijuana dispensary facility in the City of Las Vegas. As of March 2017, MediFarm has three fully operational retail medical marijuana dispensaries in the greater Las Vegas region.
 
We formed MediFarm I, LLC on July 18, 2014. We own 50% of the membership interests in MediFarm I. The remaining membership interests are owned by Forever Green NV, LLC (50%), an otherwise unaffiliated entity that also owns certain membership interests in MediFarm II. MediFarm I has the necessary governmental approvals and permitting to operate a medical marijuana dispensary in Reno, Nevada. As of March 2017, MediFarm I has one fully operational retail medical marijuana dispensary in Reno, Nevada.

We formed MediFarm II, LLC on July 30, 2014. We own 55% of the membership interests in MediFarm II. The remaining membership interests are owned by Nevada MF, LLC (30%) and by Forever Green NV, LLC (15%), two otherwise unaffiliated entities. Forever Green NV, LLC also owns certain membership interests in MediFarm I. MediFarm II has received provisional licenses from the State of Nevada to operate a medical marijuana cultivation and production facility in Spanish Springs, Nevada.
 
MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II may face substantial competition in the operation of cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in Nevada. Numerous other companies were also granted licenses, and, therefore, we anticipate that we will face competition with these other companies if such companies operate cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in and around the locations at which we operate our facilities. Our management has extensive experience in successfully developing, implementing, and operating all facets of equivalent businesses in other markets. We believe this experience will provide MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II with a competitive advantage over these other companies.
 
MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions, and other contractual provisions to protect their proprietary rights. MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II do not own any patents.
 
IVXX and IVXX Branded Products
 
On September 16, 2014, Terra Tech formed IVXX, a wholly-owned subsidiary, for the purposes of producing a line of IVXX branded cannabis flowers as well as a complete line of IVXX branded pure cannabis concentrates including: oils, waxes, shatters, and clears. 
 
The science of cannabis concentrate extraction functions on the solubility of the cannabinoids and other active ingredients in the cannabis plant. Cannabinoids are not water soluble, so to extract them properly, the cannabinoids must be dissolved in a solvent. IVXX utilizes multiple proprietary extraction methods to produce its concentrates in its lab located in Oakland, California. The Company’s extractors process raw cannabis plants and separate the chemical cannabinoids from the cannabis plant material, producing a concentrate. IVXX also sells clothing, apparel, and other various branded products. 
 
IVXX currently sells its branded products at wholesale to multiple medical cannabis dispensaries throughout California. None of IVXX’s products cross state lines. IVXX continues to actively seek opportunities to sell its products to other retailers located throughout the State of California. IVXX anticipates expanding its business into other states in which the sale of marijuana is legally permitted. In order for such expansion to occur, IVXX must secure the necessary licenses and permits required to operate in any given state, the timing and occurrence of which there can be no assurance. Initially, IVXX anticipates selling its products in Nevada in the four dispensaries operated by MediFarm and MediFarm I. They will be produced at our extraction lab operated by MediFarm II once they are issued final permits and commence operations, as to the occurrence of which there can be no assurance.
 
IVXX’s target markets are those individuals located in the areas surrounding the dispensaries that sell IVXX’s products and that qualify as “patients” under state and local rules and regulations.
 
IVXX also intends to produce, market and sell their line of IVXX branded cannabis products into the adult use, recreational cannabis markets in both California and Nevada pursuant to Proposition 64 and Question 2, respectively, which made marijuana consumption legal, with certain restrictions and rules, for adults of the age of 21. IVXX is consistently engaged in research and development with respect to increasing the efficiency of the processes used to produce its products, as well as improving the quality of its products for the benefit of its patients.

 

10

MediFarm I RE
 
On October 14, 2015, we formed MediFarm I RE, LLC. We own 50% of the membership interests in MediFarm I RE. The remaining membership interests are owned by Forever Young Investments, LLC (50%), an otherwise unaffiliated entity. MediFarm I RE is a real estate holding company that owns the real property and a building, which is situated on such real property, at which a medical marijuana dispensary facility is expected to be located. This facility is in the early stages of planning. It is our intention that MediFarm I will operate the medical marijuana dispensary.
Produce and Floral Products
 
Edible Garden
 
Edible Garden was incorporated on April 9, 2013. Edible Garden is a retail seller of locally grown hydroponic produce, herbs, and floral products that are distributed throughout the Northeast and Midwest United States. Currently, Edible Garden’s products are sold at approximately 1,800 retailers throughout these markets. Most of the produce and herbs grown by Edible Garden are certified organic. Our target customers are those individuals seeking organic and fresh produce locally grown using environmentally sustainable methods.
 
Pursuant to letter agreements with Gro-Rite Inc., a New Jersey corporation, Naturally Beautiful Plant Products LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company (“NB Plants”), and Heartland Growers Inc. (collectively the “Farmers”), have agreed to cultivate the various parts of the line of Edible Garden produce to be sold into the retail grocery channel. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, Edible Garden will manage the marketing and sales, while the Farmers will be responsible for the cultivation, packaging, and shipping of the product for retail sale under the Edible Garden brand. The terms of the agreements are now month-to-month.
 
There are numerous growers that are available to us, and therefore, we are not limited in the number of growers available nor are we dependent on any one grower. We completed construction of a greenhouse structure in 2014, which can be used to grow plants to satisfy selling demands; however, we may incur additional freight costs to distribute these plants until growers are replaced.
 
Edible Garden’s main competitors are Shenandoah Growers and Sun Aqua Farms. To a lesser extent, Edible Garden competes with Green Giant, Del Monte, Rock Hedge Herbs, and Infinite Herbs. Edible Garden is an up and coming brand that has increased its retailers to approximately 1,800 retail sellers since we acquired Edible Garden in March 2013. Edible Garden believes the following three reasons sets it apart from its competitors: (1) its branding and marketing displays, which are predominately placed in high traffic areas on its proprietary racks; (2) it uses proprietary strands and seeds for its produce and its methodology for growing such produce; and (3) all of its produce are hydroponically grown and are sold “alive” (i.e., the produce is sold “rooted”).
 
Edible Garden is dependent on one major customer. One customer, NB Plants, comprised 29%, 74% and 83% of the Company’s total consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The loss of this customer would not have a material adverse effect on Edible Garden’s business, our financial condition, or results of operation.
 
Edible Garden relies on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions, and other contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights, which are primarily its brand names, marks, and proprietary pods and seeds. Edible Garden owns trademarks but does not own any patents. Edible Garden signed an exclusive license agreement with Nutrasorb LLC, a spin-off from Rutgers University, to grow and commercialize nutritionally-enhanced lettuce varieties. Under the terms of the agreement, Edible Garden has the right to grow and sell Green and Red Superleaf Lettuce across the North American and European continents as well as Australia. With five times more antioxidants than ordinary lettuce, the produce is high in vitamins A and C, magnesium, iron and potassium contents. It also has high levels of fiber and chlorogenic acid for superior digestion. These nutritionally-enhanced, proprietary Green and Red Lettuces were developed by scientists at Rutgers University following years of intensive research.
 
Edible Garden’s produce is Global Food Safety Initiative certified. Edible Garden also obtained certain organic certifications for its products. No other governmental regulations or approvals are needed or affect its business.
 
Edible Garden’s research and development activities have primarily focused on developing and testing new pods and seeds, as well as different fertilizers, nutrient blends, and lighting.
