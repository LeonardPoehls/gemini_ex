Item 1.      BUSINESS
Company Overview
We are a leading manufacturer of exterior building products in North America, operating in two reportable segments: (i) Siding, Fencing, and Stone and (ii) Windows and Doors, which comprised approximately 47% and 53% of our sales, respectively, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.  These two segments produce a comprehensive product line of vinyl siding, designer accents, cellular PVC trim, vinyl fencing, vinyl railing, stone veneer, roofing, and vinyl windows and doors used in both the new construction market and the home repair and remodeling market in the United States and Canada.  Vinyl building products have the leading share of sales volume in siding and windows in the United States.  We also manufacture vinyl and aluminum soffit and siding accessories, aluminum trim coil, wood windows, aluminum windows, vinyl and aluminum-clad windows and steel and fiberglass doors, enabling us to bundle complementary and color-matched products and accessories with our core products.  We believe that our comprehensive product portfolio and geographically diverse, low cost manufacturing platform allow us to better serve our customers and provide us with a competitive advantage over other exterior building products suppliers.  
 Additional information concerning our business is set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
On January 31, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Pisces Midco, Inc. (“Parent”) and Pisces Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), each a wholly owned subsidiary of funds sponsored by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (“CD&R”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with Ply Gem Holdings surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Acquisition”).  At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, will be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive $21.64 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”), less any applicable withholding taxes. The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary closing conditions. As a result of the Merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company.
Unless the context indicates or requires otherwise, (i) the term “Ply Gem Holdings” refers to Ply Gem Holdings, Inc., (ii) the term “Ply Gem Industries” refers to Ply Gem Industries, Inc., our principal operating subsidiary, and (iii) the terms “we”, “our”, “us”, “Ply Gem”, and the “Company” refer collectively to Ply Gem Holdings and its subsidiaries. The use of these terms is not intended to imply that Ply Gem Holdings and Ply Gem Industries and its subsidiaries are not separate and distinct legal entities.
History
Ply Gem Holdings was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Investment Holdings, Inc. (“Ply Gem Investment Holdings”), on January 23, 2004 by affiliates of CI Capital Partners for the purpose of acquiring Ply Gem Industries from Nortek, Inc. (“Nortek”).  The Ply Gem acquisition was completed on February 12, 2004.  Prior to the Ply Gem acquisition, our business was known as the Windows, Doors and Siding division of Nortek, where the business operated as a holding company with a broad set of brands.  Since the Ply Gem acquisition, we have acquired ten additional businesses to complement and expand our product portfolio and geographical diversity.  Gary E. Robinette, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, joined Ply Gem in October 2006, and has employed the strategy of transitioning Ply Gem to an integrated and consolidated business model under the Ply Gem brand.  On January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Investment Holdings was merged with and into Ply Gem Prime Holdings, Inc. (“Ply Gem Prime”), with Ply Gem Prime being the surviving corporation.  As a result, Ply Gem Holdings was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Prime. On May 23, 2013, Ply Gem Holdings issued 18,157,895 shares of common stock in an initial public offering ("IPO"), receiving net proceeds of approximately $353.8 million. In connection with and prior to the IPO, Ply Gem Holdings also issued 48,962,494 shares of common stock in connection with the merger of Ply Gem Prime with Ply Gem Holdings being the surviving entity.
The following is a summary of Ply Gem’s recent acquisition history:

• | On April 9, 2013, Ply Gem acquired the capital stock of Gienow WinDoor Ltd. (which was amalgamated into Gienow Canada Inc. with our legacy Ply Gem Canada business effective January 2014) ("Gienow"), a manufacturer of windows and doors in Western Canada. Gienow is part of our Western Canadian windows business and is part of the Windows and Doors segment.


• | On May 31, 2013, Ply Gem completed the acquisition of Mitten Inc. ("Mitten"), a manufacturer of vinyl siding and distributor of various other exterior building products in Canada. The majority of Mitten's operations are part of the Siding, Fencing and Stone segment.


• | On September 19, 2014, Ply Gem acquired the capital stock of Fortune Brands Windows, Inc., and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries: Simonton Building Products LLC, Simonton Industries, Inc., Simonton Windows, Inc., and SimEx, Inc. (together "Simonton"). Simonton is a premier repair and remodeling window company with leading brand recognition and is part of the Windows and Doors segment. 


• | On May 29, 2015, Ply Gem acquired substantially all of the assets of Canyon Stone, Inc. (“Canyon Stone”), a manufacturer of stone veneer. Canyon Stone has manufacturing facilities in Olathe, Kansas and Youngsville, North Carolina. Canyon Stone is included in our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment.

Business Strategy
We are pursuing the following business and growth strategies:

• | Capture Growth Related to Housing Market Continued Recovery. As a leading manufacturer of exterior building products, we intend to capitalize on the continued recoveries in the new construction and the home repair and remodeling markets. The National Association of Home Builders’ (“NAHB”) 2017 estimate of single family housing starts were approximately 849,000, which was 17% below the 50-year average, representing a significant opportunity for growth as activity improves to rates that are more consistent with historical levels. Furthermore, we believe that the underinvestment in homes and the overall age of the U.S. housing stock will drive significant future spending for home repair and remodeling. 

We expect homeowners’ purchases to focus on items that provide the highest return on investment, have positive energy efficiency attributes and provide potential cost savings.  Our broad product offering addresses expected demand growth from all of these key trends through our exposure to the new construction and the home repair and remodeling end markets, diverse price points, the high recovery value for home improvements derived from our core product categories and the ability to provide products that qualify for energy efficiency rebate and tax programs currently in effect or under consideration.

• | Continue to Increase Market Penetration. We intend to increase the market penetration of our siding, fencing, and stone products and our window and door products by leveraging the breadth of our product offering and broad geographical footprint to serve customers across North America and by pursuing cross-selling opportunities. Additionally, our continued investments in product innovation and quality, coupled with strong customer service, further enhance our ability to capture increased sales in each of our core product categories. In 2017, our U.S. vinyl siding leading market position increased to approximately 40.4% from our 2016 market position of 39.8%. Beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2017, we expanded our repair and remodeling presence with the Simonton acquisition and expanded our entry into new product categories such as PVC trim and engineered slate roofing. 


• | Building Brand Equity and Driving Growth through Innovative Product Solutions. We are a leading building products manufacturer with a vision to provide sustainable and innovative solutions that help families and businesses realize their dreams through better homes and workplaces. We are committed to being the leading brand of choice in each market we serve. We create value for our stakeholders using a business model that combines a broad portfolio of high-quality sustainable products and services, efficient operations and an unrelenting customer focus. As a leader in vinyl siding, aluminum accessories, vinyl and aluminum windows, we are committed to marketing research, product innovation and marketing excellence to drive growth across the breadth of categories. 

We utilize a fully integrated approach to leverage our marketing investment across businesses with a goal of optimizing results.  We have committed resources to advancements in digital marketing with new initiatives in search engine optimization, lead generation and website user experience to engage with our target audiences directly.  Our social marketing efforts across Ply Gem brands gives us direct daily access to over 190,000 people.  We are committed to building brand equity with a stronger master brand strategy for Ply Gem and continue to advertise using traditional media such as trade advertising, radio and digital.  We continue our commitment to our Home for Good project, to help raise awareness to the need for affordable housing.  During 2017, this brand campaign delivered over 500 million impressions for our brand while positively impacting over 70 communities in the U.S.  We have helped build over 450 homes with our donation to Habitat for Humanity and our relationship with Home For Good ambassador, Darius Rucker.
We remain focused on our customers and providing best in class product and customer marketing. We successfully launched Ply Gem Engineered Roofing in 2014 and cellular PVC Trim in 2013, and continue to develop innovative product solutions within our existing categories and explore new product solutions adjacent to our core categories. The 2016 launch of our "Insight Center" in Durham, North Carolina provides a dedicated resource for innovation and product development. 
The result of our commitment to product development and innovation has been demonstrated in the approximately $530.6 million of incremental annualized sales that we recognized for new products introduced from 2015 to 2017 excluding any cannibalization of sales of pre-existing products.
We also invest in our future and further brand development by pursuing certain strategic acquisitions if they fit our strategic focus. For example, in April 2013 we acquired Gienow, a manufacturer of windows and doors in Western Canada, in May 2013 we acquired Mitten, a leading manufacturer of vinyl siding and accessories in Canada, in September 2014 we acquired Simonton, a premier repair and remodeling window company with leading brand recognition, and in May 2015 we acquired Canyon Stone, a manufacturer and distributor of stone veneer and accessories in the United States. These acquisitions provide us with access to new revenue streams and operating efficiencies to drive further market gains.

• | Drive Operational Leverage and Further Improvements. While we reduced our production capacity during the housing downturn, we retained flexibility and have since brought back previously idled lines, facilities, and production shifts in order to increase our production as market conditions continue to improve. This incremental capacity can be selectively restarted, providing us with the ability to match increasing customer demand levels as the housing market returns to historical levels of approximately one million or more single family housing starts without the need for significant capital investment. In our Windows and Doors segment, our product platforms combined with strong customer relationships enable us to serve the new construction and repair and remodeling markets driving increased volumes through our manufacturing facilities and enhancing our operating margins. 

Over the past several years, we have significantly improved our manufacturing cost structure; however, there are opportunities for further improvements.  During 2017, we announced a new initiative entitled “2x20” which represents a profitability improvement measure as a percentage of our net sales by 2020 of at least $40.0 million. We believe that the continued expansion of lean manufacturing and vertical integration in our manufacturing facilities, along with the further consolidation of purchases of key raw materials, supplies and services will continue to provide us with cost advantages compared to our competitors.  In addition, the integration of our sales and marketing efforts across our product categories provides an ongoing opportunity to significantly improve our customer penetration and leverage the strength of our brands.  Furthermore, we have centralized many back office functions into our corporate office in Cary, North Carolina and believe that additional opportunities remain including further synergies from the Simonton acquisition, continuous improvement of our manufacturing processes through automation, and further general and administration improvements.  We believe these factors should drive continued profitable growth while improving our cash flow and capital efficiency.

• | Continue to Improve Financial Leverage. As a result of the ten strategic acquisitions that we have completed since 2004, we incurred significant amounts of indebtedness to finance these acquisitions. This acquisition strategy combined with a severe housing market recession during 2009-2011 ultimately increased our financial leverage to 8.9 during 2011. Over the last several years, we have focused on improving our financial leverage. As the housing market continued to improve, so did our financial performance demonstrated by our significant cash flow generation over the last several years. During 2016 and 2017, we voluntarily elected to pay down $200.0 million on the Term Loan Facility and decreased our financial leverage to 3.4 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

Industry Overview
Demand for exterior building products, including siding, fencing, stone, windows and doors, is primarily driven by construction of new homes and repair and remodeling of existing homes, which are affected by changes in national and local economic and demographic conditions, employment levels, availability of financing, interest rates, consumer confidence and other economic factors.
New Home Construction
Management believes that a U.S. housing recovery will continue on a national basis, supported by favorable demographic trends, historically low interest rates and consumers who are increasingly optimistic about the U.S. housing market. New home construction in the United States experienced strong growth from the early 1990s to 2006, with housing starts increasing at a compounded annual growth rate of 3.8%.  However, according to the U.S Census Bureau, from 2006 to 2017, single family housing starts are estimated to have declined 42%.  While the industry has experienced a period of severe correction, management believes that the long-term economic outlook for new construction in the United States is favorable and supported by an attractive interest rate environment, increasing consumer confidence, improving employment growth and strong demographics, as new household formations drive demand for starter homes.  According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, net new household formations between 2015 and 2025 are expected to be approximately 13.6 million units. 
During 2017, single family housing starts are estimated to have increased 8.6% to approximately 849,000 compared to 2016. During 2016, single family housing starts increased 9.4% to approximately 782,000 compared to 2015. The NAHB is currently forecasting single family housing starts to further increase in 2018 and 2019 by 5.2% and 5.6%, respectively.  
Home Repair and Remodeling
Management believes that the U.S. home repair and remodeling products market is poised for a recovery. Since the early 1990s and through 2006, demand for home repair and remodeling products in the United States increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 4.3%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, as a result of strong economic growth, low interest rates and favorable demographics.  However, beginning in 2007 the ability for homeowners to finance repair and remodeling expenditures, such as replacement windows or vinyl siding, has been negatively impacted by a general tightening of lending requirements by financial institutions and the significant decrease in home values, which limited the amount of home equity against which homeowners could borrow.  Management believes that expenditures for home repair and remodeling products are also affected by consumer confidence, economic conditions, debt ceiling and national budget deliberations, and unemployment levels. Management believes the long-term economic outlook of the demand for home repair and remodeling products in the United States is favorable and supported by the move towards more energy-efficient products, recent underinvestment in home maintenance and repair, and an aging housing stock.

The breadth of our product lines and our multiple brand and price point strategy enable us to target multiple distribution channels (wholesale and specialty distributors, retailers and manufactured housing) and end users (new construction and home repair and remodeling).
Customers and distribution
We have a multi-channel distribution network that serves both the new construction and the home repair and remodeling sectors, which exhibit different, often counter-balancing, demand characteristics.  In conjunction with our multiple brand and price point strategy, we believe our multi-channel distribution strategy enables us to increase our sales and sector penetration while minimizing channel conflict.  We believe our strategy reduces our dependence on any one channel, which provides us with a greater ability to sustain our financial performance through economic fluctuations.
4

We sell our siding and accessories to specialty distributors (one-step distribution) and to wholesale distributors (two-step distribution).  Our specialty distributors sell directly to remodeling contractors and builders.  Our wholesale distributors sell to retail home centers and lumberyards who, in turn, sell to remodeling contractors, builders and consumers.  In the specialty channel, we have developed an extensive network of approximately 800 independent distributors, serving over 22,000 contractors and builders nationwide.  We are well-positioned in this channel as many of these distributors are both the largest and leading consolidators in the industry.  In the wholesale channel, we are the sole supplier of vinyl siding and accessories to BlueLinx (formerly a distribution operation of the Georgia-Pacific Corporation), one of the largest building products distributors in the United States.  Through BlueLinx, our Georgia-Pacific private label vinyl siding products are sold at major retail home centers, lumberyards and manufactured housing manufacturers.  A portion of our siding and accessories is also sold directly to home improvement centers.  Our growing customer base of fencing and railing consists of fabricators, distributors, retail home centers and lumberyards.  Our customer base of stone veneer products consists of distributors, lumberyards, retailers, builders and contractors. Our customer base of roofing products consists of distributors, lumberyards, retailers and contractors. In Canada, our complete offering of vinyl siding, accessories, trim, and moldings, along with Ply Gem manufactured and third party sourced complimentary products are primarily distributed through our 18 Mitten branch locations, to retail home centers and lumberyards, and new construction and remodeling contractors.
Our largest customer, ABC Supply Co., Inc., comprised 17.4%, 17.1%, and 16.9% of the net sales of our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Production and facilities
Vinyl siding, skirting, soffit and accessories are manufactured in our Martinsburg, West Virginia, Jasper, Tennessee, Stuarts Draft, Virginia, Kearney, Missouri, and Paris, Ontario facilities, while all metal products are produced in our Sidney, Ohio facility.  The majority of our injection molded products such as shakes, shingles, scallops, shutters, vents and mounts are manufactured in our Gaffney, South Carolina facility.  The cellular PVC trim and mouldings products are manufactured in St. Marys, West Virginia. The vinyl, metal, and injected molded plants have sufficient capacity to support planned levels of sales growth for the foreseeable future.  Our fencing and railing products are currently manufactured at our York, Nebraska and Fair Bluff, North Carolina facilities.  The fencing and railing plants have sufficient capacity to support our planned sales growth for the foreseeable future.  Our stone veneer products are manufactured at our Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, Olathe, Kansas and Youngsville, North Carolina facilities.  Our engineered slate and cedar roofing products are currently manufactured at our Fair Bluff, North Carolina facility. Our manufacturing facilities are among the safest in all of North America with three of them having received the highest federal and/or state OSHA safety award and rating.
Raw materials and suppliers
PVC resin and aluminum are major components in the production of our Siding, Fencing, and Stone products. PVC resin and aluminum are commodity products and are available from both domestic and international suppliers. Changes in PVC resin and aluminum prices have a direct impact on our cost of products sold.  Historically, we have been able to pass on the price increases to our customers.  The results of operations for individual quarters can be negatively impacted by a delay between the time of raw material cost increases and price increases that we implement in our products, or conversely can be positively impacted by a delay between the time of a raw material price decrease and competitive pricing moves that we implement accordingly.
Recycled plastics are a major component in the production of our roofing products. The price of recycled plastics has risen above historical levels and is expected to remain high. The recycled plastic market is driven by supply and demand and therefore causes the recycled plastic market to be volatile.
5

Competition
We compete with other national and regional manufacturers of vinyl siding, aluminum, cellular PVC, fencing, and stone products. We believe we are currently the largest manufacturer of vinyl siding in North America. Our vinyl siding competitors include CertainTeed, Alside, Royal Building Products and smaller regional competitors. Based on our internal estimates and industry experience, we believe that we have a U.S. vinyl siding market position of 40.4% in 2017, and a Canadian market position of 32.7%. Our aluminum accessories competitors include Rollex, Euramax, Gentek and other smaller regional competitors. Significant growth in vinyl fencing and railing has attracted many new entrants, and the sector today is fragmented with numerous competitors including U.S. Fence, Homeland, Westech, Bufftech, and Azek. Our cellular PVC trim and moulding competitors include Azek, Inteplast, Kommerling (KOMA), Wolfpac (Versatex), Tapco (Kleer), CertainTeed and Royal Building Products. Our stone veneer competitors include Boral (Cultured Stone and Eldorado Stone), Coronado Stone and smaller regional competitors. We generally compete on product quality, breadth of product offering, sales and service support. In addition to competition from other vinyl siding, fencing and stone products, our products face competition from alternative materials, such as wood, metal, fiber cement and masonry. Increases in competition from other exterior building products manufacturers and alternative building materials could cause us to lose customers and lead to net sales decreases.
Intellectual property
We possess a wide array of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, tradenames, licenses, proprietary technology and know-how and other proprietary rights.  In connection with the marketing of our products, we generally obtain trademark protection for our brand names in the Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment.  Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not become generic.   Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use.  With Mitten Building Products in the Canadian market, we license our Procanna Windows and Doors brand for the production of exclusive Mitten distributed products from contracted, regional third-party fabricators. We license the Georgia-Pacific trademark for our Georgia-Pacific private label vinyl siding products sold through BlueLinx. While we do not believe the Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment is dependent on any one of our trademarks, we believe that our trademarks are important to the development and conduct of our business as well as the marketing of our products.  We vigorously protect all of our intellectual property rights.
Seasonality
Markets for our products are seasonal and can be affected by inclement weather conditions.  Historically, our business has experienced increased sales in the second and third quarters of the year due to increased construction during those periods.  Because a portion of our overhead and expenses are fixed throughout the year, our operating profits tend to be lower in the first and fourth quarters.  Inclement weather conditions can affect the timing of when our products are applied or installed, causing delayed profit margins when such conditions exist.
We generally carry increased working capital during the first half of a fiscal year to support those months where customer demand exceeds production capacity.  We believe that this is typical within the industry.
Backlog
Our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment had a backlog of approximately $26.8 million at December 31, 2017 and a backlog of approximately $20.3 million at December 31, 2016.  We filled 100% of the backlog at December 31, 2016 during 2017. We expect to fill 100% of the orders during 2018 that were included in our backlog at December 31, 2017.
Windows and Doors segment
Products
In our Windows and Doors segment, our principal products include vinyl, aluminum-clad vinyl, aluminum, wood and clad-wood windows and patio doors and steel, wood, and fiberglass entry doors that serve both the new construction and the home repair and remodeling sectors in the United States and Canada.  Our products in our Windows and Doors segment are sold under the Ply Gem® Windows, Simonton® Windows, Great Lakes® Window, and Ply Gem® Canada brands.  A summary of our current product lines is presented below according to price point:

We continue introducing new products to the portfolio which allow us to enter or further penetrate new distribution channels and customers.  The breadth of our product lines and our multiple price point strategy enable us to target multiple distribution channels (wholesale and specialty distributors, retailers and manufactured housing) and end user markets (new construction and home repair and remodeling).
Customers and distribution
We have a multi-channel distribution and product strategy that enables us to serve both the new construction and the home repair and remodeling markets.  By offering this broad product offering and industry leading service, we are able to meet the local needs of our customers on a national scale.  This strategy has enabled our customer base (existing and new) to simplify their supply chain by consolidating window suppliers.  Our good, better, best product and price point strategy allows us to increase our sales and sector penetration while minimizing channel conflict.  This strategy reduces our dependence on any one channel, providing us with a greater ability to sustain our financial performance through economic fluctuations.
The new construction product lines are sold for use in new residential and light commercial construction through a highly diversified customer base, which includes independent building material dealers, regional/national lumberyard chains, builder direct/OEMs and retail home centers.  Our repair and remodeling window products are primarily sold through independent home improvement dealers, one-step distributors, and big box retail outlets.  Dealers typically market directly to homeowners or contractors in connection with remodeling requirements while distributors concentrate on local independent retailers.
In Canada, sales of product lines for new construction are predominantly made through direct sales to builders and contractors, while sales for repair and remodeling are made primarily through retail lumberyards but also direct to contractors and direct to consumers through our supply and install services.  Ply Gem Canada products are distributed through twelve Ply Gem distribution centers.
Our largest customer, The Home Depot, comprised 10.4%, 10.2%, and 9.7% of the net sales of our Windows and Doors segment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 

Production and facilities
7

Our window and door products leverage a network of vertically integrated production and distribution facilities located in Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina, Georgia, Texas, California, Washington, West Virginia, Illinois and Alberta, Canada.  Our window and door manufacturing facilities have benefited from our continued investment and commitment to product development and product quality combined with increasing integration of best practices across our product offerings.  In 2010, we began producing vinyl compound for our west coast facilities which improved our operating efficiency and resulted in lower production cost for these items.  In 2010, we continued making upgrades to insulated glass production lines in anticipation of more stringent energy efficiency requirements driven by changes in building codes and consumer demand for Energy Star rated products.
While market conditions will dictate future capacity requirements, we have the ability to increase capacity in a cost effective manner by expanding production shifts and lines.  Significant housing demand increases to historical levels may require additional capital investment in certain geographical areas to meet this increased demand. Any capacity increase may, however, initially be offset by labor inefficiencies or difficulties obtaining the appropriate labor force. Ongoing capital investments will focus on new product introductions and simplification, production automation, equipment maintenance and cost reductions.   
During 2014, our Windows and Doors segment further streamlined its product offerings by realigning its SKUs to simplify the structure and manufacturing process while maximizing product features for our customers at competitive prices. During 2014, we consolidated Canadian production and distribution facilities, and rationalized and rebranded product lines. As a result, during 2014 and 2015 four redundant distribution facilities were closed, and manufacturing was largely consolidated. During 2017, three additional Canadian distribution facilities were consolidated with our Canadian siding business to promote product cross selling.
Raw materials and suppliers
PVC compound, wood, aluminum and glass are major components in the production of our window and door products.  These products are commodity products available from both domestic and international suppliers. Historically, changes in PVC compound, aluminum billet and wood cutstock prices have had the most significant impact on our material cost of products sold in our Windows and Doors segment.  We are one of the largest consumers of PVC resin in North America and we continue to leverage our purchasing power on this key raw material.  The PVC resin compound that is used in our window lineal production is produced internally.  The leveraging of our PVC resin buying power and our PVC resin compounding capabilities benefits all of our window companies.  Our window plants have consolidated glass purchases to take advantage of strategic sourcing savings opportunities.  In addition, we have continued to vertically integrate aluminum extrusion in our window plants.
Competition
The window and patio door sector remains fragmented, comprised primarily of local and regional manufacturers with limited product offerings.  The sector’s competitors in the United States include national brands, such as Jeld-Wen, Pella and Andersen, and numerous regional brands, including MI Home Products, Atrium, Weathershield and Milgard.  Competitors in Canada include Jeld-Wen, All Weather, Durabuilt, and numerous regional brands.  We generally compete on service, product performance, product offering, sales and support.  We believe all of our products are competitively priced and that we are one of the only manufacturers to serve all end markets and price points.
Intellectual property
We possess a wide array of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, tradenames, licenses, proprietary technology and know-how and other proprietary rights.  In connection with the marketing of our products, we generally obtain trademark protection for our brand names in the Windows and Doors segment.  Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not become generic.  Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. While we do not believe the Windows and Doors segment is dependent on any one of our trademarks, we believe that our trademarks are important to the Windows and Doors segment and the development and conduct of our business as well as the marketing of our products.  We vigorously protect all of our intellectual property rights.
Seasonality
8

Markets for our products are seasonal and can be affected by inclement weather conditions.  Historically, our business has experienced increased sales in the second and third quarters of the year due to increased construction during those periods.  Accordingly, our working capital is typically higher in the second and third quarters as well. Because much of our overhead and expense are fixed throughout the year, our operating profits tend to be lower in the first and fourth quarters.  Inclement weather conditions can affect the timing of when our products are applied or installed, causing lower profit margins when such conditions exist.
Because we have successfully implemented lean manufacturing techniques and many of our windows and doors are made to order, inventories in our Windows and Doors segment do not change significantly with seasonal demand.
Backlog
Our Windows and Doors segment had a backlog of approximately $57.6 million at December 31, 2017 and approximately $45.1 million at December 31, 2016.  We filled 100% of the backlog at December 31, 2016 during 2017. We expect to fill 100% of the orders during 2018 that were included in our backlog at December 31, 2017.
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
We are subject to United States and Canadian federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to pollution and the protection of the environment, including those governing emissions to air, discharges to water, use, storage, treatment, disposal and transport of hazardous waste and other materials, investigation and remediation of contaminated sites, and protection of worker health and safety. From time to time, our facilities are subject to investigation by governmental authorities. In addition, we have been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties for contamination present at certain offsite locations to which our entities or their predecessors are alleged to have sent hazardous materials for recycling or disposal. We may be held liable, or incur fines or penalties, in connection with such requirements or liabilities for, among other things, releases of hazardous substances occurring on or emanating from current or formerly owned or operated properties or any associated offsite disposal location, or for known or newly-discovered contamination at any of our properties from activities conducted by us or previous occupants. The amount of any liability, fine or penalty may be material, and certain environmental laws impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability for the cost of addressing releases of hazardous substances upon certain classes of persons, including site owners or operators and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at contaminated sites.
MW Manufacturers Inc. (“MW”), a subsidiary of MWM Holding, Inc., entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (the “Consent Order”), effective September 12, 2011, with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), with respect to its Rocky Mount, Virginia property. During 2011, as part of the Consent Order, MW provided the EPA, among other things, a RCRA Facility Investigation Workplan (the “Workplan”) as well as a preliminary cost estimate of approximately $1.8 million for the predicted assessment, remediation and monitoring activities to be conducted pursuant to the Consent Order over the remediation period, which is currently estimated through 2023. In 2012, the EPA approved the Workplan, which MW is currently implementing. We have recorded approximately $0.3 million of this environmental liability within current liabilities and approximately $1.1 million within other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We may incur costs that exceed our recorded environmental liability. We will adjust our environmental remediation liability in future periods, if necessary, as further information develops or circumstances change. 
Environmental authorities are investigating groundwater contamination at a Superfund site in York, Nebraska. In 2010, sampling was conducted at the Kroy Building Products, Inc. (“Kroy”) facility in York, Nebraska. In February 2015, the EPA sent Kroy a request for information pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), and in May 2015, Kroy responded to the request for information. Kroy could have liability for investigation and remediation costs associated with the contamination. Given the current status of this matter, we have not recorded a liability in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
From time to time, we may incur investigation and remediation costs in connection with other facilities we currently own or operate or previously owned or operated. For example, we have a $0.1 million liability included in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, for potential contamination issues at our Calgary, Alberta property. In addition, we are required to contribute to investigation and remediation costs at various third party waste disposal facilities at which we or a related entity have been identified as a potentially responsible party.

We are a party to various acquisition and other agreements pursuant to which third parties agreed to indemnify us for certain costs relating to environmental liabilities. For example, we may be able to recover some of our Rocky Mount, Virginia investigation and remediation costs from U.S. Industries, Inc. and may be able to recover a portion of any costs incurred in connection with the Kroy contamination matter in York, Nebraska from Alcan Aluminum Corporation. Our ability to seek indemnification from parties that have agreed to indemnify us may be limited. There can be no assurance that we would receive any funds from these parties, and any related environmental liabilities or costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Based on current information, we are not aware of any environmental compliance obligations, claims or investigations that will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position except as otherwise disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. However, there can be no guarantee that previously known or newly-discovered matters will not result in material costs or liabilities.
