On July 18, 2012, the Company changed its business plan to focus on making investments in companies, whether public or private enterprises, in differing business sectors. This business plan continues to be a focus of the Company today. The Company does not restrict the target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and thus seeks to acquire a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company evaluates the acquisition of intellectual properties and technologies for investment. Such investments may be made in the United States and worldwide.
 
On September 10, 2012, the Company organized six new subsidiary companies. Each of these subsidiary companies was wholly owned (100%) by the Company. The names of the new subsidiary companies were HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc., HPIL ENERGYTECH Inc., HPIL WORLDFOOD Inc., HPIL REAL ESTATE Inc., HPIL GLOBALCOM Inc. and ART&CULTURE Inc. These companies were organized with the intention of satisfying the various growth strategies of the Company. Each of the subsidiary companies was merged with and into the Company effective as of May 28, 2015.
 

(b) | Historical Transactions. 
----+-----------------------------

 
On October 16, 2012, HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc. (formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that has been merged with and into the Company effective as of May 28, 2015) was approved to develop certain patents and related business and product owned by the Company related to a “Massage Vibrator for the Relief of Aches and Pain”, and to begin manufacture the Stimulating Massage Device in accordance with the patents. On February 22, 2013, the Company granted to HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc. an exclusive license to use the patents relating to the “Massage Vibrator for the Relief of Aches and Pain” for the production, use, or sale of the resulting products throughout the world and especially in countries where the Company owns the patents rights. The name of the initial product utilizing the patents rights is “IFLOR, Stimulating Massage Device” (the “IFLOR Device”), which the Company had authorized HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc. to develop, industrialize and manufacture. During 2013, the Company did not record any carrying value for these patents rights. However, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company determined that it was appropriate to assign a nominal value to the patents as an asset of the Company. Therefore, the Company recorded a carrying value of $1.00 for the patents rights related to the IFLOR Business. The license of the patent rights to HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc. was terminated as it was no longer necessary when HPIL HEALTHCARE Inc. was merged with and into the Company effective as of May 28, 2015. The Company sold the patent rights related to the IFLOR Business to GIOTOS Limited on December 9, 2015 (see below in this section (b) for a full description of this transaction).

(d) | Business of Issuer. 
----+------------------------

 
HPIL Holding is a worldwide holding company. The Company is focused on investing in both private and public companies in differing business sectors. The Company does not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, acquires various types of business. The Company also evaluates intellectual properties and technologies for potential acquisition.
 
During 2015, we terminated various cooperation agreements and the Product Reseller Agreement and divested several of our existing investments, including the IFLOR Asset (as discussed in section (b) of this Item above). We made these changes to reduce overall expenses related to these agreements and investments and sharpen the focus of our efforts on developing the Brand License Agreement and identifying and vetting potential alternative investments in an effort to increase the efficiency of deploying our resources. The Company intends to continue to pursue its business plan of making investments in companies and intellectual properties and providing consulting service, and expects that it will continue on that business plan for the foreseeable future. While the Company is not currently actively marketing any services or products, it will continue on its business plan of actively seeking investment opportunities for the foreseeable future. Our ability to execute the current business plan may be adversely affected by a number of factors, some of which may include:
 

● | our inability to identify potential investment opportunities; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our inability to finance such investments on terms we believe are favorable to the Company; 
● | our inability to negotiate acceptable or favorable terms for investment in identified opportunities; 
● | our inability to adequately or accurately identify potential liability exposure and other risks related to investment opportunities; 
● | our inability to effectively manage and incorporate new investments opportunities into the Company; 
● | changes in the current business plan, as set forth above, based on our strategic market studies and evaluations or other currently unknown factors; or 
● | other factors, within or outside of our control, that may affect our ability to execute our business plan in an efficient manner, including, without limitation, acts of God, changes in applicable laws, or inability to engage the necessary or strategic business partners on satisfactory terms.

 
Moreover, the Company will continue to concentrate on the development of the Brand License Agreement (see section (b) of this Item above) until it will commence in 2018. While the Company is still in the conceptual stages of the line of business that may be developed under the Brand License Agreement, we intend to explore potential manufacturing, distribution, and other strategic partnerships in connection with the Brand License Agreement. Additionally, over the next approximately 3 months, we intend to take additional steps necessary to bring the Product to market in a timely fashion, chiefly among them:
 

● | evaluate market demand for the Product, not only among WTFSKF members and fans, but possibly even beyond, and create marketing and sales strategies around the Product to reach our target consumer groups based on these evaluations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | evaluate and engage designers to develop Product concepts and designs consistent with the target consumer; and 
● | evaluate manufacturing and supply chain options to efficiently bring branded Product to various markets throughout the world. 

 
Our ability to develop a successful line of business with respect to the Brand License Agreement and related Products may be adversely affected by a number of factors, some of which may include:
 

● | our inability to adequately or accurately generate or measure demand in the market for the Products; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our inability to create or execute effective marketing and sales strategies around the Product to reach consumers and/or generate interest in and orders for the Product; 
● | our inability to engage designers or develop Product concepts that are economical and appeal to the consumer; 
● | our inability to achieve efficient manufacturing, supply chain, and/or distribution channels; 
● | changes in the current business plan, as set forth above, based on our strategic market studies and evaluations or other currently unknown factors; 
● | inadequate protection of the logos, names, and marks of WTFSKF that are licensed under the Brand License Agreement; or

Environmental Laws
 
We have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with environmental laws.

We cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditure requirements because of continually changing compliance standards and environmental technology. We do not have insurance coverage for environmental liabilities and do not anticipate obtaining such coverage in the future unless needed due to new or evolved business plans.
