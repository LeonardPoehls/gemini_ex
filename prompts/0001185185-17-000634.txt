Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
Medizone International, Inc. was incorporated in January 1986. Our focus is in the field of hospital disinfection. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we generated our first significant revenues from the sale of our AsepticSure hospital disinfection system. We cannot predict when or if we will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to fund continuing or planned operations. If we fail to obtain additional funding, we will be forced to suspend or permanently cease operations, and may need to seek protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws.
 
We are a co-founder of Canadian Foundation for Global Health (“CFGH”), which was formed to establish an independent not-for-profit foundation for research that could ultimately attract the finest scientific, medical and academic professionals possible to work on projects deemed to be of social benefit, and to provide a means for us to use a tiered pricing structure for services and products in emerging economies and extend the reach of our technology to as many in need as possible.
 
CFGH is considered to be a variable interest entity (“VIE”).  U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”)  require us to consolidate the results of CFGH.  Accordingly, the financial position and operations of CFGH have been consolidated with our financial results in our consolidated financial statements included within this Annual Report.
 
Recent Developments
 
On February 22, 2017, Edwin G. Marshall, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman informed the Company’s Board of Directors that he had decided to resign from the Board of Directors and retire from all positions with the Company, effective February 28, 2017. Mr. Marshall also advised the Board that his decision was not based on any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices. In addition, Dr. Jill Marshall, our Director of Operations, resigned effective February 28, 2017. Mr. Marshall and Dr. Marshall will support a transition to new Company management over a period of 30 to 60 days as needed and as requested by the Board of Directors.
 
The Board of Directors appointed David A. Esposito as Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer effective March 1, 2017. Mr. Esposito has been a director of the Company since 2014. He currently serves as President and CEO of Armune BioScience, Inc., an early stage medical diagnostics company focused on developing and commercializing unique technology for diagnostic and prognostic tests for prostate, lung, and breast cancers. As Interim CEO of Medizone, Mr. Esposito will lead the search for individuals with experience commercializing healthcare products to focus the Company’s efforts to raise capital for operations and to build out the Company’s sales efforts in the United States market.

Our Business
 
AsepticSure is the name of our patented, United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) registered (Reg. No. 90607-3) ozone disinfectant formula used for disinfection of non-porous surfaces in hospitals, clinics, hotels, sporting venues and in the food industry, long-term care facilities, and other critical infrastructures. In the AsepticSure system, oxygen atoms are misted into the environment with a hydrogen peroxide vapor, creating Trioxidane, and successfully achieving high rates of bactericidal kill inside an enclosed space without any residual damage to the room contents.
 
Prior to 2008, our research and development activity had been dedicated to (i) seeking regulatory approval of a precise mixture of ozone and oxygen, and the process of inactivating lipid-enveloped viruses for the intended purpose of decontaminating blood and blood products and assisting in the treatment of certain diseases; (ii) developing or acquiring the related technology and equipment for the medical application of our products, including a drug production and delivery system; and, (iii) applying our novel technology to the problem of nosocomial infections world-wide.
 
Early in 2008, we began to consider other applications of our core technologies and new technologies with lower development costs with the objective of moving us to revenue production in the shortest period of time. This new direction included re-positioning the Company to pursue an initiative in the field of hospital disinfection. After achieving laboratory results using ozone on Bacillus subtilis, an internationally recognized surrogate for anthrax, that produced 7 log reductions (sterilization), we expanded our research and business plan to include bio-terrorism countermeasures as well as hospital disinfection and critical infrastructure de-contamination. “Log” stands for logarithm, which is the exponent of 10. Log reduction stands for a 10-fold (one decimal) or 90% reduction in numbers of live bacteria. For example, a “5-log reduction” means lowering the number of microorganisms by 100,000-fold, that is, if a surface has 100,000 pathogenic microbes on it, a 5-log reduction would reduce the number of microorganisms to one. A 6-log reduction means the number of pathogenic microorganisms is 1,000,000 times smaller and a 7-log reduction means the number is 10,000,000 times smaller.
 
Standards for disinfection and sterilization refer to log reduction. “Disinfection” is considered to involve a bio-burden reduction of 99.99% (4-logs) and up to 99.999% (5-log reduction) or destruction of 999,990 out of 1,000,000 organisms, leaving behind very few, but still some, viable organisms. Sterilization is the statistical destruction of all microorganisms and their spores. It is defined as 6 log or a 99.9999% reduction. Statistically, this definition is accepted as zero viable organisms surviving.
 
Ozone is a gas composed of three oxygen atoms (O3) in an unstable and highly reactive form. Ozone naturally tends to seek its normal state, exhibiting a short half-life as it reverts back to oxygen (O2) fairly rapidly. There are many uses of ozone as a disinfecting agent. Although ozone does react with organic matter, it leaves no residue in water or on a treated product. Ozone also does not form any toxic byproducts. When used in water, no change in color or flavor results from ozone treatment, unlike chlorine treatment. Ozone can be generated onsite from ambient air or from oxygen. Each method has its advantages and unique challenges. It has been demonstrated that ozone can be economically produced and is effectively used as an agent in food processing and equipment sanitizing, and in water treatment facilities globally. Ozone technology is replacing conventional sanitation techniques such as chlorine, steam, or hot water.
 
We developed AsepticSure, a highly portable, low-cost, ozone-based technology specifically for the purpose of decontaminating and sterilizing hospital surgical suites, emergency rooms, intensive care units and other enclosed spaces such as gym locker rooms, laboratories and veterinary clinics. Since this technology is not considered a medical treatment or a diagnostic device, its development pathway is not subject to a stringent and expensive regulatory review process. We anticipate that the development pathway will be based on independent peer-reviewed science and engineering excellence. Our team is also developing a variant of AsepticSure for governmental use with bio-terrorism countermeasures.
 
AsepticSure is a safe, highly efficacious, ozone based room disinfection system for healthcare decontamination of infective pathogens. Its powerful antimicrobial action is achieved through a patented process involving the interaction of low-dose hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ozone (O3) at a specific relative humidity for a fixed period of time. The compound created (H2O3) is known as Trioxidane. Trioxidane is so efficient in killing bacteria at low doses that all medical and electrical equipment may remain in the room during the disinfection process.
 
Our Queens University research team has demonstrated that even a 3 log (99.9%) bactericidal kill is not enough to stop bactericidal regeneration. Yet a 3-log kill exceeds the results of most current cleaning practices. In our laboratories we have demonstrated that the remaining .1% of bacteria following a 3-log kill begins to regenerate in a few hours and in five days will return to full strength. That is the reason most current cleaning methods and systems have failed to break the reinfection cycle in health care facilities.
 
The AsepticSure difference was first demonstrated outside the laboratory at Belleville General Hospital in Ontario, Canada during the summer of 2013 when a ward that had been contaminated with an MRSA outbreak was quarantined. Following a single AsepticSure cleaning, the ward was free of MRSA. More significantly, for more than six months thereafter, the ward reported no additional cases of MRSA infection. Historically, the hospital reported that the ward had averaged one to two new MRSA cases per month. Achieving a 6-log bactericidal kill with AsepticSure broke the reinfection cycle at this hospital.

The AsepticSure Solution
 
The AsepticSure hospital disinfection system is a portable, affordable, easily operated system that can be used by trained maintenance staff. The unit is placed in the center of the room to be cleaned. Vents and doors are then sealed with an easily and cleanly removable 3M-tape product. The system is turned on from outside of the room through a remote wireless computer interface. The room is filled with a unique and patented gas formula that is ozone-based to specific humidity and charge strength.
 
Following the charge period, the disinfection process is remotely turned off and a separate technology is employed that restores the atmosphere inside the room to EPA standards. The end result leaves the treated room sterile of pathogens with a sweet, fresh oxygen-charged atmosphere very similar to what you experience after a thunderstorm.
 
The turnaround time for re-use of rooms up to 4,000 cubic feet in size is 80 to 90 minutes. This includes the decontamination of carpets, drapes and medical equipment, all to the 6 log standard – the Gold Standard benchmark by which all disinfection technologies are measured.
 
In early November of 2014, our engineering team began development of a new ozone generator, utilizing a revolutionary UV bulb that was proving to generate ozone more efficiently. Following experimental proof of concept work using different generator sizes and designs, we arrived at what proved to be our next generation ozone generator. The new design produced twice the ozone output per generator, while requiring less electrical power. The new generator was also designed as a ‘plug and play’ replacement for our current generators, allowing current systems to be upgraded.
 
In 2015, we had completed our testing of a fully functioning prototype system of AsepticSure using this new technology in both laboratory and hospital environments. The prototype was able to consistently output more than twice as much ozone as the previous system, which equates to being able to treat twice the space with a single system, where two systems might have been required before. Or in the same size space, room turn time is significantly decreased. Like our previous systems, this system was modular in design and up to four systems may be operated at one time.
 
Beginning in 2016, we transitioned all new systems to the Generation III. While the new generators are the most significant upgrade to Generation III, many other improvements and refinements are included. There is a new touch screen for the control panel and updated software operating system; the remote, wireless computer control system has been replaced with a modern tablet, which allows more flexibility in operation; a hard wire port has been added for those rare circumstances when you might prefer to not operate through wireless communication for fear of possibly upsetting critical wireless devices operating in the same area, such as on a critical coronary care unit; there are now dual humidity sensors that cross check each other, adding to reliability.
 
Developing the Market
 
We have demonstrated the efficacy of our technology over the past three years. In May 2014, at the Infection Prevention and Control Association of Canada (“IPAC”) Annual Scientific Meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, Dr. Zoutman further reported that each of the rooms disinfected with AsepticSure at Belleville in June 2013 described above had gone a full year without another case of MRSA.
 
In January 2015, a senior official at Quinte Health Care (QHC), a four hospital Canadian corporation, informed Medizone that following the use of AsepticSure to treat the MRSA outbreak at Belleville and a C-difficile outbreak at QHC’s Trenton Memorial Hospital, the hospitals reported no further cases of illness related to MRSA or C-difficile, citing the use of AsepticSure as a significant factor. Dr. Zoutman reported at the IPAC meeting in Victoria, B.C. in June 2015, that there had been no further cases of C-difficile at Trenton Memorial Hospital as of the meeting date. We believe that this extraordinary demonstration of disinfection efficacy by AsepticSure underscores the importance of obtaining 100% kill of infective pathogens in health care settings if the re-infection cycle is to be broken.
 
During the EPA approval process in the United States, we pursued opportunities in Saudi Arabia, Canada, and South America. Our licensee and distributor in South America is GYD S.A. (GYD). In 2016, we granted GYD exclusive distribution rights for AsepticSure in Chile, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. GYD will lead the regulatory approval process throughout South America and exclusive distribution rights will be expanded to other countries in South America on a country-by-country basis as GYD achieves regulatory approvals and establishes channels of distribution.
 
Following receipt of EPA registration of AsepticSure in November 2016, we commenced implementing a plan for commercialization of our system in the United States. During the first six months of 2017, we will implement a Product Evaluation Program (PEP). This will include placing devices, free consumables and service/support for a three to six month trial and demonstration and then transitioning to purchase. Results of the evaluations will be published and used to develop and expand a key opinion leader network. During the latter half of the year, we will undertake sales contract implementation, which will include on-site training and in-service, as-needed technical support and on-site service as we identify effective sales channels and distribution to accelerate growth.

Regulatory Affairs
 
We have received approval by the regulating bodies of Canada, New Zealand, Chile and the EPA for AsepticSure to commence commercialization of our AsepticSure product and are pursuing approval, with the assistance of our distributors, by the appropriate authorities in other countries. The manufacturing and marketing of our AsepticSure system is subject to the standards of Good Manufacturing Practices. We have not had any difficulty or unreasonable expense in meeting these standards.
 
The regulatory environment, especially in the U.S. market, continues to be dynamic in the areas of infection control as there is a significant financial and patient health burden which regulators continue to consider the option of exercising greater oversight to manage risks given the inability of current interventions to make meaningful progress on reducing infection rates.
 
In November of 2016, we received EPA registration of AsepticSure for use as a disinfectant for animal pathogenic bacteria on hard nonporous surfaces, food processing plant premises, food processing equipment, hospital premises, hotels, motels, and sports venues (stadiums).  Our commercial strategy is to market AsepticSure as a general-purpose disinfectant, as currently approved by the EPA.
 
We are also seeking certification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) that AsepticSure should not be deemed to be a medical device by the FDA. We do not anticipate these additional steps will adversely impact our business plan for 2017. As of the filing of this report, we have not received official notification of the status of AsepticSure from the FDA. We remain actively engaged in the evolving regulatory process of both the EPA and the FDA and do not anticipate any adverse regulatory impact to our current business planning assumptions for 2017.
 
Based on the manner in which AsepticSure is used and the claims made for the product, we believe it should fall under the sole purview of the EPA. The product is intended to be used as a disinfectant on hard non-porous surfaces. The label registered and accepted by the EPA makes no claims for use to sterilize medical equipment and the ozone will not be generated in isolation to disinfect hard, non-porous surfaces. The device into which the liquid product is introduced serves as a delivery system and likewise, would not be considered a medical device. We believe AsepticSure should be regarded in a similar manner to other misting products in the disinfectant class.
 
According to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), which is the legal authority for the EPA, a pesticide is partially defined as any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing destroying, repelling or mitigating any pest. The term pesticide does not include liquid chemical sterilant products (including any sterilant or subordinate disinfectant claims on such products) for use on a critical or semi-critical device. A pest is defined by FIFRA as any insect, rodent, nematode, fungus, weed or any other form of terrestrial or aquatic plant or animal life or virus, bacteria or other microorganisms (except those organisms on or in living man or animals). In other words, the EPA would have jurisdiction over pests on inanimate surfaces as long as the surfaces are not considered semi-critical or critical medical devices. Our intent is to use AsepticSure as a general-purpose disinfectant, as currently approved by the EPA.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Trademarks
 
We have developed and we use trademarks in our business, particularly relating to our corporate and product names. We own one trademark that is registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) and we have filed an application on another. Federal registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered mark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third-party anywhere in the United States, regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs. We have registered the mark AsepticSure® as a trademark for the system with the PTO. The mark is used to describe a portable decontamination and disinfection system for hospitals, government buildings, schools and other functionally critical environments that might currently require, or need to be prepared for countermeasures capability from contamination by infectious biological agents such as C. difficile, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MRSA and VRE. We intend to register additional trademarks in countries where our products are or may be used or sold in the future. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection in the United States.
 
We also claim ownership and protection of certain product names, unregistered trademarks, and service marks under common law. Common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection that is afforded by the registration of a trademark. In addition, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used. We believe these trademarks, whether registered or claimed under common law, constitute valuable assets, adding to recognition of our Company and the effective marketing of our products and technology. Trademark registration once obtained is essentially perpetual, subject to the payment of a renewal fee. We therefore believe that these proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete.

Competition
 
The market for hospital disinfection is very competitive. There are numerous technologies that are competing in a similar market segment as AsepticSure. Ultra-violet light, hydrogen peroxide vapors, ozone based technologies in addition to improvements in traditional cleaning methods continue to make this market competitive and a driver of innovation. Companies that market hydrogen peroxide based products, include TOMI Environmental Solutions, Inc., Steris Corporation, Bioquell, Inc. and Sanosil Ltd. Other companies, foundations, research laboratories or institutions may also be conducting similar investigations into the use of ozone for this application of which we are not aware. These competitors may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger installed customer bases, and substantially greater financial and marketing resources than Medizone. Our ability to compete successfully in our industry will depend, among other things, upon our ability to market and sell our disinfectant system and related services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results or operations, and financial condition.
