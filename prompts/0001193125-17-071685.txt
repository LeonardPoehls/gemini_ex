Our Industry 
 The remote telecommunications industry is highly competitive with a variety of companies and potential new entrants from adjacent vertical markets and the broader value chain. Within the remote telecommunications industry, we serve oil and gas companies that connect to remote locations via global always-connected networks, driving demand for reliable, managed communications services in a variety of environmental conditions. 
 The oil and gas industry depends on maximum reliability, quality and continuity of products and services. Oil and gas exploration and production operators, drillers and oilfield service companies with geographically dispersed operations are particularly motivated to use secure and highly reliable communications networks due to several factors: 
 

 | our customers rely on secure real-time data collection and transfer methods for the safe and efficient coordination of remote operations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | technological advances in drilling techniques have enabled increased exploitation of offshore deepwater reserves and development of unconventional reserves (e.g., shales and tight sands) that require real-time data access by personnel in field and head offices to maintain safety standards and optimize performance; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | transmission of increased data volumes and real-time data management and access to key decision makers enable customers to maximize safety, operational results and financial performance.

 | Systems Integration and Automation (SI&A). Our SI&A segment provides customized solutions for customer telecommunications systems. SI&A solutions are delivered based on the customers specifications, in addition to international industry standards and best practices. SI&A project elements may include consultancy services, design, engineering, project management, procurement, testing, installation, commissioning and maintenance services. Our SI&A segment primarily operates out of our Aberdeen, Houston and Monterrey offices for customers globally.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We previously operated our business under three reportable segments: Eastern Hemisphere, Western Hemisphere and Telecoms Systems Integration (TSI). During the fourth quarter of 2016 we reorganized our business and reportable segments on a products and services basis. The former TSI segment was renamed the Systems Integration and Automation (SI&A) segment. The Managed Services segment consists of the remote communication services that were common between the former Eastern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere segments as well as certain global Managed Services specific costs including our Global Network Operations Center (GNOC) and engineering costs that in prior years were included in the Corporate segment. We now operate Managed Services as one global segment. All historical segment financial data included herein has been recast to conform to the current year presentation.

Our Strategy 
 To serve our customers and grow our business, we intend to aggressively pursue the following: 
 

 | expand our market share of offshore and onshore drilling rigs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | increase secondary and tertiary customer penetration of exploration and production operators and oilfield service providers on our existing remote sites;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | develop and market additional value-added services; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


 | extend our market presence into complementary remote communications segments through organic growth and strategic acquisitions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Expand our market share of offshore and onshore drilling rigs: We intend to expand our drilling rig market share by increasing our penetration of the market for drilling rigs, capturing existing rigs from competitors, pursuing fleet-wide opportunities with major drilling contractors, pursuing opportunities made available as a result of industry consolidation and increasing penetration in new and underserved geographic markets. Because of established relationships with our customers, reliable and robust service offerings and high quality customer service, we believe that we are well-positioned to capture new build and reactivated stacked rigs that our customers add to their fleets as well as to organically gain market share against other providers. 
 Increase secondary and tertiary customer penetration: We intend to continue to scale our initial capital investment with drilling contractors by using our incumbent position at remote sites to serve the other users on the rig: the exploration and production operators and oilfield service providers. We will seek to increase revenue with low incremental capital costs by up-selling our services to other parties on the rigs, production platforms and support vessels, including drilling contractors, operators and services companies. 
 Develop and market additional value-added services: We intend to continue to serve our customers needs by commercializing additional services that complement our wide array of available remote communications services. These value-added solutions provide content Over-the-Top (OTT) of the Managed Service offering. These solutions include Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), IP enabled device connectivity or Internet of Things (IoT), including leveraging our Supervisory Control and Data Acquisitions (SCADA) installed base and cyber security. We expect that over the next several years our customer base will require a variety of advanced services including solutions that improve safety, increase efficiency and enhance crew welfare. These services are complemented by our customized Managed Services offerings and SI&A solutions designed to meet the communication needs of our customers. 
 Through our engineering expertise, technical sales force and operational capabilities, we will continue to position ourselves to capture new business opportunities and offer our customers a full range of remote communications services at different levels within customer organizations. 
 Extend our market presence into complementary remote communications segments through organic growth and strategic acquisitions: Our market presence and proven quality of service offer significant organic growth opportunities in targeted adjacent upstream energy segments where we are well positioned to deliver remote communications

solutions. Targeted segments include energy and non-energy related vessels (including seismic and offshore support and supply vessels), offshore fixed and floating production facilities and international onshore drilling rigs and production facilities. 
 In addition, we will continue to look for and review opportunities in other remote communications market adjacencies that offer significant opportunities for growth and where we are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities such as aviation, government and mining. 
 We are also focused on expanding our competitive market position through strategic acquisitions. As we continue to focus on expanding the target markets for our services and solutions, we intend to pursue selective acquisitions of companies and/or technologies that would be complementary to our existing business. 
 In 2016, we completed our acquisition of Orgtec S.A.P.I. de C.V., d.b.a TECNOR (TECNOR). As a result of this acquisition, we expanded our services to include a wide array of equipment, voice and data services, satellite coverage and bandwidth options in Mexico. These services are provided to industrial, commercial and private users in diverse activity segments from mission critical military and government applications, oil and gas operations, commercial fishing and leisure. 
 In 2014, with the acquisition of Inmarsats Enterprise Energy business unit, we expanded our services to include microwave and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) networks in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico serving drilling contractors, producers and energy vessel owners, Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) interests in Canada, a machine-to-machine (M2M) SCADA VSAT network in the continental U.S. serving the pipeline industry, a worldwide SI&A business and a global L-band Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) retail energy business. 
 Additionally, in 2014, we executed an agreement with Inmarsat to be a distribution partner to deliver Inmarsats Global Xpress (GX) and L-band services to the energy sector worldwide.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the ability to design and implement a broad range of communication solutions using a range of frequencies and modes of communication.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Mission-critical services delivered by a trusted provider with global operations: Our focus on the oil and gas industry provides us with an in-depth understanding of the mission-critical needs of our customers that enables us to tailor our services to their requirements. Our network availability and responsive customer service, along with the high switching costs associated with changing of remote communications providers, provide us with a high rate of customer retention. Our global presence allows us to serve our clients around the world, except where U.S. government restrictions may apply. Our global terrestrial network also allows us to provide quality of service to prioritize various forms of data traffic for a more effective way to prioritize network traffic. Our ability to offer our customers such global coverage sets us apart from regional competitors at a time when our customers are expanding the geographic reach of their own businesses, exploring and drilling for oil and gas reserves in more remote locations and seeking remote communications partners that can match the breadth of their global operations and speed of deployment. 
 
6 
 
High-quality customer support with full-time monitoring and regional service centers: Our MPLS global network allows us to provide high quality customer care by enabling us to monitor the network end-to-end so that we can easily and rapidly identify and resolve any network problems that our customers may experience. As of December 31, 2016, we had 41 service operations centers and warehouses to support and service our customers remote sites. Global Network Operations Centers (GNOC) are staffed 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. We maintain field technicians as well as adequate spare parts and equipment inventory levels in these service operations centers. We provide non-stop, end-to-end monitoring and technical support for every customer. This proactive network monitoring allows us to detect problems instantly and keep our services running at optimum efficiency. Fully managed technology is a key reason why we can support solutions that deliver high performance and new technologies that improve productivity. 
 Operational leverage and multiple paths to growth supported by a plug-and-play MPLS platform: Our scalable, standardized communications platform provides us with plug-and-play capabilities to easily expand or improve service offerings. Our MPLS global platform allows us the ability to add additional services to our standard offerings or change our service offerings on a rig, production platform or energy support vessel with little incremental cost once installed onsite. We can offer these services to all users of the rig, production platform or energy support vessel, including drilling contractors, operators and service companies. We expect this operating leverage to increase profitability as we grow. Our MPLS global platform provides an important advantage by offering higher availability, scalability, flexibility and security than conventional switched transports and accounts for what we believe to be a key reason for the market share we have today of remote installations on offshore and onshore drilling rigs with the potential that we can lift that market share over time. 
 Scalable systems using standardized equipment that leverages our global infrastructure: We have built our global satellite and terrestrial network with a sufficient amount of flexibility to support our growth without substantial incremental capital investment. Our knowledge and capabilities can be applied to remote sites located anywhere in the world. We install standardized equipment at each remote site, which allows us to provide support and maintenance services for our equipment in a cost-efficient manner. Not all of the components of equipment that we install at each site are the same, but the components that vary are limited in number and tend to be the same for rigs located in the same geography. As of December 31, 2016, we leased capacity from 37 satellites, and are co-located in 30 teleports and 34 datacenters worldwide in order to provide our end-to-end solutions. By leasing rather than owning our network enablers and owning the on-site equipment at each site, we are able to both minimize the capital investment required by the base network infrastructure and maintain the flexibility to install high quality equipment at each site tailored to its locale and environmental conditions. We do own and manage the IP layer end-to-end. The standardized nature of our equipment minimizes execution risk, lowers maintenance and inventory carrying costs and enables ease of service support. In addition, we are able to remain current with technology upgrades due to our back-end flexibility. 
 Customized systems integration solutions provided by expert telecoms systems engineers: Through the acquisition of Nessco Group Holdings Ltd (Nessco), Inmarsats Enterprise Energy business unit and the acquisition of TECNOR we provide global customized systems integration solutions through our SI&A business. As the demand for additional telecommunications products and telecoms systems increase with each new technological advance, the need for well-designed, efficient and reliable network infrastructures becomes increasingly vital to remote communications customers. Our solutions are custom designed, built and tested by expert engineers based on the customers specifications and requirements, as well as international industry standards and best practices. For those customers requiring reliable remote communications services, maintenance and support services and customized solutions for their network infrastructures, RigNet provides a one-stop-shop to satisfy these demands. 
 Flexible, provider-neutral technology platform: Because we procure communications connections and networks and equipment from third parties, we are able to customize the best solution for our customers needs and reduce our required fixed capital investments. We aim to preserve the flexibility to select particular service providers and equipment so that we may access multiple providers and avoid downtime if any of our initial providers were to experience any problems. By procuring bandwidth from a variety of communications providers instead of owning our own satellites, we are able to minimize capital investment requirements and can expand our geographic coverage in response to customers needs with much greater flexibility. Our product and service portfolio offers best-in-class technology platforms using the optimal suite communications and networking capabilities for customers. 
 Long-term relationships with leading companies in the oil and gas industry: We have established relationships with some of the largest companies in the global oil and gas industry. Some of our key customers are the leading drilling contractors around the world, with combined offshore fleets of hundreds of rigs, as well as leading oil and gas companies, oilfield services firms and engineering and construction companies. In most cases, these customers have high standards of service that favor strategic providers such as RigNet and work in partnership with us to serve their remote operations.

The ability to design and implement a broad range of communication solutions using a range of frequencies and modes of communication: We have the ability to design and implement a broad range of communication solutions using a range of frequencies and modes of communication. These modes of communication include wired, wireless satellite Ku, C, L and Ka frequency bands, as well as wireless WiMAX and Line-of-Sight (LOS) microwave. This range of communications solutions allows us to offer competitive and reliable communications solutions in a broad range of remote geographic locations where our customer base of leading global drilling, exploration and production and oilfield service customers operate. This helps us meet our customers requirements for choosing their provider(s) based on network availability while factoring in price. 
 Service Offerings 
 We offer a comprehensive communications package of voice, data, video, networking and real-time data management to offshore and land-based remote locations. We are a single source solutions provider that links multiple offshore or remote sites with real-time onshore decision centers and applications. 
 The main services we offer are high quality and secure voice-over-Internet-protocol (VoIP) data and high-speed Internet access. In addition, we increasingly provide other value-added services, such as video conferencing solutions, wide area network (WAN) acceleration solutions, real-time data management solutions, Wi-Fi hotspots, wireless intercoms and handheld radios. The price for these value-added services is generally included in the day rate and becomes incorporated into the recurring revenue from our customers. 
 Systems Integration and Automation (SI&A) 
 As the demand for additional telecommunications products and telecoms systems increase with each new technological advance, the need for well-designed, efficient and reliable network infrastructures becomes increasingly vital to our customers. Our SI&A solutions provide a complete package of communications infrastructure required to support onshore and offshore facilities for the oil and gas industry. SI&A services include the design, procurement, assembly and test, installation and commissioning of communications systems which can include WAN/LAN connectivity, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) for monitoring and security, access control, public address (PAGA) systems, microwave systems and monitoring and control systems. SI&A also offers a complete package of on-site and remote support and on-going maintenance capabilities in support of our customers installed infrastructure. 
 In order to service customers on a globally, SI&A Engineering and Procurement (EP) services are provided from facilities in Aberdeen, Houston and Monterrey. SI&A has the ability to facilitate the end-to-end process of telecoms systems mechanical fabrication, build and assembly through to final testing and Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT). Our workshops are fully provisioned with all the tools, equipment and the skilled engineers and technicians necessary to complete all operations in house, maintaining total control of both the engineering and quality of all the processes involved in the completion of each project. 
 Combining the engineering and service capabilities of SI&A with our other services and solutions such as the GNOC services, OTT offerings, and other managed services allows us to offer our SI&A customers a long-term package of maintenance and support options. These offerings will provide oil and gas customers an opportunity to reduce their operational and support costs while ensuring a highly reliable communications infrastructure. 
 Adaptive Video Intelligence (AVI) and Video Collaboration Solutions 
 Our two Adaptive Video Intelligence services increase situational awareness, which supports a live viewing application and our Collaboration Service Offering, which utilizes wearable remote presence devices. These offerings enhance the safety and efficiency of our customers. These video services allow drilling contractors, operators and service companies experts to monitor the performance of key functions and to collaborate with crews at remote sites to troubleshoot equipment, which can save customers time and money. Remote presence devices such as the RigNet Helmet Cam, patent pending, can send video from remote locations to onshore engineers and experts. This allows for real-time decision making that reduces operational downtime, saves travel costs and improves productivity. We continue to explore additional video-based service offerings supporting remote telemedicine, which supports crew well-being and welfare. 
 
8 
 
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) 
 SCADA systems provide the ability to monitor, gather and process data while interacting with machines and devices such as oil and gas pipelines, valves, pumps and motors. SCADA systems are connected to Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) software and logs events. Our customers deploy SCADA solutions to closely monitor operations when the cost, location and complexity or frequency requirements make technology the best and most practical means of monitoring operations. 
 Wi-Fi Hotspot 
 We offer Wi-Fi hotspot solutions that facilitate access to the Internet by rig-based personnel. This is advantageous for drilling contractors who seek to improve the quality of life for employees by providing Internet access in the living quarters, and for service companies that seek office-like connectivity for their technicians and engineers. The Wi-Fi hotspot solutions provide ready access with a familiar user interface without requiring specialized equipment to connect to the service. 
 Secure Oil Information Link (SOIL) 
 In addition to the services we provide to offshore and onshore remote sites, we also operate a proprietary extranet, known as the Secure Oil Information Link (SOIL), enabling oil companies and their counterparties, such as drilling contractors, service companies and application service providers, to connect and collaborate on a high-speed, secure and reliable basis. The SOIL network is a fully managed, high-performance, members-only communications network hub that enables collaborative partners, suppliers and customers to transfer and share data quickly, reliably and securely. Customers use SOIL services in the North Sea to collaborate with partners and suppliers or for internal company communications. 
Customer Contracts 
 In order to streamline the addition of new projects and solidify our position in the market, we have signed agreements with most customers that define the contractual relationship with oil and gas producers, service companies and drilling companies for our offshore and land-based telecommunications services. The specific services being provided are defined under individual service orders that have a term of one to three years with renewal options, while land-based locations are generally shorter term or terminable on short notice without penalty. Service orders are executed under the contracts for individual remote sites or groups of sites, and generally may be terminated early on short notice without penalty in the event of force majeure, breach of the agreement or cold stacking of a drilling rig. 
Customers 
 We have an international customer base comprising many of the largest drilling contractors, exploration and production companies and oilfield services companies. Although no single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of revenue in 2016, our top 5 customers accounted for 28.6% of our total revenue for 2016. 
Suppliers 
 Although we have preferred suppliers of telecommunications and networking equipment, nearly all technology utilized in our solutions is available from more than one supplier. The standardized equipment may be deployed across any site in any geographic area. 
 In addition, we do not rely on one satellite provider for our entire satellite bandwidth needs except for certain instances in which only one satellite bandwidth provider is available in an operating location, which is typically due to licensing restrictions. This approach generally allows us flexibility to use the satellite provider that offers the best service for specific areas and to change providers if one provider experiences any problems. 
 Competition 
 The remote telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition in the markets that we serve to persist, intensify and change. We face varying degrees of competition from a wide variety of companies, including new potential entrants from providers to adjacent vertical markets and from forward integration by some of our suppliers deeper in the industry value chain, since successful service and system development is not necessarily dependent upon substantial financial resources. 
 

9 
 
Our primary global competitor in upstream oil and gas communications is Speedcast International Ltd., which in 2016 purchased Cap Rock Communications from Harris Corporation. In addition, there are a range of regional providers serving smaller customers. Specifically, in our U.S. onshore operations, we also face competition from: wireless network providers; drilling instrumentation providers; living quarters companies; and other pure-play providers like us. 
 Our customers generally choose their provider(s) based on the quality and availability of the service and the ability to restore service quickly when there is an outage. Pricing and breadth of service offerings is also a factor. The oil and gas industry depends on maximum availability, quality and continuity of products and service. Established relationships with customers and proven performance serve as significant barriers to entry. 
 Government Regulation 
 The telecommunications industry is highly regulated. We are required to comply with the laws and regulations of, and often obtain approvals from, national and local authorities in connection with most of the services we provide. In the United States, we are subject to the regulatory authority of the United States, primarily the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Regulation of the telecommunications industry continues to change rapidly. Our U.S. services are currently provided on a private carrier basis and are therefore subject to light regulation under the U.S. Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the FCC. If the FCC or one or more state public utility commissions determine that these services or the services of our subsidiaries or affiliates constitute common carrier offerings subject to common carrier regulations, we may be subject to significant costs to ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of those laws and regulations. We may be subject to enforcement actions including, but not limited to, fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties if we fail to comply with those requirements. 
 In 2014, we completed the purchase of Inmarsats Enterprise Energy business unit. As part of the acquisition Inmarsat transferred licenses with rights to the electromagnetic spectrum, including fixed microwave licenses, very small aperture terminal (VSAT) earth station licenses, various private and commercial mobile radio service licenses, broadband radio licenses and leases for wireless communications service licenses. Failure to maintain licenses could subject RigNet to fines imposed by the FCC.
 We are subject to export control laws and regulations, trade and economic sanction laws and regulations of the United States with respect to the export of telecommunications equipment and services. Certain aspects of our business are also subject to state and local regulation. We typically have to register to provide our telecommunications services in each country in which we do business. The laws and regulations governing these services are often complex and subject to change with little notice. At times, the rigs or vessels on which our equipment is located and to which our services are provided will need to operate in a new location on short notice and we must quickly register to provide our services in such country. Failure to comply with any of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may result in various sanctions, including fines, loss of authorizations and denial of applications for new authorizations or for renewal of existing authorizations. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits payment of bribes or giving anything of value to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining a competitive advantage. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 508 full time employees consisting of 61 employees in sales and marketing, 80 employees in finance and administration, 349 employees in operations and technical support and 18 employees in management. 
 We have a 401(k) plan pursuant to which eligible employees may make contributions through a payroll deduction. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we made matching cash contributions of 100% of each employees contribution up to 2.0% of that employees eligible compensation and 50% of each employees contribution between 2.0% and 6.0% of such employees eligible compensation, up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Effective January 1, 2016, we suspended our matching contributions under the 401(K) plan. Under the amended plan, we may later approve a discretionary matching contribution. We took this action in response to reduced oil and gas activity.

 About Third-Party Information 
 In this report, the Company relies on and refers to information regarding industry data obtained from market research, publicly available information, industry publications, and other third parties. Although the Company believes the information is reliable, it cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of the information and has not independently verified it. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business has many risks. Factors that could materially affect our business, financial position, operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our common stock are described below. This information should be considered carefully, together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with the SEC. 
 A large portion of our business is subject to the volatility of the global oil and gas industry and the addressable market of offshore drilling rigs and our business is likely to fluctuate with the level of global activity for oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. 
 Demand for our remote communication services and collaborative applications depends on our customers willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the 
 
12 
 
 regions in which we operate or may operate. Our business will suffer if these expenditures decline. Our customers willingness to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas depends largely upon prevailing market conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including: 
 

 | the supply, demand and price expectations for oil and natural gas;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | capital expenditure levels of customers;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | the addressable market and utilization rate for drilling rigs and oilfield services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or non-OPEC countries to influence and maintain production levels and pricing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the worldwide political, regulatory and economic environment; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | advances in exploration, development and production technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and if we fail to keep up with these changes or if access to telecommunications in remote locations becomes easier or less expensive, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. 
 As an example of technological change that could impact our business, some remote communications providers are offering the use of Ka-band satellite service, instead of or in addition to the Ku-band and C-band satellite space segments used today. Ka-band services over medium orbit satellites are already available. Our business may be harmed if our competitors are more successful than us in using Ka-band services to meet customer needs. 
 If alternative telecommunications services to remote locations become more readily accessible or less expensive than our services, our business will suffer. New disruptive technologies could make our VSAT-based networks or other services obsolete or less competitive than they are today, requiring us to reduce the prices that we are able to charge for our services or causing us to undergo expensive transitions to new technologies. We may not be able to successfully respond to new technological developments and challenges or identify and respond to new market opportunities, services or solutions offered by competitors. In addition, our efforts to respond to technological innovations and competition may require significant capital investments and resources. 
 Our information systems and network are protected by certain cyber security measures, and in the event that the cyber security measures fail or are otherwise inadequate, our systems may be damaged which could harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations. 
 Cyber security failure might be caused by computer hacking, malware, computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, cyber-attacks and other malicious activity, as well as natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks and similar events. Such events could have an adverse impact on us and our customers, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers and damage to our facilities, equipment and data. In addition, we could be adversely affected by the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential customer data or intellectual property. Operational or business delays may result from the disruption of network or information systems and the subsequent remediation activities. Moreover, these events may create negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers. In addition, the networks and information systems of our third-party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to the events described above. Our customer contracts, in general, do not contain provisions which would protect us against liability to third-parties with whom our customers conduct business. Although we have implemented and intend to continue to implement industry standard cyber practices and cyber security systems, these systems may prove to be inadequate and result in the disruption, failure, misappropriation or corruption of our network and information systems. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against these events or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by these events or the failure or inadequacy of our security systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The inability to maintain appropriate staffing, including highly qualified personnel, could compromise our ability to effectively manage our business and pursue our growth strategy. 
 Our operations depend on a highly qualified executive, sales, technical, development, service and management team. Failure to attract, recruit, retain and develop qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The microwave network acquired as part of the Inmarsat transaction is a Line-of-Site (LOS) systems and the failure of one site in the microwave network will likely lead to disruption of service for subsequent microwave sites in the network relay. 
 A LOS system operates by relaying microwave communications from one microwave site to another that are within visible sight of another in a microwave relay leg. Although the Company makes reasonable attempts to build redundancy into the microwave system, when a microwave site on a microwave relay is rendered inoperable subsequent dependent sites are also rendered inoperable. As such the risk of a microwave site being rendered inoperable by weather, technical failure or other means will likely cascade to other dependent microwave sites. We do not insure for loss of a microwave site or business interruption caused by the loss of such a site as we believe the cost of such insurance outweighs the risk of potential loss, so the loss of a microwave site or any business interruption could harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations. 
 We have contracted to purchase significant volumes of Global Xpress (GX) space segment, and in the event that the GX service is materially delayed, does not perform as expected or is not accepted by our customers, we may not be able to resell the capacity or may only be able to sell the capacity at prices that impair our margins and financial results. 
 We do not own, lease or operate satellites. We acquire space segment capacity from various providers. Historically, we have purchased space segment, on a regional basis, in contract amounts up to $5.0 million, primarily C band and Ku band. We have historically had multiple contracts with each provider. In 2014, we entered into an agreement with Inmarsat to purchase, under certain conditions, up to $65.0 million of Ka segment on Inmarsats GX system over five years. The GX system operates over geo-synchronous orbits rather than medium orbits. This commitment is subject to a number of commercial, technical and other requirements, which if not met, may reduce the Companys obligations below $65.0 million. This Ka band capacity is expected to supplement a portion of existing Ku and C band services. In the event that the new GX service does not timely come to market, does not perform as expected, is not accepted by a portion of our customers as expected or is not sold at acceptable prices, our margins and financial results could be adversely impacted. The GX system deployment will require capital expenditures to place new equipment with our customers, and if the GX system is not successful, we will not be able to earn the financial returns consistent with prior investments and our margins and financial results could be adversely impacted. 
 Many of our contracts with customers may be terminated by our customers on short notice without penalty, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Customers may switch service providers without incurring significant expense relative to the annual cost of the service. Our contracts generally provide that in the event of prolonged loss of service or for other good reasons, our customers may terminate service without penalty. In addition, some of our contracts may be terminated by our customers for no reason and upon short notice. Terms of contracts typically vary with a range from short-term call out work to three years. Work orders placed under such agreements may have shorter terms than the relevant customer agreement. As a result, we may not be able to retain our customers through the end of the terms specified in the contracts. If we are not able to retain our customers, we would not receive expected revenues and may continue to incur costs, such as costs to secure satellite bandwidth under agreements with third-party satellite communication services providers which may not be as easily or as quickly terminated without penalty, resulting in harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of a drilling contractor on a site can also result in the loss of other customers on the affected site. 
 SI&A projects are heavily dependent on cost, productivity, schedule and performance management 
 SI&A contracts are generally priced based in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on assumptions including the price and availability of labor, equipment and materials as well as productivity, performance and future economic conditions. If these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of equipment and materials or our suppliers or subcontractors inability to perform, then cost overruns may occur. We may be required to pay liquidated damages upon our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts. Our failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for fixed-price contracts or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame and costs committed could result in reduced profits or, in certain cases, a loss for that contract. If the contract is significant, or we encounter issues that impact multiple contracts, cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 

14 
 
The uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. In some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could result in changes to previously recorded revenues or profits. 
 Under our accounting policies, we measure and recognize a large portion of our SI&A profits and revenues under the percentage-of-completion accounting methodology. This methodology is dependent on significant estimates of costs to complete the project. Changes in estimated costs to complete will result in adjustments to revenue. These adjustments can occur at any time and could result in a material change to previously recorded revenues or profits. 
 Restructuring activities may negatively impact the Company. 
 Reductions in or redeployment of resources may adversely affect or delay various sales, marketing, product development and operational activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Additionally, restructuring activities could have negative effects on our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Our ability to retain customers depends on many factors, including: 
 

 | our successful execution of marketing and sales strategies, including perception of our brand, service delivery and customer care activities, including new account set up and billing, and our credit and collection policies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our ability to fund necessary capital expenditures as required by our customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | actual or perceived quality and coverage of our networks;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | our ability to maintain and develop new sites for the placement of our equipment to provide our services; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new technologies, services and solutions that may be introduced by our competitors, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends, economic conditions, and discount pricing and other strategies that may be implemented by our competitors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our failure to retain customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our industry is highly competitive and if we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. 
 We expect both product and pricing competition to persist and intensify. Increased competition could cause reduced revenue, price reductions, reduced profits and loss of market share. Our industry is characterized by competitive pressures to provide enhanced functionality for the same or lower price with each new generation of technology. Our primary global competitor is Speedcast International Ltd, which in 2016 purchased Cap Rock Communications from Harris Corporation. Recently Panasonic, through its ITC Global subsidiary, as well as Tampnet have begun to expand their presence as active providers of communications services to the oil and gas, mining and maritime markets. We also compete with regional competitors in the countries in which we operate. In addition, in certain markets outside of the U.S., we face competition from local competitors that provide their services at a lower price due to lower overhead costs, including lower costs of complying with applicable government regulations and their willingness to provide services for a lower profit margin. Strong competition and significant investments by competitors to develop new and better solutions may make it difficult for us to maintain our customer base, force us to reduce our prices or increase our costs to develop new solutions. 
 Furthermore, competition may emerge from companies that we have previously not perceived as competitors or consolidation of our industry may cause existing competitors to become bigger and stronger with more resources, market awareness and market share. As we expand into new markets we may experience increased competition from 
 
15 
 
 some of our competitors that have prior experience or other business in these markets or geographic regions. In addition, some of our customers may decide to insource some of the communications services and managed services solutions that we provide, in particular our terrestrial communication services (e.g., LOS or WiMAX), which do not require the same level of maintenance and support as our other services. Our success will depend on our ability to adapt to these competitive forces, to adapt to technological advances, to develop more advanced services and solutions more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors, to continue to develop and deepen our global sales and business development network, and to educate potential customers about the benefits of using our solutions rather than our competitors services or in sourced solutions. Our failure to successfully respond to these competitive challenges could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Many of our potential clients are resistant to new solutions and technologies which may limit our growth. 
 Although there is a strong focus on technology development within the oil and gas industry, some of the companies in the upstream oil and gas industry are relatively conservative and risk averse with respect to adopting new solutions and technologies in the area of remote communications due to these services being so integral to highly-complex drilling, completion and production operations. Some drilling contractors, oil and gas companies and oilfield service providers may choose not to adopt new solutions and technology, such as our remote communications and collaboration applications solutions, which may limit our growth potential. 
 Information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting our accounting and back office functions; failure of our information technology infrastructure to operate effectively could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. 
 We depend heavily on information technology infrastructure including our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that was fully implemented in 2016, to achieve our back office functions of accounting, invoicing, purchasing, requisitioning, performing managements analysis of results and payroll. We continue to update and enhance our information systems. If a problem occurs that impairs or compromises this infrastructure, including security breaches or malicious attacks, or problems with systems upgrades and/or new systems implementations, the resulting disruption could impede our ability to perform accounting, invoice, process orders, generate management reports, protect sensitive data of the Company, our customers, our suppliers and business partners, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers and/or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate, including as a result of legal claims or proceedings. Additionally, any such events could adversely harm our legal, accounting and compliance capabilities including but not limited to: our ability to timely file reports with the SEC; timely file financial statements required by certain statutes; timely file compliance reports with our lenders under our credit agreement; and timely file income taxes with the IRS, foreign taxing authorities, and with local taxing authorities. 
 We compete for satellite capacity for our services and any capacity constraints could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In certain markets, the availability and pricing of capacity could be subject to competitive pressure, such as during renewals. There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure the capacity needed at competitive prices to conduct our operations at current rates or levels going forward. The inability to obtain sufficient satellite bandwidth on commercially reasonable terms and pricing could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In certain markets, the availability of bandwidth may be restricted by local governments when needed to support military operations, and in the event of such an action, there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure the capacity needed to conduct our operations. 
 We rely on third parties to provide products and services for the operation of our business. Failures by third-party providers could cause service interruptions, harm our business and reputation and result in loss of customers and revenue. 
 A significant part of our operations and growth depends on third-party providers delivering reliable communications connections, networks, equipment, maintenance, repair and satellite transponder capacity, subjecting our business, reputation and customer revenue to risks beyond our control, such as: 
 

 | telecommunications, satellite manufacturing, equipment or control system errors, faults or failures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | saturation of communication connection points, networks and third-party facilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
16 
 

 | in-orbit risks for satellites including malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies, and collisions with meteoroids, decommissioned spacecraft or other space debris;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | lack of communication service alternatives, including failure of satellite providers to timely replace aging satellites with more modern technology and updated capacities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | human error;
--+-------------


 | natural disasters;
--+-------------------


 | power loss;
--+------------


 | labor strikes or work stoppages;
--+---------------------------------


 | unauthorized access or security risks; and
--+-------------------------------------------


 | sabotage or other intentional acts of vandalism.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 Under most of our contracts with satellite service providers, our satellite service providers do not indemnify us for such loss or damage to our business resulting from certain risks, including satellite failures. If any potential claims result in liabilities, we could be required to pay damages or other penalties. 
 We prefer to use a small group of suppliers and standardized equipment as much as possible so that we are installing generally the same equipment and therefore can maintain smaller quantities of replacement parts and equipment in our warehouses. Although this equipment is commercially available from more than one supplier, there are a limited number of suppliers of such equipment. Further, price and quality vary among suppliers. If the suppliers enter into competition with us, or if our competitors enter into exclusive or restrictive arrangements with our suppliers, the availability and pricing of the equipment that we purchase could be materially adversely affected. If we need to change suppliers for any reason, we will incur additional costs due to the lack of uniformity and need to warehouse a broader array of replacement parts and equipment. In addition, we typically rely on our equipment suppliers to obtain authorizations or type-approvals to operate the suppliers equipment in the various countries in which we offer services. If, due to a highly protectionist country, our supplier or RigNet is not able to obtain such equipment type-approvals from that countrys regulator, we will not be able to operate that particular equipment and our pool of available suppliers will be reduced. 
 Further, significant portions of the work performed under our systems integration contracts rely upon third-party suppliers for equipment and materials. If the amounts we are required to pay for equipment and supplies exceed what we have estimated, especially in a fixed-price systems integration contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a supplier fails to provide supplies or equipment as required under a negotiated contract for any reason, or provides supplies or equipment that are not an acceptable quality, we may be required to source those supplies or equipment on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated, which could negatively impact contract profitability. In addition, faulty equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications or time tables. These risks may be intensified if these suppliers experience financial difficulties or find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to fund their operations or access to bonding, and are not able to provide the materials or supplies necessary for our business. In addition, in instances where we rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of contracted suppliers, there can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide these products and services in a timely manner, or at the costs we had anticipated. A failure by a supplier to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business. 
 Any failure on our part to perform under our customer service contracts due to the failures of our third-party providers could result in: (i) loss of revenue despite continued obligations under our contractual arrangements; (ii) possible cancellation of customer contracts; (iii) incurrence of additional expenses to reposition customer antennas to alternative satellites or otherwise find alternate service; (iv) incurrence of additional expenses to replace existing equipment due to lack of continued availability of such equipment or repair parts; (v) breach of contract claims; and (vi) damage to our reputation, which could negatively affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new business. 
 A significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers and the loss of any of these customers would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We continue to diversify our customer base but still receive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of large customers, among them being Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Ensco Plc, Noble Corporation Plc, Bechtel Corporation, Seadrill Ltd., Chevron and Paragon Offshore Plc. Although none of these customers represents more than 10% of our annual revenue, should a material customer terminate or significantly reduce its business with us, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed. 
 
17 
 
Bad weather in the Gulf of Mexico or other areas where we operate could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Certain areas in and near the Gulf of Mexico and other areas in which our clients operate experience unfavorable weather conditions, including hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions, on a relatively frequent basis. A major storm or threat of a major storm in these areas may harm our business. Our clients drilling rigs, production platforms and other vessels in these areas are susceptible to damage and/or total loss by these storms, which may cause them to no longer need our communication services. Our equipment on these rigs, platforms or vessels could be damaged causing us to have service interruptions and lose business or incur significant costs for the replacement of such equipment. Even the threat of a very large storm will sometimes cause our clients to limit activities in an area and thus harm our business. Increased unfavorable weather conditions could impair satellite connectivity, cause more sites to be shut down and generally cause activities to be limited so that our business may be harmed. This risk is more pronounced for Line-of-Site (LOS) microwave service, as there is a likely loss of service for multiple subsequent microwave sites in the network relay. 
 Some of our stockholders could exert control over our Company. 
 As of February 20, 2017, funds associated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., or KKR, owned in the aggregate shares representing approximately 27.9% of our outstanding voting power. Additionally, as of February 20, 2017, funds associated with Arrowpoint Asset Management, LLC, owned in the aggregate shares representing approximately 16.5% of our outstanding voting power. As a result, any of these stockholders could potentially have significant influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval, including election or removal of our directors and change of control transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. 
 Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. 
 Our U.S. services are provided on a private carrier basis. As such, these services are subject to light or no regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state public utility commissions (PUCs). If the FCC or one or more PUCs determine that these services or the services of our subsidiaries or affiliates constitute common carrier offerings, we may be subject to significant costs to ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of those laws and regulations. We may be subject to enforcement actions including, but not limited to, fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties if we fail to comply with those requirements. 
 In 2014, we completed the purchase of Inmarsats Enterprise Energy business unit which included services, facilities and licenses, including fixed microwave licenses, very small aperture terminal (VSAT) earth station licenses, various private and commercial mobile radio service licenses, broadband radio licenses and leases for wireless communications service licenses. RigNet also acquired authorization to provide intrastate telecommunications services in two states: Texas and Louisiana. As a result of these additional product and service offerings and the multiple licenses acquired from Inmarsat, during 2014, RigNet was subject to more expansive, and in some cases, more stringent regulation by the FCC and state public utility commissions than in the past. As part of the Inmarsat integration process, RigNet rescinded its Competitive Local Exchange Carrier status in Texas and Louisiana and its Interexchange Carrier status in Texas, as well as its international 214 license, to align its regulatory position as a private carrier only. 
 The following is a summary of the regulatory environment in which we currently operate and does not describe all present and proposed international, federal, state and local legislation and regulations affecting the communications industry, some of which may change the way the industry operates as a result of administrative or judicial proceedings or legislative initiatives. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters or the impact on our business. 
 As an evolving non-dominant international and domestic carrier under the U.S. Communications Act, as amended (the Act), among other requirements, RigNet must pay various fees including contribution of a percentage of its revenues from telecommunications services to the FCCs Universal Service Fund and other federal program funds to subsidize certain user segments, file various reports, comply with rules that protect customer information and the processing of emergency calls, and obtain regulatory approval prior to withdrawing from the provision of regulated service or any assignment of authorization or any transfer of legal or actual control of the Company. RigNet is also 
 
18 
 
 subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) and associated FCC regulations which require telecommunications service providers and VoIP providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement authorities. 
 Like the FCC, the state PUCs impose various regulatory fees, universal service, reporting and prior approval requirements for transfer or assignments. The FCC and state PUCs have jurisdiction to hear complaints regarding the compliance or non-compliance with these and other common carrier requirements of the Act and the FCCs rules, and similar state laws. 
 If the FCC or any state PUCs determines that RigNet has not complied with federal and/or state regulatory requirements, we may be subject to enforcement actions including, but not limited to, fines, cease and desist orders, license revocation, or other penalties. 
 Several proceedings pending before the FCC have the potential to significantly alter our Universal Service Fund (USF) contribution obligations. The FCC is considering: (1) changing the basis upon which USF contributions are determined from a revenue percentage measurement, as well as increasing the breadth of the USF contribution base to include certain services now exempt from contribution; (2) the classification of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS); and (3) the classification of various IP-enabled services. Adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our costs of providing service. We are unable to predict the timing or outcome of these proceedings. We cannot predict the application and impact of changes to the federal or state USF contribution requirements on the communications industry generally and on certain of our business activities in particular. 
 Our international operations are also regulated by various non-U.S. governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards and requirements. The adoption of new laws or regulations, changes to the existing regulatory framework, new interpretations of the laws that apply to our operations, or the loss of, or a material limitation on, any of our material licenses could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We may be subject to a variety of regulatory actions that may affect our ability to operate. 
 Telecommunications regulators have the right to sanction a service provider or to revoke licenses if a service provider violates applicable laws or regulations. If any regulatory agency were to conclude that we were providing telecommunications services without the appropriate authority or are otherwise not in compliance with applicable regulations, the agency could initiate enforcement actions, which could result in, among other things, revocation of authority, the imposition of fines, a requirement to disgorge revenues, or refusal to grant regulatory authority necessary for the future provision of services. 
 If we infringe, or if third parties assert that we infringe, third-party intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs and incur significant harm to our business. 
 Third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us, which could result in substantial damages if it is ultimately determined that our services infringe a third-partys proprietary rights. Even if claims are without merit, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert managements attention from our other business concerns. 
 Our international operations are subject to additional or different risks than our United States operations, which may harm our business and financial results. 
 We operate in many countries around the world, including countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Europe and intend to continue to expand the number of countries in which we operate. However, because operations in some countries may be temporary, the total number of countries in which we operate fluctuates. There are many risks inherent in conducting business internationally that are in addition to or different than those affecting our United States operations, including: 
 

 | legal, regulatory and cultural differences that may be vague or arbitrary, lack traditional concepts of due process or awareness of United States laws, resulting in difficulty enforcing contracts or timely collection of receivables and may be subject to unexpected changes or interpretations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The authorities in the countries where we operate may introduce additional regulations for the oil and gas and communications industries with respect to, but not limited to, various laws governing prospecting, development, production, taxes, price controls, export controls, currency remittance, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, water use, labor standards, occupational health network access and other matters. New rules and regulations may be enacted or existing rules and regulations may be applied or interpreted in a manner which could limit our ability to provide our services. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities in the oil and gas industry and telecommunications industry could harm our operations and financial results. Compliance with and changes in tax laws or adverse positions taken by taxing authorities could be costly and could affect our operating results. 
 Compliance related tax issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries. Changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various taxing authorities, disagreements with taxing authorities over our tax positions and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits could have a significant financial impact on our future operations and the way we conduct, or if we conduct, business in the affected countries. 
 We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S. Export Control Laws that have stringent compliance standards for us. 
 We are subject to a number of applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States as well as comparable laws of other countries. We cannot provide services to certain countries subject to United States trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control of the United States Department of the Treasury or the United States Department of Commerce unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations. If our customers move their sites into countries subject to certain sanctions, we may not be able to serve them, in which case, our revenues will be adversely impacted and we may have additional costs incurred as well. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that, generally, prohibits bribes or unreasonable gifts to non-U.S. governments or officials and may be subject to anti-corruption laws of other countries in which the Company may operate or may otherwise have a substantial business connection. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements, and more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. In certain countries, we engage third-party agents or intermediaries to act on our behalf in dealings with government officials, such as customs agents, and if these third-party agents or intermediaries violate applicable laws, their actions may result in penalties or sanctions being assessed against us. 
 Many of our contracts are governed by the laws of countries that may make them difficult or expensive to interpret or enforce. 
 Many of our contracts are governed by the laws of countries other than the U.S., which may create both legal and practical difficulties in case of a dispute or conflict. We operate in regions where the ability to protect contractual and other legal rights may be limited. In addition, having to pursue arbitration or litigation in some countries may be more difficult or expensive than pursuing litigation in the United States.

We may face difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals for our provision of telecommunication services, and we may face changes in regulation, each of which could adversely affect our operations. 
 In a number of countries where we operate, the provision of telecommunication services is highly regulated. In such countries, we are required to obtain approvals from national and local authorities in connection with most of the services that we provide. In many jurisdictions, we must maintain such approvals through compliance with license conditions or payment of annual regulatory fees. 
 Many of our customers utilize our services on mobile vessels or drilling platforms that may enter into new countries on short notice. If we do not already have a license to provide our service in that country, we may be required to obtain a license or other regulatory approval on short notice, which may not be feasible in some countries. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could subject us to various sanctions including fines, penalties, arrests or criminal charges, loss of authorizations and the denial of applications for new authorizations or for the renewal of existing authorizations or cause us to delay or terminate our service to such vessel or platform until such license or regulatory approval may be obtained. In some areas of international waters, it is ambiguous as to which countrys regulations apply, if any, and thus difficult and costly for us to determine which licenses or other regulatory approvals we should obtain. In such areas, we could be subject to various penalties or sanctions if we fail to comply with the applicable countrys regulations. 
 Future changes to the regulations under which we operate could make it difficult for us to obtain or maintain authorizations, increase our costs or make it easier or less expensive for our competitors to compete with us. 
 If during our due diligence of an acquisition opportunity we do not discover legal, regulatory, accounting, finance or other adverse matters and close on the acquisition, it may have an adverse impact on financial results and the ability to operate an acquisition as part of a combined entity. 
 During our due diligence of an acquisition opportunity we attempt to identify legal, regulatory, financial, internal controls or accounting problems that may prevent a successful integration and may include but would not be limited to: Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (FCPA) matters, regulatory approvals or restrictions, pending litigation, deficiencies or weaknesses in internal controls, inaccuracies in financial and accounting representations of the business to be purchased, undisclosed side agreements, undisclosed liabilities, potential liabilities, commitments, contingencies, future cash outflows, identity and role of key employees, state of customer relationships, major contractual arrangements and going-concern issues. If we do not discover material adverse legal, regulatory, accounting, finance or other matters and close, it may adversely impact financial results and the ability to operate as a combined entity. 
 We are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and limitations on the expatriation or conversion of currencies, which may result in significant financial charges, increased costs of operations or decreased demand for our services and solutions. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, 14.6% of our revenues were earned in non-U.S. currencies, while a significant portion of our capital and operating expenditures and all of our outstanding debt, was priced in U.S. dollars. In addition, we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material effect on our earnings or the value of our assets. Additionally, we may incur foreign exchange risk due to certain intercompany financing and other transactions. In the future, a greater portion of our revenues may be earned in non-U.S. currencies, increasing this risk of fluctuations in exchange rates. 
 Any depreciation of local currencies in the countries in which we conduct business may result in increased costs to us for imported equipment and may, at the same time, decrease demand for our services and solutions in the affected markets. If our operating companies distribute dividends in local currencies in the future, the amount of cash we receive will also be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, some of the countries in which we have operations do or may restrict the expatriation or conversion of currency. 
 We have not implemented any hedging strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. Even if we were to implement hedging strategies, not every exposure can be hedged, and, where hedges are put in place based on expected non-U.S. exchange exposure, they are based on forecasts which may vary or which may later prove to have been inaccurate. Failure to hedge successfully or anticipate currency risks accurately could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and may not reflect our actual operations and performance. 
 Market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operations and performance. Stock price volatility and sustained decreases in our share price could subject our stockholders to losses and us to takeover bids or lead to action by NASDAQ. The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to: 
 

 | quarterly announcements and variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors, either alone or in comparison to analysts expectations or prior Company estimates, including announcements of subscriber counts, rates of churn, and operating margins that would result in downward pressure on our stock price;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any failure or inability to sufficiently protect them could harm our business and our operating results. 
 We own, and maintain certain intellectual property assets, including copyright and trademarks, trade secrets, and rights to certain domain names, which we believe are collectively among our most valuable assets. We seek to protect our intellectual property assets through the laws of the U.S. and other countries of the world, and through contractual provisions. However, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property assets and proprietary rights might not be sufficient or effective at stopping unauthorized use of those rights. Protection of the distinctive elements of RigNet might not always be available under copyright law or trademark law, or we might not discover or determine the full extent of any unauthorized use of our copyrights and trademarks in order to protect our rights. In addition, effective trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret protection might not be available or cost-effective in every country in which our services and solutions are distributed. With respect to maintaining our trade secrets, we have entered into confidentiality agreements with most of our employees, contractors, and many of the parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. However, these agreements might be breached and our trade secrets might be compromised by outside parties or by our employees, which could cause us to lose any competitive advantage provided by maintaining our trade secrets. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use, the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced. In addition, protecting our intellectual property and other proprietary rights is expensive and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and consequently harm our operating results.
