ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.

General
Key Technology was founded in 1948 as a local producer of vegetable processing equipment.  We have evolved into a worldwide supplier of process automation solutions to the food processing industry and other industries such as pharmaceuticals and tobacco. We were incorporated in 1982 as a result of a management buyout of our predecessor organization.
We and our operating subsidiaries design, manufacture, sell and service automation equipment that processes product streams of discrete pieces to improve product safety and quality.  These systems integrate electro-optical automated inspection and digital sorting systems with other processing systems that include specialized conveying and preparation equipment. We provide parts and service for each of our product lines to customers around the world.
Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2017 were $139.9 million compared with $120.0 million for fiscal 2016 and $102.9 million for fiscal 2015.  We reported net earnings for fiscal 2017 of $4.0 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $0.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for fiscal 2016 and a net loss of $5.0 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, for fiscal 2015.  Export and international sales for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 accounted for 60%, 53% and 50% of net sales in each year, respectively.  Total assets at September 30, 2017 were $107.8 million compared to $96.0 million at September 30, 2016.
Industry Background
Food Processing Industry
Our primary market is the food processing industry where we apply our processing knowledge and application expertise to help customers improve quality, increase yield and reduce cost.  Our integrated sorting, conveying and other processing solutions are sold to small, medium and large-sized food processing companies for a range of specialized applications. Food processors generally experience thin profit margins and, therefore, are focused on increasing profitability and efficiency in their processing plants by improving the performance of their equipment and production lines. In addition, food processors recognize the value of new technology and continue to demand innovative equipment that improves food safety, quality, yields, operational efficiencies and productivity in their plants to achieve a competitive advantage.
Our strategy is to offer equipment that reduces reliance on manual inspection and addresses common food processing industry problems associated with high labor costs, workforce shortages, inadequate yields, inconsistent product quality and food safety.  In highly developed markets, including those in North America and Western Europe, the substitution of automated processes for manual labor is well underway.  Food processors in these regions typically appreciate the value of replacing manual labor with automated systems and look for solutions that will help maximize yields, product quality and food safety. In developing countries, interest in automation is rising as food processors in these regions increasingly strive to compete in a global economy by improving product quality and food safety. 
Within the food processing industry, the greatest opportunities for automated inspection systems have been in potatoes, vegetables and fruits where the frequency and severity of foreign material and defects is highly variable, depending on the countless factors that affect harvested crops.  In addition, dried fruit and tree nuts are high value products and processors of these products increasingly demand inspection and automation to increase profitability. We believe that many additional applications for our automated inspection systems exist in other food processing markets as well.

The principal potato market served by our systems is potato strips (commonly referred to as french fries in the United States).  Potato strips have historically accounted for a very large portion of the frozen potato products produced in the U.S.  Although we have successfully been diversifying into other food and non-food markets in recent years to reduce dependence on this market, potato strips remain an important market along with other potato products such as wedges, curly fries, formed products, whole potatoes and potato chips.
Other important markets within the food processing industry are fruits and vegetables, including both fresh-cut produce and processed products that may ultimately be canned or frozen for institutional and retail customers. Because foreign material and product defects plague these field-harvested products, digital sorting enhances the quality and safety of the product while improving yields and reducing labor costs.  Our principal fruit and vegetable markets are fresh, frozen, canned and dehydrated green beans, corn, carrots, peas, onions, berries, cranberries, pears and peaches, as well as ready-to-eat fresh-cut salads.
We also offer a comprehensive suite of products that address the dried fruit and nut market which includes digital sorters and mechanical grading systems.  Nut processors strive to produce various products (shelled or unshelled) that are free of foreign material, extraneous vegetative matter and out-of-specification nuts to maximize the value of their product. 
We believe that selected areas of the food processing industry will continue to present opportunities for growth in new and existing insertion points in our core markets and other potential adjacencies.  Additionally, food processing companies are facing pressure to improve product quality and safety while maintaining or reducing prices for their own products. As a result, equipment and processing methods that can meet those objectives and offer lower production costs or increased yields have become strategically important to food manufacturers throughout the world.  We believe we are well positioned to help satisfy the needs of the food processing industry.
Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in the potato, fruit and vegetable processing industries cause us to experience volatility in order and shipment volumes. Cyclicality is experienced over multiple years and is generally dependent upon economic cycles and fluctuations of capital spending levels in the food processing industry.  Orders and shipments are seasonal for this industry and tend to be lower during our first two fiscal quarters of the year than during the second half of the fiscal year.  Other, less seasonal markets that are served by the company include snack, bakery, dairy and poultry products, as well as non-food markets.
Non-food Industries – Pharmaceuticals, Nutraceuticals and Tobacco
Processors, manufacturers and packagers in several non-food industries are interested in automated inspection systems that reduce costs, increase yields and improve product quality and safety.  Our primary non-food markets include pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and the tobacco industry.
In fiscal 2017, the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry, which is served by our pharmaceutical product line, SYMETIX®, also represented less than 5% of our net sales.  SYMETIX’s optical inspection systems for softgels and tablets remove defects and foreign capsules and tablets from the product stream.  These systems are of interest to brand owners, product manufacturers and contract packers looking to ensure product quality while reducing labor costs. We also own a 15% non-controlling interest in Proditec SAS. Proditec, headquartered in Pessac, France, is a manufacturer of automated, solid dose pharmaceutical inspection systems based on machine vision technology.  
The tobacco industry typically accounts for less than 5% of our net sales.  With systems that remove non-tobacco-related material from primary processing lines and threshing lines, we help tobacco processors maximize product quality.  We have an original equipment manufacturer distribution agreement with Hauni Maschinenbau AG, a leading supplier of equipment to the tobacco industry.  The agreement gives Hauni exclusive rights to market our equipment to tobacco processors worldwide, which are generally incorporated into Hauni's processing systems, and makes us the sole supplier of optical sorting equipment to Hauni for the tobacco market.

Automated Inspection Systems
Automated inspection systems are used in various applications to detect and remove defects and foreign material from the product stream and help processors improve quality and increase the value of their end product. Key offers a wide range of digital sorters that accommodate throughputs of less than 1,000 kg to more than 20 metric tons of product per hour. We tailor each sorter around the product characteristics and production objectives of each processor with the optimal mechanical configuration, sensor types, sensor positions, lighting, ejection system, product handling and intelligent software.  Our sophisticated sensors, coupled with proprietary algorithms, recognize color, size, shape, structural properties and chemical composition to detect the widest range of visible and invisible product defects and foreign material.
Depending on the needs of each application, our sorters can be designed with a combination of cameras and lasers to detect and remove a wide variety of defects and foreign material, which is an important contributor to food safety. Cameras are often best at distinguishing color, size, shape, texture and density, while lasers and multi-spectral sensors are better at detecting foreign material. Hyperspectral imaging recognizes the unique chemical characteristics of objects, which allows it to detect invisible defects and foreign material, such as high concentrations of sugar in potatoes, and easily differentiate nut meat from nut shells.
In September 2015, the Company introduced the VERYX® family of digital sorters with the launch of our first VERYX chute-fed sorter, followed by the launch of our first VERYX belt-fed sorter in August 2016. In 2017, Key expanded the family with the addition of two new VERYX models - the B140 and the C70. Available in a range of inspection widths, VERYX is designed to satisfy food processors with small to very large production capacity requirements. This family of belt-fed and chute-fed sorters offers high-performance capabilities for fresh, frozen and dried vegetables and fruits, processed potato products, nuts and other products. Innovative mechanical architecture and intelligent decision-making help maintain optimal performance while minimizing operator interaction. VERYX advancements include sustained all-sided surface inspection and multi-sensor Pixel Fusion™ that, together with the highest resolution cameras and laser sensors available on a digital sorter and an intelligent ejection system, enable VERYX to achieve new levels of foreign material and product defect removal. Advanced auto-learn, self-adjusting capabilities and recipe-driven operation offer enhanced ease-of-use. VERYX was deliberately designed as a modular, configurable, and flexible platform to serve as the intelligent core of an entire suite of digital sorting solutions, able to support a broad range of applications and processing needs.
VERYX complements our belt-fed sorters, Optyx®, Tegra® and Manta®, used primarily in the fresh and frozen fruit, vegetable and potato products market segments, and our chute-fed sorters, Taurys™, Spyder®, Python and Cayman®, which are well-suited for sorting nuts, dried fruits and frozen fruits and vegetables. Our other automated inspection systems include Veo™, an optical

sorter designed specifically for seed corn; VitiSort® for red wine grapes; DateSort™ for dates; Tobacco Sorter™ systems used in tobacco threshing and primary processing; and ADR® automatic defect removal systems used in the potato strip industry.
The power of the Company's digital sorters is expanding with the continued adoption of Information Analytics, a set of data acquisition and connectivity capabilities that enable the collection, analysis and sharing of data across the food processor’s enterprise. Equipped with Information Analytics, the sorter continuously collects and stores a variety of information about the sort process and the product flowing through the sorter to drive more intelligent sorting or generate customized statistical reports. It helps food processors better manage raw materials and optimize processes upstream and downstream of the sorter in addition to improving the sorter’s accept/reject decisions.
Software-driven intelligence, such as our Sort-to-Grade™ technology for potato strip processing, continues to extend the value of sorting. Sort-to-Grade allows sorters to grade defects and length by count, accepting or rejecting each strip to control the quality of the output to a defined grade, as defined by the processor.
We also offer automated inspection equipment for solid dose pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals through our SYMETIX pharmaceutical product line. Available in a range of sizes, VeriSym® sorting systems inspect the color, size and shape of tablets and softgels and automatically remove defects and foreign tablets or softgels from the product stream at rates of up to 1,000,000 tablets or capsules per hour.  These inspection systems help product manufacturers and contract packers ensure the quality of their finished product and are designed to replace batch processing systems historically used in this industry.

We have a large installed base of automated inspection systems which we support with upgrades to extend the life of the equipment and enable customers to continue operating at peak performance as technology advances.  Upgrades often provide customers with a less capital intensive alternative to acquiring new automated inspection systems.  
Process Systems
Conveying and processing equipment are utilized worldwide throughout many industries to move and process product within a production plant.  The process systems group includes standard and custom designed equipment that conveys, dewaters, transfers, distributes, aligns, feeds, meters, separates, grades, cleans, washes and polishes products. Our Smart Shaker® vibratory solutions, which include Iso-Flo®, Impulse® and Horizon™ systems, combine a wide variety of processing functions and vibratory conveying with gentle material handling.  Rotary sizing and grading systems, and SYMETIX equipment for pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, complete our conveying and processing equipment product line.
Our mechanical sizing, sorting, separating and grading equipment is also used in many food processing and fresh vegetable packing operations.  These rotary sizing and grading technologies can remove oversized, undersized and small irregular-shaped pieces of product from the line or separate product into predetermined size categories.  Additionally, this equipment can remove field debris, broken pieces, seeds, juice, fines, and other targeted material.
Preparation Systems.  We design and manufacture systems to prepare a wide range of food products prior to cooking, freezing, canning, or other types of processing.  Equipment in this group includes air cleaners, air coolers, vegetable metering and blending systems and bulk handling equipment.  This equipment represents our most mature product line.  Sales of these solutions over the years have formed a customer base for sales of our other solutions and are also establishing a new customer base in developing markets.  Preparation system revenues include sales of a variety of third-party supplied equipment and installation services, which are sold as components of larger, integrated processing lines, for which we have assumed turn-key sales responsibility.  
Line Solutions

Certain components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from limited-source or sole-source suppliers.  We attempt to ensure that adequate supplies are available to maintain manufacturing schedules.  We may also use contract or third-party manufacturers to fulfill customer needs for ancillary products or equipment that we do not manufacture. We do not have long-term contracts with any of our suppliers. We also rely on third-party domestic and foreign suppliers for certain raw materials. Several of these suppliers are the single source of the raw material. We may be adversely affected in the event that these suppliers cease operations or if pricing terms become less favorable.

Sales and Marketing
We market our equipment worldwide both directly and through independent sales representatives.  Sales by independent sales representatives generally account for between 20% and 30% of our annual consolidated net sales.  In the United States, we operate a sales office in Walla Walla, Washington.  Our international sales offices are: Key Technology B.V. and Visys N.V., which provide sales and service to European, Middle Eastern, Indian, and African customers ("EMEIA"); Key Technology Australia Pty Ltd., which provides sales and service to customers primarily in Australia and New Zealand; and Productos Key Mexicana S. de R.L. de C.V., which provides sales and service to customers in Latin America. We have Innovation & Solution Centers in the United States in Walla Walla, Washington and Sacramento, California. Internationally, we have Innovation & Solution Centers in Hasselt, Belgium; Beusichem, the Netherlands; and Dandenong, Australia. We supply equipment from both of our product groups - automated inspection systems and process systems - to customers in our primary markets through common sales and distribution channels.  In addition, we supply parts and service through our worldwide service organization.
Sales of most exports of products manufactured in the United States for shipment into international markets, other than Europe, have been denominated in U.S. dollars.  Sales of products in Europe are typically denominated in Euros.  As we expand our international operations, transactions denominated in the local currencies of other countries may increase.  In connection with our export and international sales, we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar, which could increase or decrease the sales prices of our products in local currencies in international markets; tariffs and other barriers and restrictions; and the requirements of complying with a variety of international laws.  Additional information regarding domestic and international sales is set forth in Note 16 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
During fiscal 2017, sales to Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. and McCain Foods Limited each represented approximately 14% of total net sales. During fiscal 2016, sales to Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. represented 19% of total net sales. During fiscal 2015, sales to McCain Foods Limited represented 11% of total net sales.  While we believe that our relationship with these customers is satisfactory, the loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.  Each of these customers represents a group of plants under common control.  Generally, purchasing decisions for these customers are made at the individual plant level, which may diversify the concentration of risk.
Backlog
Our backlog as of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 was approximately $43.9 million and $40.4 million, respectively.  We schedule production based on firm customer commitments and forecasted requirements.  We include in backlog only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders, or the equivalent.
Competition
The markets for automated inspection systems and process systems are highly competitive.  We experience significant price competition across almost all our product lines.  Other important competitive factors include performance, reliability, and customer support and service.  We believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to these factors, although there can be no assurance that existing or future competitors will not introduce comparable or superior products at lower prices.  Certain of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources.  Other companies which sell products in certain of our markets include Heat & Control, Inc. and its subsidiaries; Tomra Systems ASA and its subsidiaries, BEST N.V. and Odenberg Inc.; Sortex Ltd. (which is owned by the Buhler Group); Kiremko B.V.; Meyer Precision, Inc.; KMG Systems Ltd.; VDL Industrial Products B.V.; TNA Australia Pty. Ltd.; Raytech Vision SpA; and Concept Engineers B.V.
