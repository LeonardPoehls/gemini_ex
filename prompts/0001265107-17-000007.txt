ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

(a)  General Development of Business

Monitronics International, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company" or "MONI", "we", "us", and "our") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ascent Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascent Capital").  On December 17, 2010, Ascent Capital acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of MONI through the merger of Mono Lake Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Ascent Capital established to consummate the merger, with and into MONI, with MONI as the surviving corporation in the merger (the "MONI Acquisition").  We were incorporated in the state of Texas on August 31, 1994.

On August 16, 2013, we acquired all of the equity interests of Security Networks, LLC ("Security Networks") and certain affiliated entities (the "Security Networks Acquisition"). On February 23, 2015, we acquired LiveWatch Security, LLC ("LiveWatch"), a Do-It-Yourself ("DIY") home security firm, offering professionally monitored security services through a direct-to-customer sales channel (the "LiveWatch Acquisition").
In 2016, the Company unveiled its new brand name, MONI. The new MONI brand will be marketed directly to consumers and supported by direct-to-consumer sales and customer support. The brand was designed to allow custom solutions to flow directly into the home as well as providing dealers with national marketing, sales and customer service support.
We provide security alarm monitoring and related services to residential and business subscribers throughout the U.S. and parts of Canada. We monitor signals arising from burglaries, fires, medical alerts and other events through security systems at subscribers' premises, as well as providing interactive and home automation services.  Nearly all of our revenues are derived from monthly recurring revenues under security alarm monitoring contracts acquired through our exclusive nationwide network of independent dealers or through LiveWatch.
On September 30, 2016, we entered into an amendment ("Amendment No. 6") with the lenders of our existing senior secured credit agreement dated March 23, 2012, and as amended and restated on April 9, 2015, February 17, 2015, August 16, 2013, March 25, 2013, and November 7, 2012 (the "Existing Credit Agreement" and together with Amendment No. 6, the "Credit Facility)). Amendment No. 6 provided for, among other things, the issuance of a new $1,100,000,000 senior secured term loan at a 1.5% discount and a new $295,000,000 super priority revolver.

(b)  Financial Information About Reportable Segments

We identify our reportable segments based on financial information reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. We report financial information for our consolidated business segments that represent more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or earnings before income taxes. Based on the foregoing criteria, we had two reportable segments as of December 31, 2016, MONI and LiveWatch. For more information see below and our financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report. 

(c)  Narrative Description of Business

Monitronics International Inc., a Texas corporation incorporated on August 31, 1994, is primarily engaged in the business of providing the following security alarm monitoring services: monitoring signals arising from burglaries, fires, medical alerts and other events through security systems at subscribers’ premises, as well as providing customer service and technical support.  Our principal office is located at 1990 Wittington Place, Farmers Branch, Texas, telephone number (972) 243-7443.
We are one of the largest security alarm monitoring companies in North America, with over one million customers under contract in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada. We offer:

• | monitoring services for alarm signals arising from burglaries, fires, medical alerts and other events through security systems at our customers' premises;


• | a comprehensive platform of home automation services, including, among other things, remote activation and control of security systems, support for video monitoring, flood sensors, automated garage door and door lock capabilities and thermostat integration, with mobile device accessibility provided through our proprietary mobile notification system (such services collectively referred to as "HomeTouch");


• | hands‑free two‑way interactive voice communication between our monitoring center and our customers; and


• | customer service and technical support related to home monitoring systems and HomeTouch.

MONI Operations

Unlike many of our national competitors, the Company primarily outsources our sales, installation and most of our field service functions to our dealers. By outsourcing the low margin, high fixed-cost elements of our business to a large network of independent service providers, we are able to allocate capital to growing our revenue-generating account base rather than to local offices or depreciating hard assets.
Revenue is generated primarily from fees charged to customers under alarm monitoring agreements ("AMAs"), which include access to interactive and automation features at a higher fee.  The initial contract term is typically three to five years, with automatic renewal on a month-to-month basis. We also generate additional revenue as our customers bundle our HomeTouch services with their traditional monitoring services.
We generate incremental revenue by providing additional services, such as maintenance and wholesale contract monitoring. Contract monitoring includes fees charged to other security alarm companies for monitoring their accounts on a wholesale basis.  As of December 31, 2016, we provided contract monitoring services for over 78,000 accounts.  These incremental revenue streams do not represent a significant portion of our overall revenue.
Our authorized independent dealers are typically small businesses that sell and install alarm systems.  During 2016, we acquired alarm monitoring contracts from more than 430 dealers.  These dealers focus on the sale and installation of security systems and generally do not retain the monitoring contracts for their customers and do not have their own facilities to monitor such systems due to the large upfront investment required to create the account and build a monitoring station.  They also do not have the scale required to operate a monitoring station efficiently.  These dealers typically sell the contracts to third parties and outsource the monitoring function for any accounts they retain. We have the ability to monitor a variety of signals from nearly all types of residential security systems.
We generally enter into exclusive contracts with dealers under which the dealers sell and install security systems and we have a right of first refusal to acquire the associated alarm monitoring contracts.  In order to maximize revenues, we seek to attract dealers from throughout the U.S. rather than focusing on specific local or regional markets.  In evaluating the quality of potential participants for the dealer program, we conduct an internal due diligence review and analysis of each dealer using information obtained from third party sources.  This process includes:

• | background checks on the dealer, including lien searches to the extent applicable; and


• | a review of the dealer's licensing status and creditworthiness.

Once a dealer is approved and signed as an authorized dealer, the primary steps in creating an account are as follows:
1.              Dealer sells an alarm system to a homeowner or small business.
2.              Dealer installs the alarm system, which is monitored by our central monitoring center, trains the customer on its use, and receives a signed three to five year contract for monitoring services.
3.              Dealer presents the account to us for acquisition.
4.              We perform diligence on the alarm monitoring account to validate quality.
5.              We acquire the customer contract at a formula-based cost.
We believe our ability to maximize our return on invested capital is largely dependent on the quality of the accounts acquired. We conduct a review of each account to be acquired through our dealer network.  This process typically includes:

• | subscriber credit score reviews;


• | telephone surveys to confirm satisfaction with the installation and security systems;


• | an individual review of each alarm monitoring contract;


• | confirmation that the customer is a homeowner; and


• | confirmation that each security system is monitored by our central monitoring station prior to origination.

We generally acquire each new customer account at a cost based on a multiple of the account's monthly recurring revenue. Our dealer contracts generally provide that if a customer account acquired by us is terminated within the first 12 months, the dealer must replace the account or refund the cost paid by us. To secure the dealer's obligation, we typically hold back a percentage of the cost paid for the account.
We believe that this process, which includes both clearly defined customer account standards and a comprehensive due diligence process, contributes significantly to the high quality of our subscriber base. For each of our last five calendar years, the average credit score of accounts acquired by us was 715 or higher on the FICO scale.
Approximately 94% of our subscribers are residential homeowners and the remainder are small commercial accounts. We believe that by focusing on residential homeowners, rather than renters, we can reduce attrition, because homeowners relocate less frequently than renters.
We provide monitoring services as well as billing and 24-hour telephone support through our central monitoring station, located in Farmers Branch, Texas.  This facility is Underwriters Laboratories ("UL") listed.  To obtain and maintain a UL listing, an alarm monitoring center must be located in a building meeting UL's structural requirements, have back-up and uninterruptable power supplies, have secure telephone lines and maintain redundant computer systems.  UL conducts periodic reviews of alarm monitoring centers to ensure compliance with their requirements.  Our central monitoring station has also received the Central Station Alarm Association’s prestigious Five Diamond certification. Five Diamond certification is achieved by having all alarm monitoring operators complete special industry training and pass an exam.
We have a back-up facility in Dallas, Texas that is capable of supporting monitoring and certain customer service operations in the event of a disruption at our primary monitoring and customer care center. A third party outsourcer in Mexico provides telephone support for Spanish-speaking subscribers.
Our telephone systems utilize high-capacity, high-quality, digital circuits backed up by conventional telephone lines. When an alarm signal is received at the monitoring facility, it is routed to an operator. At the same time, information concerning the subscriber whose alarm has been activated and the nature and location of the alarm signal is delivered to the operator's computer terminal. The operator is then responsible for following standard procedures to contact the subscriber or take other appropriate action, including, if the situation requires, contacting local emergency service providers.  We never dispatch our own personnel to the subscriber's premises in response to an alarm event.  If a subscriber lives in an area where the emergency service provider will not respond without verification of an actual emergency, we will contract with an independent third party responder if available in that area.
We seek to increase subscriber satisfaction and retention by carefully managing customer and technical service. The customer service center handles all general inquiries from subscribers, including those related to subscriber information changes, basic alarm troubleshooting, alarm verification, technical service requests and requests to enhance existing services. We have a proprietary centralized information system that enables us to satisfy over 90% of subscriber technical inquiries over the telephone, without dispatching a service technician. If the customer requires field service, we rely on our nationwide network of independent service dealers and over 75 employee field service technicians to provide such service.  We closely monitor 
5

service dealer performance with customer satisfaction forms, follow-up quality assurance calls and other performance metrics.  In 2016, we dispatched approximately 330 independent service dealers around the country to handle our field service.
LiveWatch Operations
LiveWatch is a leading DIY home security provider offering professionally monitored security services through a direct-to-consumer sales channel. Similar to MONI, LiveWatch is an asset-light business and geographically unconstrained. LiveWatch customers self‑install security and home automation hardware that is shipped to them by LiveWatch. LiveWatch then professionally monitors all of these self‑installed systems. LiveWatch generates subscriber contracts through leads from direct response marketing, where MONI primarily generates subscriber contracts from a dealer network with local market presence.
Services are provided to customers throughout the United States. Revenue is generated primarily from fees charged to customers under alarm monitoring contracts and the sale of the security equipment to facilitate the alarm monitoring service and other home automation or interactive services.  LiveWatch typically offers substantial equipment subsidies to initiate, renew or upgrade alarm monitoring service contracts. The initial contract term is typically one year, with automatic renewal on a month-to-month basis.
When a customer initiates the process to obtain alarm monitoring services, LiveWatch pre-configures the alarm monitoring system based on customer specifications. LiveWatch then packages and ships the equipment directly to the customer. The customer self installs the equipment on-site and activates the monitoring service over the phone. Technical support for installation is provided via telephone or online assistance via the LiveWatch website.
LiveWatch has operations in central Kansas and in a satellite office in Evanston, Illinois.
Intellectual Property

We have a registered service mark for the Monitronics name and a service mark for the Monitronics logo. We also hold registered service marks for "HomeTouch" and "MONI." LiveWatch has a registered service mark for the LiveWatch name and a service mark for the LiveWatch logo. We own certain proprietary software applications that are used to provide services to our dealers and subscribers, including various trademarks, patents and patents pending related to the "ASAPer" system employed by LiveWatch, which causes a predetermined group of recipients to receive a text message automatically once an alarm is triggered. Other than as mentioned above, we and our subsidiaries do not hold any patents or other intellectual property rights on our proprietary software applications.
Sales and Marketing

General
With the rebranding efforts beginning in 2016 and continuing through early 2017, we will continue to market the new brand directly to consumers through national advertising campaigns and partnerships with other subscription- or member-based organizations and businesses. This, coupled with our nationwide network of authorized dealers, is an effective way for us to market alarm systems.  Locally-based dealers are often an integral part of the communities they serve and understand the local market and how best to satisfy local needs. By combining the dealer's local presence and reputation with our nationally marketed brand, accompanied with our high quality service and support, we are able to cost-effectively provide local services and take advantage of economies of scale where appropriate.
Our dealer network provides for the acquisition of subscriber accounts on an ongoing basis. The dealers install the alarm system and arrange for subscribers to enter into a multi-year alarm monitoring agreement in a form acceptable to us. The dealer then submits this monitoring agreement for our due diligence review.
LiveWatch offers a differentiated go-to-market strategy through direct response TV, internet and radio advertising.
Dealer Network Development

We remain focused on expanding our network of independent authorized dealers. To do so, we have established a dealer program that provides participating dealers with a variety of support services to assist them as they grow their businesses. Authorized dealers may use the MONI brand name in their sales and marketing activities and on the products they sell and install. Our authorized dealers benefit from their affiliation with us and our national reputation for high customer satisfaction, 
6

as well as the support they receive from us. We also provide authorized dealers with the opportunity to obtain discounts on alarm systems and other equipment purchased by such dealers from original equipment manufacturers, including alarm systems labeled with the MONI logo.  We also makes available sales, business and technical training, sales literature, co-branded marketing materials, sales leads and management support to our authorized dealers.  In most cases these services and cost savings would not be available to security alarm dealers on an individual basis.
Currently, we employ sales representatives to promote our authorized dealer program, find account acquisition opportunities and sell our monitoring services. We target independent alarm dealers across the U.S. that can benefit from our dealer program services and can generate high quality monitoring customers for us. We use a variety of marketing techniques to promote the dealer program and related services. These activities include direct mail, trade magazine advertising, trade shows, internet web site marketing, publicity and telemarketing. We have experienced success in implementing initiatives designed to improve lead sourcing for our dealers and for direct‑to‑consumer sales. Providing internally sourced leads to dealers strengthens our dealer relationships and serves as another mechanism for driving customer base growth. We have been named as an exclusive partner with several nationally recognized brands.
Dealer Marketing Support
We offer our authorized dealers an extensive marketing support program. We focus on developing professionally designed sales and marketing materials that will help dealers market alarm systems and monitoring services with maximum effectiveness. Materials offered to authorized dealers include:
•sales brochures and flyers;
•yard signs;
•window decals;
•customer forms and agreements;
•sales presentation binders;
•door hangers;
•lead boxes;
•vehicle graphics;
•trade show booths; and
•clothing bearing the MONI brand name.
These materials are made available to dealers at prices that our management believes would not be available to dealers on an individual basis.
Our sales materials promote both the MONI brand and the dealer's status as a MONI authorized dealer. Dealers often sell and install alarm systems which display the MONI logo and telephone number, which further strengthens consumer recognition of their status as MONI authorized dealers. Management believes that the dealers' use of our brand to promote their affiliation with one of the nation’s largest alarm monitoring companies boosts the dealers' credibility and reputation in their local markets and also assists in supporting their sales success.
Customer Integration and Marketing

Our dealers typically introduce customers to us in the home when describing our central monitoring station.  Following the acquisition of a monitoring agreement from a dealer, the customer is notified that we are responsible for all their monitoring and customer service needs.  The customer's awareness and identification of our brand as the monitoring service provider is further supported by the distribution of branded materials by the dealer to the customer at the point of sale. Such materials may include the promotional items listed above. All materials provided in the dealer model focus on the MONI brands and the role of us as the single source of support for the customer.
Negotiated Account Acquisitions

In addition to the development of our dealer network, we periodically acquire alarm monitoring accounts from other alarm companies in bulk on a negotiated basis. Management has extensive experience in identifying potential opportunities, negotiating account acquisitions and performing thorough due diligence, which helps facilitate the execution of new acquisitions in a timely manner. With the rebranding efforts, we will also begin using our own sales force and internal employee technicians to acquire subscriber alarm monitoring agreements and complete alarm system installations.

Strategy
Our goal is to maximize return on invested capital, which we believe can be achieved by pursuing the following strategies:
Capitalize on Limited Market Penetration.
We seek to capitalize on what we view as the current limited market penetration in security services and grow our existing customer base through the following initiatives:

• | continue to develop our leading dealer position in the market to drive acquisitions of high quality AMAs;


• | leverage our acquisition of LiveWatch to competitively secure new DIY customers without significantly altering our existing asset‑light business model;


• | further develop internal lead sourcing through additional partnership opportunities to support existing direct marketing and acquisitions through our dealer program;


• | increase HomeTouch, home integration and ancillary product offerings; and


• | continue to monitor potential accretive merger and acquisition opportunities and further industry contraction.

Proactively Manage Customer Attrition
Customer attrition has historically been reasonably predictable and we regularly identify and monitor the principal drivers thereof, including our customers' credit scores, which we believe are the strongest predictors of retention. We seek to maximize customer retention by consistently offering high quality automated home monitoring services and increasing the average life of acquired AMAs through the following initiatives:

• | maintain the high quality of our customer base by continuing to implement our highly disciplined AMA acquisition program;


• | continue to motivate our dealers to obtain only high‑quality accounts through incentives built into purchase multiples and by having a performance guarantee on substantially all dealer originated accounts;


• | capitalize on our lead generation initiatives to supply high quality leads with strong retention indicators to our dealers;


• | prioritize the inclusion of HomeTouch services in the AMAs we purchase, which we believe increases customer retention;


• | proactively identifying customers "at‑risk" for attrition through new technology initiatives, including statistical analysis of "big data";


• | provide high quality customer service on the telephone and in the field;


• | continue to implement initiatives to reduce core attrition, which include interactive voice recognition software, more effective initial on‑boarding of customers and competitive retention offers for departing customers; and


• | utilize available customer data to actively identify customers who are relocating and target retention of such customers.

Maximize Economics of Business Model

Due to the scalability of our operations and the low fixed and variable costs inherent in our cost structure, We believe we will continue to experience high Pre-SAC Adjusted EBITDA margins as costs are spread over larger recurring revenue streams. In addition, we optimize the rate of return on investment by managing subscriber acquisition costs ("SAC"), or the costs of acquiring an account. Subscriber acquisition costs, whether capitalized or expensed, include the costs to acquire alarm monitoring contracts from our dealers, LiveWatch's equipment costs and certain sales and marketing costs. We believe our cash flows may also benefit from our continued efforts to increase subscriber retention rates and reduce response times, call duration and false alarms.  For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-SAC EBITDA, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".
Grow Distribution Channels
We plan to expand AMA acquisitions by targeting new dealers from whom we expect to generate high quality customers. We believe that by providing dealers with a full range of services designed to assist them in all aspects of their business, including sales leads, sales training, technical training, comprehensive on‑line account access, detailed weekly account summaries, sales support materials and discounts on security system hardware purchased through our strategic alliances with security system manufacturers, it is able to attract and partner with dealers that will succeed in our existing dealer network. Additionally, we expect our recent focus on internal lead sourcing and lead sourcing driven by relationships with third parties to contribute to the 
8

growth of our dealer network. We will also continue to explore opportunities to leverage internally sourced leads, including through LiveWatch. We also consistently offer what we view as competitive rates for account acquisition. We believe these strategies support an entrepreneurial culture at the dealer level and allow us to capitalize on the considerable local market knowledge, goodwill and name recognition of our dealers.
For a description of the risks associated with the foregoing strategies, and with the Company's business in general, see "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS."

Industry; Competition

The security alarm industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Our competitors include two other major security alarm companies with nationwide coverage, numerous smaller providers with regional or local coverage and certain large multi-service organizations in the telecommunications or cable businesses. Our significant competitors for obtaining customer AMA's are:

• | The ADT Corporation ("ADT");


• | Vivint, Inc.;


• | Guardian Protection Services;


• | Vector Security, Inc.;


• | Comcast Corporation and


• | AT&T Inc.

On May 2, 2016 ADT announced the successful completion of a previously announced merger with Prime Security Services Borrow, LLC (with its subsidiaries, Protection One). Despite this merger, the security alarm industry has remained highly competitive and has not experienced any material change to market concentration. Competition in the security alarm industry is based primarily on reputation for quality of service, market visibility, services offered, price and the ability to identify and obtain customer accounts. Competition for customers has also increased in recent years with the emergence of DIY home security providers and other technology companies expanding into the security alarm industry. We believe we compete effectively with other national, regional and local alarm monitoring companies, including cable and telecommunications companies, due to our reputation for reliable monitoring, customer and technical services, the quality of our services, and our relatively lower cost structure. We believe the dynamics of the security alarm industry favor larger alarm monitoring companies with a nationwide focus that have greater resources and benefit from economies of scale in technology, advertising and other expenditures.
Some of these security alarm companies have also adopted, in whole or in part, a dealer program similar to us.  In these instances, we must also compete with these programs in recruiting dealers. We believe we compete effectively with other dealer programs due to the quality of our dealer support services and our competitive acquisition terms.  Our significant competitors for recruiting dealers are:

• | ADT;


• | Central Security Group, Inc.;


• | Guardian Protection Services, Inc. and


• | Vector Security, Inc.

Seasonality
Our operations are subject to a certain level of seasonality.  Since more household moves take place during the second and third calendar quarters of each year, our disconnect rate and expenses related to retaining customers are typically higher in those calendar quarters than in the first and fourth quarters.  There is also a slight seasonal effect resulting in higher new customer volume and related cash expenditures incurred in investment in new subscribers in the second and third quarters.
Regulatory Matters

Our operations are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and licensing requirements of federal, state and local authorities including federal and state customer protection laws. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards in the conduct of our business.  The security industry is also subject to requirements imposed by various insurance, approval, listing and standards organizations. Depending upon the type of subscriber served, the type of security service provided and the requirements of the 
9

applicable local governmental jurisdiction, adherence to the requirements and standards of such organizations is mandatory in some instances and voluntary in others.
Although local governments routinely respond to panic and smoke/fire alarms, there are an increasing number of local governmental authorities that have adopted or are considering various measures aimed at reducing the number of false burglar alarms. Such measures include:
•subjecting alarm monitoring companies to fines or penalties for false alarms;
•imposing fines on alarm subscribers for false alarms;
•imposing limitations on the number of times the police will respond to false alarms at a particular location;

• | requiring additional verification of intrusion alarms by calling two different phone numbers prior to dispatch ("Enhanced Call Verification"); and


• | requiring visual verification of an actual emergency at the premise before the police will respond to an alarm signal.

Enhanced Call Verification has been implemented as standard policy by us.
Security alarm systems monitored by us utilize telephone lines, internet connections, cellular networks and radio frequencies to transmit alarm signals. The cost of telephone lines, and the type of equipment which may be used in telephone line transmission, are currently regulated by both federal and state governments. The operation and utilization of cellular and radio frequencies are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission and state public utility commissions.
For additional information on the regulatory framework in which we operate, please see "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS--Factors Relating to Regulatory Matters."

Employees

At December 31, 2016, we had over 1,370 full-time employees and over 80 part-time employees, all of which are located in the U.S.
