ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Unless the context otherwise provides, when we refer to the “Company,” “we,” “VeriTeQ,” "VC," or “us,” we are referring to VeriTeQ Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Missouri on May 11, 1993 under the name Digital Angel Corporation, and effective April 20, 2007, we reincorporated in the state of Delaware. On October 18, 2013 we changed our name from Digital Angel Corporation to VeriTeQ Corporation.
 
We were previously engaged in the business of radio frequency identification technologies (“RFID”) for the Unique Device Identification (“UDI”) of implantable medical devices and, subject to funds becoming available, radiation dose measurement technologies for use in radiation therapy treatment. From inception through November 3, 2015, we generated minimal sales revenue and our operations were subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. Our failure to timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC in August of 2015, as well as our failure to pay certain indebtedness that became due, constituted events of default on our outstanding convertible promissory notes, including approximately $1.0 million of senior secured promissory notes secured by substantially all of our assets, and $1.3 million of convertible promissory of notes that were pari passu in rank and priority to the senior secured promissory notes (collectively, the "Senior Notes”).
 
On October 19, 2015, we received a default notice from the collateral agent under the security agreement pertaining to the Senior Notes. The default notice demanded repayment of the entire amount due under the Senior Notes, and we did not have the financial resources to repay this indebtedness. We also received a Notification of Disposition of Collateral (the “NDC”). The NDC advised the Company that the collateral agent intended to sell, lease or license the assets securing the Senior Notes at a public auction to take place in early November 2015. These assets comprised substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, except for the assets described below. On November 4, 2015, the public auction took place, and the holder of a substantial portion of the Senior Notes purchased the assets, including the capital stock of our VeriTeQ Acquisition Corp. (“VAC”) and PositiveID Animal Health (“PSID”) subsidiaries, for $1 million, which was credited against the Company’s outstanding indebtedness to the holder of the Senior Notes.
 
In October of 2015, we contacted the holder of a subordinated convertible promissory note (the “SNC Note”) regarding the possibility of returning the assets securing the SNC Note, consisting primarily of intellectual property and certain tangible property and equipment related to radiation dose measurement technologies (the “SNC Collateral”), to the holder in satisfaction of the SNC Note. By letter agreement dated February 18, 2016, we agreed to return the SNC Collateral to the holder of the SNC Note, and the holder agreed to discharge the Company of all of its obligations and liabilities under the SNC Note upon receipt of the SNC Collateral. In November 2016 the Company returned the SNC Collateral to the holder of the SNC Note, but the holder has not yet accepted such collateral and the debt remains outstanding.
 
Between November 4, 2015 and May 5, 2016, we were not engaged in any operations and our business was dormant. As such, we were a “shell” company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
As previously reported, on November 25, 2015, we executed a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) of the same date among us, Mrs. Lynne Shapiro, and Brace Shop, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“Brace Shop”), pursuant to which Brace Shop became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours on May 6, 2016 (the “Reverse Merger”). In the Reverse Merger, we purchased all of the outstanding membership interests of Brace Shop from Mrs. Lynne Shapiro, and in exchange, we paid (i) $250,000 in cash to Mrs. Lynne Shapiro, (ii) 849 shares of our newly designated Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series E Preferred Stock”), which is convertible into 84.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.00001 (the “Common Stock”), on a fully diluted basis, and has voting rights on an as converted basis and (iii) a goldenshare in the form of a 5-year warrant (the “Goldenshare”), exercisable at $0.00001 per share with a cashless exercise provision for that number of shares of Common Stock required to insure that the Series E Preferred Stock issued as part of the purchase price to Mrs. Lynne Shapiro is convertible into 84.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis. At the closing of the Reverse Merger, VeriTeQ Corporation’s former Chief Executive Officer received 39 shares of the Series E Preferred Stock convertible into 3.9% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis. The shares of Series E Preferred Stock and the Goldenshare shall not be convertible until the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing of the Reverse Merger. Further, once a majority of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock has been converted into Common Stock, then any other Series E Preferred Stock then outstanding shall automatically be deemed converted into Common Stock on the fifth business day following the date that a majority of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock is converted into Common Stock.

Recent Events
 
On November 25, 2015, our company, Brace Shop and Mrs. Lynne Shapiro entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of the same date (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), which closed on May 6, 2016 (the “Closing Date”). Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Brace Shop became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours on May 6, 2016 (the “Reverse Merger”). In the Reverse Merger, we purchased all of the outstanding membership interests of Brace Shop from Mrs. Lynne Shapiro, and in exchange, we paid (i) $250,000 in cash to Mrs. Lynne Shapiro, (ii) 849 shares of Series E Preferred Stock, which is convertible into 84.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis, and has voting rights on an as converted basis and (iii) the Goldenshare, exercisable at $0.00001 per share with a cashless exercise provision for that number of shares of Common Stock required to insure that the Series E Preferred Stock issued as part of the purchase price to Mrs. Lynne Shapiro is convertible into 84.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis. At the closing of the Reverse Merger, VeriTeQ Corporation’s former Chief Executive Officer received 39 shares of the Series E Preferred Stock convertible into 3.9% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis. The shares of Series E Preferred Stock and the Goldenshare shall not be convertible until the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing of the Reverse Merger. Further, once a majority of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock has been converted into Common Stock, then any other Series E Preferred Stock then outstanding shall automatically be deemed converted into Common Stock on the fifth business day following the date that a majority of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock is converted into Common Stock.


Pursuant to the Reverse Merger, we acquired the business of Brace Shop to establish our company as a provider of physical therapy and rehabilitation equipment and products, including orthopedic braces. Brace Shop operates as an expanding online retailer of orthopedic braces and supports for the various extremity categories such as knee, ankle, back, wrist, shoulder, elbow, foot and neck; physical therapy and rehabilitation equipment such as hot and cold therapy, electric simulation, medical tables and ambulatory devices. Operating for over 15 years, Brace Shop distributes their products worldwide to a variety of industries including healthcare professionals, hospitals and clinics, government institutions, school sport teams and to the general public.
 
The Reverse Merger was treated as a recapitalization of Brace Shop for financial accounting purposes. Brace Shop will be considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, and our historical financial statements before the Reverse Merger will be the consolidated historical financial statements of Brace Shop in all future filings with the SEC. In addition, due to the November 4, 2015 foreclosure on all of our operating assets, the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been retrospectively restated to reflect our RFID business as a discontinued operation.
 
On the Closing Date, Scott Silverman, our former Chairman of the Board, and Shawn Wooden, each resigned their position as a director, and Lynne Shapiro was appointed to our board of directors. Also on the Closing Date, Marc Gelberg, our Interim Chief Financial Officer before the Reverse Merger, resigned from his position with the Company, and Kenneth Shapiro was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer.
 
History and Development of the Company
 
We were initially incorporated in the state of Missouri on May 11, 1993. Effective April 20, 2007, we became a Delaware corporation.
 
Share Exchange Agreement and 2013 Reverse Stock Split
 On June 24, 2013, VAC and its stockholders entered into a share exchange agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with VC and the closing of the transaction (the "VeriTeQ Transaction") took place on July 8, 2013, also referred to as the Closing Date. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, VAC exchanged all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock for 410,759 shares of VC’s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $10.00 (the "Series C Preferred Stock"). Each share of Series C Preferred Stock was converted into twenty shares of VC’s common stock upon the effectiveness of the 1:30 reverse split of VC's common stock on October 18, 2013 (the "2013 Reverse Stock Split"). Also on October 18, 2013, the Company changed its name from Digital Angel Corporation to VeriTeQ Corporation.
 
In connection with the VeriTeQ Transaction, all outstanding stock options to purchase shares of VAC’s common stock, whether or not exercisable or vested, converted into options to acquire shares of VC’s common stock, or the Substitute Options, and all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of VAC’s common stock converted into warrants to purchase shares of VC’s common stock, or the Converted Warrants. As a result of the Exchange Agreement and the issuance of the Substitute Options and the Converted Warrants, VAC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of VC, and VAC’s former shareholders owned on July 12, 2013 approximately 91% of VC’s common stock, on an as converted, fully diluted basis (including outstanding stock options and warrants), resulting in a change in control.
 
As a result of the VeriTeQ Transaction, VAC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of VC. The VeriTeQ Transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of VC by VAC under the accounting rules for business combinations, therefore VAC was the accounting acquirer and as a result VAC’s operating results became the historical operating results of the Company. In addition, VAC’s common stock has been presented herein as if it was converted into shares of VC’s common stock at the beginning of the periods presented herein based on an exchange ratio of 0.19083 under the terms of the Exchange Agreement. The exchange ratio took into consideration the 2013 Reverse Stock Split.

VC’s Business Prior to the VeriTeQ Transaction
 
Through May 3, 2013, VC’s business operations consisted primarily of its mobile game division, doing business as HammerCat Studio. On May 3, 2013, VC sold its mobile game division to MGT Capital Investments, Inc.
 
PositiveID Animal Health Corporation acquired by VeriTeQ Acquisition Corporation
 
On January 11, 2012, VAC entered into a stock purchase agreement with PositiveID Corporation ("PSID") to acquire the outstanding stock of PSID’s then wholly-owned subsidiary PAH. Our chairman and chief executive officer is the former chairman and chief executive officer of PSID. In addition, the current chairman and chief executive officer of PSID was a member of our board of directors until July 8, 2013.
 
Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, VAC issued approximately 0.8 million shares of its common stock, valued at approximately $0.3 million, for the 5.0 million shares of outstanding stock of PAH and issued a promissory note payable to PSID in the principal amount of $0.2 million with a stated interest rate of 5% per annum (the "PSID Note"). In addition, the then outstanding stock options to acquire shares of PAH were converted into stock options, valued at $0.5 million, to acquire an equal number of shares of VAC’s common stock and VAC assumed obligations under an existing development and supply agreement and agreed to make royalty payments to PSID initially valued at approximately $0.2 million, as more fully discussed below.
 
In connection with the acquisition of PAH, VAC entered into a license agreement with PSID (the "Original License Agreement"), under which VAC was granted a non-exclusive, perpetual, non-transferable, license to utilize PSID’s bio sensor implantable RFID device that is protected under United States Patent No. 7,125,382, “Embedded Bio Sensor System,” (the "Patent") for the purpose of designing and constructing, using, selling and offering to sell products or services related to its business, but excluding the GlucoChip or any product or application involving blood glucose detection or diabetes management. Pursuant to the Original License Agreement, PSID was to receive royalties in the amount of 10% on all gross revenues arising out of or relating to VAC’s sale of products, whether by license or otherwise, specifically relating to the Patent, and a royalty of 20% on gross revenues that are generated under a development and supply agreement between PSID and Medical Components, Inc., or Medcomp, dated April 2, 2009. The total cumulative royalty payments under the agreement with Medcomp will not exceed $0.6 million.
 
On June 26, 2012, the Original License Agreement was amended pursuant to which the license was converted from a non-exclusive license to an exclusive license, subject to VAC meeting certain minimum royalty requirements, which were amended during 2013. The total purchase price of the PAH assets acquired, net of a deferred tax liability of $0.8 million, was $1.2 million.
 
Bio Sensor Patents acquired by VeriTeQ Acquisition Corporation 
 
On August 28, 2012, VAC entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "APA") with PSID, whereby VAC purchased all of the intellectual property, including patents and patents pending, related to PSID’s embedded bio sensor portfolio of intellectual property. Under the APA, PSID is to receive royalties in the amount of ten percent (10%) on all gross revenues arising out of or relating to VAC’s sale of products, whether by license or otherwise, specifically related to the embedded bio sensor intellectual property, to be calculated quarterly with royalty payments due within 30 days of each quarter end. Minimum royalty requirements, which were to begin in 2013 and thereafter through the remaining life of any of the patents and patents pending, were identical to the minimum royalties due under the Original License Agreement, as amended.
 
Simultaneously with the APA, VAC entered into a license agreement with PSID granting PSID an exclusive, perpetual, transferable, worldwide and royalty-free license to the patent and patents pending that are a component of the GlucoChip in the fields of blood glucose monitoring and diabetes management. In connection with the APA, the Original License Agreement, as amended June 26, 2012, was terminated. Also on August 28, 2012, the PSID Security Agreement was amended, pursuant to which the assets sold by PSID to VAC under the APA and the related royalty payments were added as collateral under the PSID Security Agreement. We had no plans to develop or commercialize the Bio Sensor patents, and therefore, no value was ascribed to these patents. Further, we are not aware of a buyer or licensor for these patents.

VeriTeQ Acquisition Corporation Asset Purchase Agreement with SNC Holding Corp.
 
In December 2012, VAC entered into an asset purchase agreement and a royalty agreement with SNC Holding Corp. wherein VAC acquired various technology and trademarks related to its radiation dose measurement technology. Under the terms of the agreements, VAC issued a non-interest bearing secured subordinated convertible promissory note, in the principal amount of $3.3 million and agreed to make royalty payments based on a percentage of revenue earned from the technology acquired. In addition, under the terms of sublicense agreement related to the technology, VAC made a $20 thousand sublicense payment in February 2013 and agreed to make minimum sublicense payments aggregating $0.2 million over the period from June 2014 to March 2017. The promissory note is convertible into one-third of the beneficial common stock ownership of VC held by our CEO, or 2,148 shares at December 31, 2014. The total purchase price, including estimated royalty obligations of $3.7 million, was approximately $5.8 million. In connection with the asset purchase agreement with SNC Holding Corp., VAC entered into a security agreement whereby certain intellectual property purchased thereunder, including intellectual property related to its dosimeter products, would revert to SNC Holding Corp. in the event of: (i) a default under the promissory note; (ii) failure to pay the minimum royalty obligations; (iii) failure to perform its obligations with respect to commercializing the intellectual property acquired; or (iv) the occurrence of an unauthorized issuance as defined in the agreement. At December 31, 2014, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $5.0 million related to the technology and trademark assets acquired in this transaction, and a corresponding reduction in the fair value of the royalty obligation in the amount of $3.4 million.
