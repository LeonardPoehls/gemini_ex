--------------+------------------------

 
Samson Oil & Gas Limited (“we”, “Samson” or the “Company”) is a company limited by shares, incorporated on April 6, 1979 under the laws of Australia.  Our principal business is the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties in the United States.
 
In 2016, we underwent two transformative transactions. In March 2016, we closed on the acquisition of the Foreman Butte project, which included a number of producing and non-producing, operated and non-operated properties in the Ratcliffe and Madison formations in North Dakota and Montana. The purchase price was $16.0 million (before post-closing settlement adjustments) and following a review of the fair market value of the assets and liabilities on the closing date of the transaction, we recorded a bargain purchase gain of $10.7 million. This acquisition was financed through an extension in our credit facility with Mutual of Omaha Bank of $11.5 million and a $4.0 million promissory note provided to the seller of the assets. This note was repaid in May 2017 through a term note facility from Mutual of Omaha Bank.
 
On June 30, 2016 we signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of our North Stockyard project in North Dakota. The sale price was $15 million and closed on October 31, 2016. $11.5 million of the proceeds from this transaction was used to pay down our credit facility with Mutual of Omaha Bank. The remaining proceeds were used to rebalance our hedge book, following the sale of a portion of our production and for working capital.
 
In May 2017, we closed on the sale of our State GC assets in New Mexico. The sale price of $1.2 million was applied to pay down our current facility with Mutual of Omaha Bank. In June 2017, Samson and Mutual of Omaha Bank agreed to extend both the $4 million term loan and our $19.45 million reserve base facility until October 2018. The previous maturity date was October 31, 2017.
 
We engaged Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc (“Netherland Sewell”) to prepare our proved oil and gas reserve estimates and the future net revenue to be derived from our properties.  Netherland Sewell is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has provided consulting services throughout the world for over 75 years. Netherland Sewell’s estimates were prepared by the use of standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry.  Reserve volumes and values were determined under the method prescribed by the SEC, which requires the application of the 12-month average price for natural gas and oil calculated as the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month prior period to the end of the reporting period and year-end costs. The proved reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.  When preparing our reserve estimates, Netherland Sewell did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to property interests, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and various other information and data.
 
According to a reserve report prepared by Netherland Sewell we had proved oil and gas reserves valued at approximately $65.3 million (before taxes) based on a present value calculation with 10% discounting rate. This present value as of June 30, 2017, utilizes an adjusted realized pricing of $43.64 per Bbl for oil and $1.01 per Mcf for natural gas. As of June 30, 2017, 90% of our proved reserves were oil and 55% was proved developed producing, 3% were proved non producing and 42% was proved undeveloped.
 
Our business strategy is to create a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by exploring for, acquiring and developing oil and natural gas resources in the United States.  Our primary financial goal is to develop profitably our oil properties while maintaining a strong balance sheet, and specifically to focus on the exploration, exploitation and development of our major oil project – the Foreman Butte project in Montana and North Dakota.
 
We became required to file our periodic reports to the SEC as a U.S. domestic issuer as of July 1, 2011. Since we remain an Australian corporation, however, we are still considered to be a domestic company in Australia as well.  As a result, we are required to report our financial results in the U.S. using U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and in Australia using International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).

Preparation of Reserves Estimates
 Our fiscal year-end petroleum reserves report was prepared by Netherland Sewell in the current year. The reports were based upon its review of the property interests being appraised, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sales of production, geoscience and engineering data, and other information we provide to the firm. The information we provided was reviewed by knowledgeable officers, employees and consultants to the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer, in order to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data prior to its submission to Netherland Sewell. 
 
Upon analysis and evaluation of data provided, Netherland Sewell issues a preliminary appraisal report of our reserves. The preliminary appraisal report and changes in our reserves are reviewed by our consulting reserves engineer and our Chief Executive Officer for completeness of the data presented, reasonableness of the results obtained and compliance with the reserves definitions in Regulation S-X. Once all questions have been addressed, Netherland Sewell issues the final appraisal report, reflecting its conclusions.
 
The technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates presented meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Standards. Ben Johnson, a licensed professional engineer in the state of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at Netherland Sewell since 2007 and has 2 years of prior industry experience. John G. Hattner, a licensed professional geoscientist in the state of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum geoscience at Netherland Sewell since 1991 and has over 11 years of prior industry experience.
 
Internally, the Chief Executive Officer, Terry Barr, is responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Company’s reserves report and working with Netherland Sewell on its final report. The CEO is a petroleum geologist who holds an associateship in applied geology and has over 40 years of relevant experience in the oil and gas industry.
 
The reserve estimates are reported to the Board of Directors, at least annually. Our Board members have experience in reviewing and understanding reserve estimates.
 
Estimated Proved Reserves
 
The information set forth below regarding our oil and gas reserves for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 was prepared by Netherland Sewell. 
 
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. Proved reserves are categorized as either developed or undeveloped.

Total proved reserves | | 5,359 | | | 3,565 | | 5,954 | | | 9,982 | | | 8,593 | | 11,415 | 

 
Revisions of previous quantity estimates
 The positive revisions recorded for the year ended June 30, 2016 relate to the increase in reserves associated with the Foreman Butte project acquisition. Subsequent to taking over operatorship of the project, we employed a number of workover rigs to return previously down wells to production. Many of these wells had no PDP value at acquisition date and therefore were not included in the acquired reserves value.
 
The downward revision recorded in the current year relates to our current drilling plan for our PUD locations. In the prior year, we anticipated drilling them as new 10,000 foot lateral horizontal wells. Upon further technical review, we now plan to drill the PUD wells as 5,000 foot laterals out of an existing well bore. The shortening of the lateral length lead to a decrease in the volume of reserves associated with these PUDs.
 
Acquisition
 The acquisition of reserves in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 consists of proved reserves associated with the Foreman Butte acquisition. This acquisition added 2.1 MMBOE in proved developed producing reserves, 1.4 MMBOE in proved developed non producing reserves and 3.7 MMBOE in proved undeveloped reserves on the acquisition date of March 31, 2016.
 
Sales of Reserves in Place
 The sale of reserves in place during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 consists of proved reserves (net of production prior to sale) in the North Stockyard field in North Dakota and the State GC field in New Mexico. All reserves were proved developed producing.
 
Proved Developed Producing Reserves
 
In March 2016, we closed on an acquisition of proved reserves, the Foreman Butte project. This project contributed 4.2 MMBOE on June 30, 2016. Following the acquisition, we commenced a workover program to return previously shut in wells to production. This program accounted for the increase in reserves from March 31, 2016 to June 30, 2016.
 
At June 30, 2017 our proved developed producing reserves primarily relate to producing wells in our Foreman Butte project area in North Dakota and Montana.
 
Proved Developed Not Producing (PDNP)
 
PDNP reserves are those estimated proved reserves expected to recovered from existing wells where there is a requirement to achieve a workover to re-establish production
 
As of June 30, 2016, the PDNP reserves were 1.3 MMBOE. Following the acquisition, we commenced a workover program to return previously shut in wells to production.
 
As of June 30, 2017, the PDNP reserves were 171 MBOE, this primarily relates to wells that require a workover to commence production again. This work will be performed as capital allows.

-

Proved Undeveloped Reserves
 
Proved undeveloped reserves (PUD) are those reserves expected to be recovered from new wells on undeveloped acreage.
 
As of June 30, 2016, the PUD reserves were 5.9 MMBOE. At acquisition date, the reserves included 12 PUD locations.
 
During the year ended June 30, 2017 through further technical review, we changed our plan with respect to the drilling the PUDs. This reduced the reserves volumes associated with the PUDs but did not change the reserve value associated with the PUDs due to a decrease in the estimated drilling costs. We currently have the permits to drill 4 PUDs and have commenced sourcing the appropriate rig and other contractors and equipment required. We are in the process of refinancing our current credit facility which, if we are successful, will allow us to commence drilling our PUDs.
 
While we did not convert any PUDs during the year ended June 30, 2017, we have made considerable progress on their development through the increased technical review and the determination of the most efficient and cost effective way to drill them.
 
Production, Prices, Costs and Balance Sheet Information
 
Production
 
During the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, we produced 298,517 and 240,424 barrels of oil, respectively.  During the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 we produced 147,765 and 569,008 Mcf of gas, respectively.
 
For the year ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 we had one Field (as such term is used within the meaning of applicable regulations of the SEC – See Glossary of Technical Terms) that contains more than 15% of our total proved reserves, namely our interests in the Foreman Butte field in North Dakota, which is part of our Foreman Butte project in North Dakota and Montana. 
 
The following tables disclose our oil and gas production volume, revenue and expenses from the Foreman Butte field for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 and 2016:
 

 | 2017 Foreman Butte Field | 
----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+-----------
Oil volume – Bbls | | 253,168 
Revenue – $ | | 10,697,487

Gas volume – Mcf | | 52,281 
Revenue – $ | | 176,407 
Average price per Mcf – $ | | 3.37 
Per unit production and lease operation costs per BOE – $ | $ | 31.12 

 
This includes $4.69 per BOE of work over costs and $3.50 per BOE in production taxes. We have further reduced lease operating expense in the second half of the year following us becoming operator of the field.
 

 | 2016 Foreman Butte Field | 
----------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+--------
Oil volume – Bbls | | 4,396 
Revenue – $ | $ | 171,138
Average Price per barrel – $ | $ | 38.93 
Gas volume – Mcf | | - 
Revenue – $ | | - 
Average price per Mcf – $ | | - 
Per unit production and lease operation costs per BOE – $ | $ | 44.50 

 
* We took over operatorship of this field which was acquired within the larger Foreman Butte acquisition on June 2, 2016; therefore the costs associated with this field reflect the structure of the previous operator.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
 
Future hydrocarbon sales and production and development costs have been estimated using a 12-month average price for the commodity prices for June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 and costs in effect at the end of the periods indicated. The 12-month historical average of the first of the month prices used for natural gas for June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 were $3.01 and $0.37 per Mcf, respectively. The 12-month historical average of the first of the month prices used for oil for June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 were $48.95 and $37.12 per barrel of oil, respectively.  Future cash flows were reduced by estimated future development, abandonment and production costs based on period–end costs.  No deductions were made for general overhead, depletion, depreciation and amortization or any indirect costs.  All cash flows are discounted at 10%.
 
Changes in demand for hydrocarbons, inflation and other factors make such estimates inherently imprecise and subject to substantial revisions.  This table should not be construed to be an estimate of current market value of the proved reserves attributable to Samson.
 
The following table shows the estimated standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved reserves (in US$’000’s):
 

 | As at June 30, | 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+--------
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
Future cash inflows | $ | 237,490 | | | $ | 373,740 | 
Future production costs | | (91,920 | ) | | | (184,691 | )
Future development costs | | (13,367 | ) | | | (50,752 | )
Future income taxes | | - | | | | 0 | 
Future net cashflows | | 132,203 | | | | 138,297 | 
10 % discount | | (66,941 | ) | | | (71,550 | )
Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved reserves | $ | 65,262 | | | $ | 66,747 | 

 
The principal sources of changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows during the periods ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 are as follows (in $’000’s):
 

 | Fiscal Year Ended June 30 |

Developed Properties
 
Foreman Butte Project – Williston Basin, North Dakota and Montana
 Various working interests
 In March 2016, we closed on the acquisition of the Foreman Butte project. This project includes a number of producing and non producing, operated and non operated wells in the Ratcliffe and Madison formations in Montana and North Dakota.
 
This project consists of 131 wells (both operated and non operated) across a number of fields in Montana and North Dakota. The wells are conventional wells drilled as early as 1980 to as recently as 2010.
 
In September 2017, we received approval for a water flood pilot project for the Home Run Field utilizing an existing wellbore which is located on the flank of the field and which is non-productive. This well, the Mays 1-20H has been tested and readied for injected water following the approval from the North Dakota Industrial Commission. We expect to commence injection in October 2017. The water flood is being used to add pressure to the reservoir which we believe should enhance the recovery of oil. The well performance in the offsetting wells will be monitored to establish the viability of the flood. The water being used is produced formation water so that there is no chemical compatibility issues, in essence the water is being returned to the reservoir from which it originated. Initially this water will be trucked to the injector from the existing producing wells but will ultimately be pipelined.
 
The Home Run Field (aka as the Foreman Butte Field) is the largest area oil field in our portfolio. It was developed on a 640 acre spacing pattern and our engineering and geologic analyses have determined that only 3.2% of the original oil in place has been recovered to date. Given that oil fields typically recover up to around 20% of their oil in place there would appear to be significant un-developed oil to be recovered from this field.
 
This has been confirmed through the use of a 3 dimensional numerical simulation of the reservoir volume, and the expected production curve for these wells has been developed from the resulting numerical model.
 
The current reservoir pressure has also been established using a field wide fluid level study, and the initial development wells will be located in areas of demonstrated higher pressure.
 
Assuming the completion of our debt refinance, we are planning to drill our first development well. The first lateral will test the Ratcliffe Formation of the Mississippian Madison Group. The lateral in the Ratcliffe Formation will help define the pressure depletion radius from the existing producing wellbores which will ultimately determine the number of PUDs (proven undeveloped drilling locations) we can drill in this reservoir.
 
Currently we have 20 Ratcliffe PUD locations identified. The second lateral will test an undeveloped reservoir in the Mission Canyon Formation of the Mississippian Madison Group. This lateral could prove up a new oil field with the potential for many additional well locations (up to 20 vertical wells or 8 drill-out laterals) although we can make no assurances of the results of this testing. A 3,500 acre 4-way structural closure has been mapped from an abundance of existing well control in the area.
 
These PUDS meet the definition of PUDS per the SPE PRMS guidelines and SEC definitions and have been risked accordingly.
 
During the year ended June 30, 2017, the Foreman Butte Project area produced 253,168 barrels of oil.
 
North Stockyard Project – Williston Basin, North Dakota
 On June 30, 2016 we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell our North Stockyard property for $15 million. This transaction closed on October 31, 2016.
 
State GC Oil and Gas Field, New Mexico
The State GC Oil and Gas Field, located in Lea County, New Mexico, was discovered in 1980 and covers approximately 600 acres.  The field is operated by Legacy Resources.
 
The State GC# 1 well was drilled in 1980 and has been productive since that time.
 
This project was sold for $1.2 million on April 30, 2017.

Davis Bintliff #1 Well (Sabretooth Prospect), Brazoria County, Texas  
 12.5% Working Interest before payout, 9.375% Working Interest after payout
 
This well is operated by Davis Holdings. The Davis Bintliff #1 well was completed at the end of October 2008.  
 
During the year, this well encountered operational issues and was plugged and abandoned. 
 
Exploration / Undeveloped Properties
 
Hawk Springs Project, Goshen County, Wyoming
 37.5% -100% working interest
 
Spirit of America US 34 #2-29 (Spirit of America II)
 100% working interest
 The Spirit of America I replacement well, Spirit of America II, was drilled to a total depth of 10,634 feet using a conservative drilling approach to penetrate the troublesome salt section along with heavy weight, oil based mud. Numerous operational difficulties were encountered and the well failed to produce economic quantities of hydrocarbons. $7.3 million in costs associated to drill this well, were written off to the Statement of Operations in the year ended June 30, 2013.
 
In July 2015, a workover rig was moved to the location to test the Dakota formation from 8,054 feet to 8,064 feet. This formation was found to be water saturated and no hydrocarbons were noted. All costs associated with this well have been written off to the Income Statement during the year ended June 30, 2016.
 
This well was plugged in October 2016.
 
Defender US 33 #2-29H
 37.5% working interest
 This well commenced production in February 2012 and has experienced numerous operational and pumping issues. In July 2012, the well was cleaned out and resumed pumping. In June 2015, the well was struck by lightning which affected the electronic controllers associated with the well. These controllers have yet to be repaired due to the well’s low productivity rate.
 
There was no production from this well during the year ended June 30, 2016. This well was plugged in October 2016.
 
Bluff 1-11 (25% working interest)
 During the year ended June 30, 2014 we drilled the Bluff Prospect to test multiple targets in the Permian and Pennsylvanian sections in a 4-way structural trapping configuration. The Bluff #1-11 well reached a total depth of 8,900 feet after intersecting the pre-Cambrian basement on June 13, 2014.
 
To date, this well has failed to produce economic quantities of hydrocarbons and all costs associated with drilling it have been written off the Statement of Operations. The well is yet to be plugged as we are waiting on testing the upper canyon spring zone with a perforation and swab test. This operation is expected to cost $20,000, net to us. This operation is not currently planned.
 
Roosevelt Project, Roosevelt County, Montana
 100% Working Interest
 
Australia II
 100% working interest
 In December 2011, we drilled Australia II in the Roosevelt Project, our first appraisal (exploratory) well in this project area. This well was drilled to a total measured depth of 14,972 feet with the horizontal lateral remaining within the target zone for the entire lateral length. Oil and gas shows were returned during the drilling of this well and approximately 3,425 barrels of oil were produced. This well was being pumped, and although this well is productive, we do not presently believe that we will be able to recover our costs associated with drilling it. We expensed $13.1 million of previously capitalized exploration expenditure in the Statement of Operations as deferred exploration expenditure written off, which represents 100% of the costs incurred to June 30, 2012.

--

 

In July 2014, we replaced the pump on the Australia II well and production from this well has recommenced production. During July 2014, the well averaged 100 barrels of oil per day. Following the continued decline in the oil price, this well was shut in from January 2015 to August 2016. It has no reserves associated with it at June 30, 2016.
 
This well was put back on production in August 2016 and produced at an average rate of 66 BOEPD.

During the year ended June 30, 2013, we acquired, in two tranches, a net 950 acres in two 1,280 acre drilling units located in the Rainbow Project, Williams County, North Dakota. The Rainbow Project is located in Sections 17, 18, 19 and 20 in T158N R99W.
 
The acquisition involved an acreage trade by the parties and a future carry of the vendor by us in the initial drilling program on the Rainbow Project. We transferred 160 net acres from our 1,200 acre undeveloped acreage holding in North Stockyard and the vendor will fund its share (between 7.5% and 8.5%) of the North Stockyard initial infill program. We have acquired 950 net acres in the Rainbow Project from the vendor for this acreage trade and have paid $1 million to the vendor, in lieu of a carry as we did not spud a well within the desired time frame. $0.6 million of this payment was made prior to June 30, 2015 with the remaining $0.4 million paid subsequent to year end.
 
In the western drilling unit of the acquired acreage, we hold a 52.21% working interest. In the eastern drilling unit, our interest is 23%.
 
Our first Rainbow well, Gladys 1-20, drilled by Continental Resources, spud on June 28, 2014 and was drilled to a total depth of 19,994 feet. The well is 1,280 acre lateral (approximately 10,000 feet) in the middle member of the Bakken formation. The well produced 4,302 net barrels of oil during the year ended June 30, 2017.
 
There has been no further drilling activity on this lease during the year ended June 30, 2017 and 652 acres have expired.
 
Cane Creek Project, Grand & San Juan Counties, Utah
 Pennsylvanian Paradox Formation, Paradox Basin
 100% working interest
 On November 5, 2014, we entered into an Other Business Arrangement (“OBA”) with the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (“SITLA”) covering approximately 8,080 gross/net acres located in Grand and San Juan Counties, Utah, all of which are administered by SITLA. We were granted an option period for two years, expiring November 30th, 2016 in order to enter into a Multiple Mineral Development Agreement (“MMDA”) with another company who hold leases to extract potash in an acreage position situated within our project area. Upon entering into the MMDA, SITLA is obligated to deliver oil and gas leases covering our project area at a cost of $75 per acre to us. The MMDA has been finalized though it has not yet been executed. We are currently in the process of seeking farm out partners to move this project forward. We paid an additional option fee in November 2016 to extend our option to November 30th, 2017.
 
This acreage is located in the heart of the Cane Creek Clastic Play of the Paradox Formation along the Cane Creek anticline. The primary drilling objective is the overpressured and oil saturated Cane Creek Clastic interval. Keys to the play to date include positioning along the axis of the Cane Creek anticline and exposure to open natural fractures. A 3-D seismic is currently being designed to image these natural fractures. This project displays very robust economics in a low priced oil environment using the evidence obtained from a nearby competitor well. Initial production rates from a well drilled by a competitor are around 1,500 BOPD and decline rates are very modest, as experienced by competitor wells in the area. We have not drilled a well in this area to date.
 
 Risk and Insurance Program
 
Our operations are subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including the risk of well blowouts, oil spills and other adverse events. We could be held responsible for injuries suffered by third parties, contamination, property damage or other losses resulting from these types of events. In addition, we have generally agreed to indemnify our drilling rig contractors against certain of these types of losses. Because of these risks, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the potential risks affecting our operations and in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be economic. Our insurance program is designed to provide us with what we believe to be an economically appropriate level of financial protection from significant unfavorable losses resulting from damages to, or the loss of, physical assets or loss of human life or liability claims of third parties, attributed to certain assets and including such occurrences as well blowouts and resulting oil spills. We regularly review our risks of loss and the cost and availability of insurance and consider the need to revise our insurance program accordingly. Our insurance coverage includes deductibles which must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.

In general, our current insurance policies covering a blowout or other insurable incident resulting in damage to one of our oil and gas wells provide up to $20 million of well control, pollution cleanup and consequential damages coverage and $11 million of third party liability coverage for additional pollution cleanup and consequential damages, which also covers personal injury and death.
 
If a well blowout, spill or similar event occurs that is not covered by insurance or not fully protected by insured limits, we would be responsible for the costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
Marketing, Major Customers and Delivery Commitments
 
Markets for oil and natural gas are volatile and are subject to wide fluctuations depending on numerous factors beyond our control, including seasonality, economic conditions, foreign imports, political conditions in other energy producing countries, OPEC market actions, and domestic government regulations and policies. Substantially all of our production is sold pursuant to agreements with pricing based on prevailing commodity prices, subject to adjustment for regional differentials and similar factors. These contracts are generally set up on a month to month basis and can be cancelled at any time by either party giving 30 days notice. We had no material delivery commitments as of September 26, 2017.
Regulatory Environment
 
Our oil and gas exploration, production, and related operations are subject to numerous and frequently changing federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These regulations relate to, among other things, environmental and land-use matters, conservation, safety, pipeline use, drilling and spacing of wells, well stimulation, transportation, and forced pooling and protection of correlative rights among interest owners. Environmental laws and regulations may require the acquisition of certain permits prior to or in connection with our activities and operations. In addition, they may restrict or prohibit the types, quantities, and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment, including releases from drilling and production operations, and restrict or prohibit drilling or other operations that could impact wetlands, endangered or threatened species or other protected areas or natural resources. Following is a summary of some key statutory and regulatory programs that affect our operations.
 
Regulation of Oil and Gas
 
Certain regulations may govern the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the rates of production or “allowables,” the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, and the notification of surface owners and other third parties. Certain laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. We also are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to Native American tribal surface ownership, Native American oil and gas leases and other exploration agreements, fees, taxes, or other burdens, obligations, and issues unique to oil and gas ownership and operations within Native American reservations.
 
Environmental and Land Use Regulation
 
A wide variety of environmental and land-use regulations apply to companies engaged in the production and sale of oil and natural gas. These regulations have been changed frequently in the past and, in general, these changes have imposed more stringent requirements that increase operating costs and/or require capital expenditures to remain in compliance. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and/or criminal penalties and liability for non-compliance, clean-up costs and other environmental and natural resource damages. It also is possible that unanticipated developments or changes in the law could require us to make environmental expenditures significantly greater than those we currently expect.

Discharges to Waters. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended (the “Clean Water Act”), and comparable state statutes impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of “pollutants,” which include dredge and fill material, produced waters, various oil and natural gas wastes, including drilling fluids, drill cuttings, and other substances. Discharge of such pollutants into wetlands, onshore (streams, rivers, etc.), coastal and offshore waters without appropriate permits is prohibited. These controls generally have become more stringent over time, and it is possible that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future. Violation of the Clean Water Act and similar state regulatory programs can result in civil, criminal and administrative penalties for the unauthorized discharges of pollutants. Violations also put operators at risk of citizen lawsuits under the Clean Water Act, seeking both enforcement of the Clean Water Act’s provisions and civil penalties and litigation costs. Operators may also face substantial liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with improper discharges of pollutants.
 
The Clean Water Act also regulates stormwater discharges from industrial properties and construction sites, and requires permits and the implementation of site-specific Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans (“SWPPPs”), best management practices, training, and periodic monitoring of covered activities. Certain operations also are required to develop and implement Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (“SPCC”) plans, and in some circumstances, facility response plans to address potential oil and produced water spills. Certain exemptions from some Clean Water Act requirements were created or broadened pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
 
The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990 places strict liability for oil spills on the "responsible party," which it defines for onshore facilities as the owner or operator of a facility or pipeline. Strict liability means liability without fault. The OPA provides for the recovery of cleanup and removal costs, and also recognizes as recoverable damages the loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity due to the injury to natural resources caused by an oil spill. Further, a federal, state, foreign government, or Indian tribe trustee may recover damages for injury to natural resources, including the reasonable cost of assessing the damage. Finally, federal and state governments may also recover damages for the loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees, or profits brought about by injury to property or natural resources. We may be subject to strict liability under OPA for all or part of the costs of cleaning up oil spills from our facilities and for natural resource damages. We have not, to our knowledge, been identified as a responsible party under OPA, nor are we aware of any prior owners or operators of our properties that have been so identified with respect to their operation of those properties.
 
Safe Drinking Water Act – Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or the SDWA, is the main federal law that authorizes the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to set standards for drinking water quality and oversee the states, localities, and water suppliers who implement those standards. The Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program under the SDWA is responsible for regulating the construction, operation, permitting, and closure of injection wells that place fluids underground. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 currently excludes hydraulic fracturing from regulation by the SDWA. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that creates a fracture extending from a well bore into a low-permeability rock formation to enable oil or natural gas to move more easily to a production well. Hydraulic fractures typically are created through the injection of water, sand and chemicals into the rock formation.
 
The United States Congress has on multiple occasions considered, and may in the future consider, legislation such as the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, or the FRAC Act, to amend the SDWA to repeal this exemption. However, Congress has not taken any significant action on such legislation. A version of the FRAC Act was introduced in 2017, but remains in the first stages of the legislative process. If enacted as currently proposed, the FRAC Act would amend the definition of “underground injection” in the SDWA to encompass hydraulic fracturing activities. Such a provision could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, including disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. The FRAC Act’s proposal to require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. It is not possible to predict whether a future session of Congress may act further on hydraulic fracturing legislation. Such legislation, if adopted, could establish additional regulation and permitting requirements at the federal level.

In addition, in March 2010, at the request of the U.S. Congress, EPA announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water resources. A progress report was released in December 2012. In May 2014, the EPA indicated that as a first step, it would convene a stakeholder process to develop an approach to obtain information on chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. To gather information to inform EPA's proposal, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) and initiated a public participation process to seek comment on the information that should be reported or disclosed for hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures and the mechanism for obtaining this information. EPA issued a draft report in June 2015, concluding that, although hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources through water withdrawals, spills, fracturing directly into such resources, underground migration of liquids and gases, and inadequate treatment and discharge of wastewater, EPA did not find evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States. EPA finalized the report in December 2016, after considering public comments on the draft report. The key findings remain largely unchanged from the draft report, although EPA noted in the final report that data gaps and uncertainties limited EPA’s ability to fully assess the potential impacts on drinking water resources locally and nationally.
 
Hydraulic fracturing currently is regulated primarily at the state level. Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Texas, and New Mexico recently enacted rules to regulate certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These regulations generally require companies to disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations, as well as the concentrations of those chemicals, on a well-by-well basis, either prior to or following well completion, depending on which state’s regulations apply.
 
Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to local, state and federal regulations governing emissions of air pollutants. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally based permitting requirements. Producing wells, natural gas plants and electric generating facilities all generate volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and nitrous oxides. Civil and administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits generally are resolved by payment of monetary fines, performance of mitigation projects to offset excess emissions and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could require us to forego construction, modification or operation of certain air-emission sources.
 
In April 2012, EPA issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that among other things, requires operators to capture 95 percent of the volatile organic compounds (“VOC”) emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. The reduction in VOC emissions is accomplished primarily through the use of “reduced emissions completion” or “green completion” methods to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air. EPA also issued regulations that set requirements for VOC emissions from several types of equipment, including storage tanks, compressors, dehydrators, and valves. In June 2016, EPA issued additional regulations specific to the oil and gas industry adding methane standards for equipment and processes covered by the 2012 regulations. The 2016 final regulations also add leak detection and repair (LDAR) requirements for equipment such as valves, connectors, pressure relief valves, open-ended lines, access doors, flanges, crank case vents, pump seals or diaphragms, closed vent systems, compressors, separators, dehydrators, thief hatches on storage tanks, and sweetening units at gas processing plants. On April 19, 2017, EPA announced its intent to administratively reconsider the methane rules, staying a June 3, 2017 effective date for certain provisions—such as the LDAR provisions—for 90 days. Petitioners filed a petition to stop the administrative stay in the D.C. Circuit, and on July 3, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted relief for the petitioners, which had the impact of making the previously-stayed rules effective. While EPA reconsiders the methane rule, it will remain effective. These new regulations, or the adoption of any other laws or regulations restricting or reducing these emissions, will increase our operating costs.
 
Another regulatory development that may impact our operations is EPA’s notice of finding and determination that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to human health and the environment.  In response to that finding, EPA has implemented GHG-related reporting, monitoring, and recordkeeping rules for petroleum and natural gas systems, among other industries, and developed a Climate Action Plan, including a Methane Strategy which formed the basis for methane regulations issued in June 2016. However, the Executive Office report calling for the Climate Action Plan and Methane Strategy was rescinded by President Trump by Executive Order 13,783, and the June 2016 methane regulations, though currently effective, are slated for review and possible revision or repeal by EPA. A brief EPA administrative stay of certain portions of the methane regulations was vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in July 2017, but EPA has solicited comment on a proposed two-year stay of those methane rules. Those methane regulations remain in effect until possible revision or repeal by separate EPA rulemaking in the future, which action is also likely to be challenged in the courts. While the U.S. Congress has considered, and may in the future again consider, “cap and trade” legislation that would establish an economy-wide cap on emissions of GHGs in the United States and would require most sources of GHG emissions to obtain GHG emission “allowances” to continue their operations, the current administration’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate accords, announced on June 1, 2017, makes that less likely in the near term. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs would be likely to increase our operating costs and could also have an adverse effect on demand for our production.
 
Waste Disposal. We currently own or lease a number of properties that have been used for production of oil and natural gas for many years. Although we believe the prior owners and/or operators of those properties generally utilized operating and disposal practices that met applicable standards in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties we currently own or lease. State and federal laws applicable to oil and natural gas wastes have become more stringent over time. Under new and existing laws, we could be required to remediate property, including groundwater, containing or impacted by previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or to perform remedial well-plugging operations to prevent future, or mitigate existing, contamination.

We may generate wastes, including “solid” wastes and “hazardous” wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, although certain oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) wastes currently are excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. On May 4, 2016, several environmental groups filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court for the District of Columbia seeking to compel the EPA to review the exemption of E&P wastes under RCRA. The groups had previously filed a Notice of Intent to Sue (“NOI”) EPA in August 2015 for failure to act on a 2010 petition to review the E&P RCRA exemption. In late December 2016, EPA entered into a consent decree with the environmental groups and agreed to reconsider the Agency’s current treatment of E&P wastes. The District Court approved the consent decree, binding EPA to a court-imposed timeline for determining how oil and gas wastes should be regulated under RCRA. EPA has until March 2019 to make its determination. If E&P waste becomes regulated as hazardous waste, then generators, transporters, and owners/operators of disposal and treatment facilities will be subject to RCRA regulations at significant increased cost. Thus, it is possible that certain wastes generated by our oil and natural gas operations that currently are excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes, and may therefore become subject to more rigorous and costly management, disposal and clean-up requirements. State and federal oil and natural gas regulations also provide guidelines for the storage and disposal of solid wastes resulting from the production of oil and natural gas, both onshore and offshore.
 
Superfund. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and similar state laws, responsibility for the entire cost of cleaning up a contaminated site, as well as natural resource damages, can be imposed upon current or former site owners or operators and any party who releases or threatens to release one or more designated “hazardous substances” at the site, regardless of whether the original activities that led to the contamination were lawful at the time of disposal. This is known as strict liability, meaning liability without fault. CERCLA also authorizes EPA and, in some cases, third parties, to take actions in response to releases of hazardous substances into the environment and to seek to recover from the potentially responsible parties the costs of such response actions. Although CERCLA generally excludes petroleum from the definition of hazardous substances, in the course of our operations we may have generated and may generate other wastes that fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. We also may be an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been released by previous owners or operators. We may be subject to joint and several liability as well as strict liability under CERCLA for all or part of the costs of cleaning up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages. Joint and several liability is liability that may be apportioned either among two or more parties or to only one or a few select members of a group, making each party individually responsible for the entire obligation. In some situations we could be exposed to liability for clean-up costs and other damages as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of third parties at, or prior operators of, properties we have acquired. This includes, in some circumstances, operators of properties in which we have an interest and parties that provide transportation services for us. If exposed to joint and several liability, we could be responsible for more than our share of costs for remediating a particular site, and potentially for the entire obligation, even where other parties were involved in the activity giving rise to the liability. We have not, to our knowledge, been identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA, nor are we aware of any prior owners or operators of our properties that have been so identified with respect to their ownership or operation of those properties.
BLM Venting and Flaring Proposed Rule. On January 22, 2016 the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) released a proposed BLM Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation proposed rule. Comment on the proposed rule closed on April 22, 2016, and BLM issued its final rule on November 18, 2016. Petitions for judicial review of the rule were filed by industry groups and, as a result, BLM postponed compliance dates for certain sections of the rule pending judicial review. The rule is designed to replace the BLM's notice to lessees, NTL-4A, on venting and flaring at oil and gas facilities producing on federal and tribal lands. It deals with provisions related to venting and flaring of oil and natural gas, leak detection, storage tanks, pneumatic controllers and pumps, well maintenance and unloading, drilling and completions, and royalties. We are evaluating the economic implications of complying with this rule, but the rule could potentially lead to plugging and abandoning some of our existing oil and gas locations on federal and tribal lands.
Potentially Material Costs Associated with Environmental Regulation of Our Oil and Natural Gas Operations
 
Significant potential costs relating to environmental and land-use regulations associated with our existing properties and operations include those relating to: (i) plugging and abandonment of facilities; (ii) clean-up costs and damages due to spills or other releases; and (iii) penalties imposed for spills, releases or non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we typically have contractually assumed, and may assume in the future, obligations relating to plugging and abandonment, clean-up and other environmental costs in connection with our acquisition of operating interests in fields, and these costs can be significant.

Plugging and Abandonment Costs
 
Our operations are subject to stringent abandonment and closure requirements imposed by the various regulatory bodies including the BLM and state agencies.
 
As described in Note 5 to our financial statements, we have estimated the present value of our aggregate asset retirement obligations to be $3.5 million as of June 30, 2017. This figure reflects the expected future costs associated with site reclamation, facilities dismantlement and plugging and abandonment of wells. The discount rates used to calculate the present value varied depending on the estimated timing of the obligation, but typically ranged between 4% and 13 %. Actual costs may differ from our estimates. Our financial statements do not reflect any liabilities relating to other environmental obligations.
Competition
 
The oil and natural gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of additional reserves and in the sale of oil and natural gas. Our competitors consist of major and intermediate sized integrated oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators. The principal competitive factors in the acquisition of undeveloped oil and gas leases include the availability and quality of staff and data necessary to identify, investigate and purchase such leases, and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such leases. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, and more fully developed staffs and facilities than ours. In addition, the producing, processing and marketing of natural gas and crude oil are affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, the effect of which cannot be accurately predicted. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Ultimately, our future success will depend on our ability to develop or acquire additional reserves at costs that allow us to remain competitive.
Employees
 
At September 9, 2017, we had 12 employees, including 2 part time employees. The 2 part time employees are located in Perth, Western Australia and are involved in facilitating the administration of the Company.  9 employees are located in Denver, Colorado and 1 is located in North Dakota and works specifically on our Foreman Butte project in North Dakota and Montana.
