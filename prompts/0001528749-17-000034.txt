ITEM 1. BUSINESS
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
San Lotus Holding Inc was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 21, 2011. We changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of California (the "Conversion") on July 21, 2015. There are two main segments to our business - (1) travel services and (2) development of destination real estate.
 
Travel Services - this part of our business aims to market travel products to the growing "retired baby boomer" market, which an initial focus on the Asian market, via developing and operating a global travel and leisure agency business. We also had plans to develop joint ventures with partners in Asia to develop further potential travel related services to the market. 
 
The significant transaction to enter the travel business ultimately occurred on August 14, 2015, when we purchased XO Experience Inc. ("XO"), a company based in Rosemead, California. We purchased XO for $1 and a cash infusion of $150,000 into the business. XO was incorporated at the end of fiscal year 2013, although it had carried nominal business until the time of the purchase. This was a related party transaction because the owner of the travel business was also the Chairman of our Company at the time. He has resigned in January 2016. Our then chairman owned several other travel businesses at the time and the purpose of this transaction was to enable our Company to enter the travel market. In conjunction with the acquisition of XO, we had a series of various letter of intent with other travel agencies in both Canada and the US to acquire their locations through our then Chairman's connections, including those travel agencies owned by him. We also explored setting up travel agencies in Taiwan and purchasing travel agencies in other countries in our quest to enter the international travel business. These ultimately did not complete once our former chairman resigned in January 2016, and accordingly, our sole entrance into the market included only the purchase of XO.
 
XO provided two types of services - (1) Customers would purchase tour packages to their travel destinations through XO, including accommodation, ground transportation and arranged tours, etc. We would then purchase the actual tours from local tour operators who provide the services and we would mark up our services accordingly. Effectively, we act as agents to our customer. (2) We retail travel products, such as plane tickets, and earn commission from our suppliers. After the departure of our former Chairman in January 2016, we continued to operate XO, although experiencing challenges in operating the business without our former Chairman, who was also the previous owner of XO. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we ultimately decided to dissolve XO and are in the process of dissolving the company. We have therefore considered XO to be a discontinued operation.
 
XO was a brick and mortar location in 9368 Valley Boulevard, Suite 2, Rosemead California. Up until our exit of that business, that location also served as our principal executive office. Since the end of 2016, the location of the principle office has been moved, by virtue of our executive team, to Taiwan under the address of 3F B302C, No. 185 Kewang Road, Longtan District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.
 
We have currently exited the travel business and are focusing on our current assets, being the rights to land proceeds as described below. 
 
Development of Destination Real Estate - Prior to the acquisition of XO, we also acquired several parcels of land as described in Item 2 Properties. We have not developed these properties, nor have we entered into any contracts with developers. Until we have adequate cash for development work or obtain additional financing, we will hold the land until such time. 
 
Although there have been a number of attempts to acquire more land in the past, our landmark event occurred on March 31, 2015 when we purchased Mao Ren International Inc. ("Mao Ren"), a company incorporated under the laws of Taiwan (R.O.C.). Mao Ren was set up as an entity, by and on behalf of creditors, to recover the remaining assets to a Taiwanese company out of Taiwan. The Taiwanese company relates to funds raised by a Taiwanese company, approximately $300 million (including all interest and penalties), to invest in real estate deals in Taiwan. This scheme promised above-market monthly returns to close to 3,000 investors and after several years of rapid expansion, it became evident that the scheme was unsustainable and resulted in its eventual collapse. After the collapse, these investors/creditors neither had the power nor the resources to recover their share of the money owed. After several attempts, Mao Ren was ultimately incorporated as a brand new entity to seek the liquidation to the properties of debtor for and on behalf of the investors/creditors. Accordingly, Mao Ren owned the liquidation rights to the properties of debtor. While owning the liquidation rights to the properties of debtor, Mao Ren was obligated to pay the creditors NTD$913,401,823. After our acquisition of Mao Ren, we assumed the obligation paying the creditors the NTD$913,401,823 on June 12, 2015. The obligation was settled by issuing to them and their designees 29,464,575 shares of our common stock on June 12, 2015. While the obligation was settled by the issuance of shares, we retain the liquidation rights aforementioned. Mao Ren had initially assessed the value of the liquidation rights as NTD$913,401,823 prior to acquisition. But, we have reassessed the value of the liquidation rights as NTD$568,111,416 which incorporated the cash proceeds received from the land sales that occurred in 2016. 
 
Courts in Taiwan have recognized our liquidation rights to the properties of debtor, and therefore administer the actual liquidation of the lands of the debtor with Mao Ren that has the priority to receive the proceeds from such liquidation. During 2016, the courts liquidated a large plot of land and realized proceeds of NTD$304,792,503. The courts did not set aside any amount for the creditors that cannot be reached and have not come forward to place the claim during the process, and therefore we believe Mao Ren does not have a resulting financial liability to such creditor as of the date of this report. 
 
Currently, the courts are in the process of liquidating the remaining land parcels and we expect to realize cash from those sales during fiscal year 2017 and going forward. Once we realize the cash, our plans are to look at other plots of land in Asia, with a focus on the real property in Japan.
 
We have begun to acquire the ancillary assets and know-how to augment the two main segments to our main businesses. These ancillary assets and know-how include as follows: (1) intellectual property rights on media assets and media production capabilities and (2) proprietary research knowledge on tourism development in Japan and holding structure for future overseas development. These intellectual property rights on media assets and media production capabilities were acquired as a result of the significant transaction to purchase AHI Film Inc. and AHI Records Inc. on August 31, 2016.These transactions subsequently were closed on January 1, 2017. The said media assets, which are held under these two companies and their subsidiaries, include, but are not limited to, a feature motion picture; professional-grade photographs; professional-grade video footages; two completed music albums; and one semi-completed music album as well as other miscellaneous items. Through these acquisitions, key personnel have been retained to ensure that crucial functions to media production are kept in house for future development. We have concluded that these transactions were asset acquisitions. Separately, due to significant projected capital investments into Japan, the substantial efforts, in both time and resources, are devoted to develop and acquire the knowledge on the Japanese economy as a whole. Through the significant transaction on August 31, 2016 and subsequently closed on January 1, 2017 to purchase San Lotus Holding Inc. registered in British Virgin Islands (the “San Lotus Holding Inc. (BVI)”), we have acquired proprietary research knowledge on tourism development in Japan. The said proprietary knowledge includes, but is not limited to, historical research; economic statistics report; geographic analysis; real estate investment analysis; and most notably tourism specific research with particular focus on destination real estate development. Additionally, San Lotus Holding Inc. (BVI) will be used as a holding structure for future overseas development.
