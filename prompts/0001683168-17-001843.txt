Item 1. Business.
 
Our Background. Alamo Energy Corp. (“Alamo,” “We” or the “Company”), formerly Green Irons Holdings Corp., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 29, 2006 as to conduct a business in the golfing industry. On November 18, 2009, we entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement (“Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Alamo Oil Limited (“Alamo Oil”), pursuant to which we acquired certain oil and gas assets from Alamo Oil (“Asset Purchase”). Following the closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement and pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger”), effective as of November 19, 2009, we merged our newly formed and wholly-owned subsidiary into us, pursuant to which we changed our name to Alamo Energy Corp.
 
As a result of the Asset Purchase, we changed management, entered the oil and gas business, and ceased all activity in our former business. We are focused on exploration, acquisition, development, production and sale of crude oil and natural gas primarily from exploration and production areas within North America and the United Kingdom. We are qualified to do business in the State of Texas as “Texas Alamo Energy Corp.” We have not undergone bankruptcy, receivership, or any similar proceeding.
 
Our Business. We are an oil and gas company led by an experienced management team and focused on exploration, production and development of oil and natural gas within North America. Our business plan is to acquire oil and gas properties for exploration, appraisal and development with the intent to bring the projects to feasibility at which time we will either contract out the operations or joint venture the project with qualified interested parties. Our main priority will be given to projects with near term cash flow potential, although consideration will be given to projects that may not be as advanced from a technical standpoint but demonstrate the potential for significant upside.
 
In the United States, we have focused on the Appalachian Basin and currently own working interests in properties in West Virginia where we are not the operator. We currently have proved reserves in West Virginia.
 
The following is a description of our oil and gas interests and operations in West Virginia:
 
Valentine Agreement. In May 2010, we entered into a participation agreement with Allied Energy, Inc. (“Allied”), pursuant to which we acquired an undivided 50% working interest in the Florence Valentine Lease and a working interest and net revenue interest in the Valentine #1 re-entry well. This well is located on approximately 115 acres in Ritchie County, West Virginia within the Burning Springs Anticline. Allied is the operator of the project with full control of all operations. We paid the total drilling and completion costs of $153,500 to earn in the Valentine #1 re-entry well and the Florence Valentine lease before a payout working interest of 70% and net revenue interest of 59.08 (70% x 84.4%) and an after payout working interest of 50% and net revenue interest of 42.2% (50% x 84.4). Work on the Valentine #1 re-entry well commenced in June 2010 and is currently producing as of date of this Report.

Business Strategy. Our strategy is to increase shareholder value through strategic acquisitions, appraisal drilling and development. We are focused on the acquisition, appraisal development and exploitation of oil and gas properties.  We are also searching for possible joint-ventures and new prospects that fit our strategic focus. In the US, we have focused on the Appalachian Basin.  In the UK, we have focused on the Weald Basin in the South of England.
 
Competition. We compete with other companies for financing and for the acquisition of new oil and gas properties. Many of the oil and gas exploration companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of oil and gas properties of merit, on exploration of their properties and on development of their properties. In addition, they may be able to afford more geological and other technical expertise in the targeting and exploration of oil and gas properties. This competition could result in competitors having properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve the financing necessary for us to conduct further exploration of our acquired properties.
 
We will also compete with other junior oil and gas exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in junior oil and gas exploration companies. The presence of competing junior oil and gas exploration companies may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our exploration programs if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on the merit of the oil and gas properties under investigation and the price of the investment offered to investors.
 
We also compete with other junior and senior oil and gas companies for available resources, including, but not limited to, professional exploration and production, geological and engineering personnel services and supplies, for the drilling completion and production of hydrocarbon resources.
 
Intellectual Property. We do not presently own any copyrights, patents or trademarks. We own the Internet domain name www.alamoenergycorp.com. Under current domain name registration practices, no one else can obtain an identical domain name, but someone might obtain a similar name, or the identical name with a different suffix, such as “.org”, or with a country designation. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in foreign countries is subject to change, and we could be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our domain names.
 
Governmental Regulation. Our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations.  Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling and abandonment bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas. The production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of oil and gas, by-products thereof, and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations are also subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating primarily to the protection of human health and the environment. To date, we have incurred no cost related to complying with these laws, for remediation of existing environmental contamination and for plugging and reclamation of our oil and gas exploration property. The requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations.
 
Employees. As of April 30, 2017, we have three employees. We plan to outsource independent consultant engineers and geologists on a part time basis to conduct the work programs on our properties in order to carry out our plan of operations.
 
Facilities. Our executive offices are located at 3000 Wilcrest Dr, Suite 220, Houston, Texas 77042, where we occupy approximately 690 square feet of office space. We sublease our offices from Allan Millmaker, our officer and director, in exchange for $1,000 per month on a month to month basis.
 
Internet Website. Our Internet website, which is located at www.alamoenergycorp.com, describes each of our oil and gas projects, our management and provides additional information regarding our industry.
