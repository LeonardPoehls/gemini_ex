General
 
Bank Mutual Corporation (the “Company”) is a Wisconsin corporation headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Company owns 100% of the common stock of Bank Mutual (the “Bank”) and currently engages in no substantial activities other than its ownership of such stock. Consequently, the Company’s net income and cash flows are derived primarily from the Bank’s operations and capital distributions. The Company is regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”). The Company’s common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol BKMU.
 
The Bank was founded in 1892 and is a federally-chartered savings bank headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and its deposits are insured within limits established by the FDIC. The Bank's primary business is community banking, which includes attracting deposits from and making loans to the general public and private businesses, as well as governmental and non-profit entities. In addition to deposits, the Bank obtains funds through borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Chicago. These funding sources are principally used to originate loans, including commercial and industrial loans, multi-family residential loans, non-residential commercial real estate loans, one- to four-family loans, home equity loans, and other consumer loans. From time-to-time the Bank also purchases and/or participates in loans from third-party financial institutions and is an active seller of residential loans in the secondary market. It also invests in mortgage-related and other investment securities.

The Company’s principal executive office is located at 4949 West Brown Deer Road, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53223, and its telephone number at that location is (414) 354-1500. The Company’s website is www.bankmutualcorp.com. The Company will make available through that website, free of charge, its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practical after the Company files those reports with, or furnishes them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Also available on the Company’s website are various documents relating to the corporate governance of the Company, including its Code of Ethics and its Code of Conduct.
 
Market Area
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company had 64 banking offices in Wisconsin and one in Minnesota. The Company is the third largest financial institution headquartered in Wisconsin based on total assets and the fourth largest based on deposit market share. At June 30, 2016, the Company had a 1.30% market share of all deposits held by FDIC-insured institutions in Wisconsin.
 
The largest concentration of the Company’s offices is in southeastern Wisconsin, consisting of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”), and Racine and Kenosha Counties. The Company has 24 offices in these areas. The Company also has five offices in south central Wisconsin, consisting of the Madison MSA and the Janesville/Beloit MSA, as well as five other offices in communities in east central Wisconsin. The Company also operates 17 banking offices in northeastern Wisconsin, including the Green Bay MSA. Finally, the Company has 13 offices in northwestern Wisconsin, including the Eau Claire MSA, and one office in Woodbury, Minnesota, which is part of the Minneapolis-St. Paul MSA. A number of the Company’s banking offices are located near the Michigan and Illinois borders. Therefore, the Company may also draw customers from nearby regions in those states.
 
The services provided through the Company's banking offices are supplemented by services offered through ATMs located in the Company’s market areas, as well as internet and mobile banking, remote deposit capture, a customer service call center, and 24-hour telephone banking.
 
Competition
 
The Company faces significant competition in attracting deposits, making loans, and selling other financial products and services. Wisconsin has many banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, and tax-exempt credit unions, which offer the same types of banking products and services as the Company. The Company also faces competition from other types of financial service companies, such as mortgage brokerage firms, finance companies, insurance companies, investment brokerage firms, and mutual funds. As a result of advancements in information technology and increases in internet-based commerce in recent years, the Company also competes with financial service providers outside of Wisconsin, as well as non-bank financial technology firms that offer products and services that compete with those offered by the Company.
Lending Activities
 
General At December 31, 2016, the Company’s total loans receivable was $1.9 billion or 73.4% of total assets. The Company’s loan portfolio consists of loans to both commercial and retail borrowers. Loans to commercial borrowers include loans secured by real estate such as multi-family properties, non-residential commercial properties (referred to as “commercial real estate”), and construction and development projects secured by these same types of properties, as well as land. In addition, commercial loans include loans to businesses that are not secured by real estate (referred to as “commercial and industrial loans”). Loans to retail borrowers include loans to individuals that are secured by real estate such as one- to four-family first mortgages, home equity term loans, and home equity lines of credit. In addition, retail loans include student loans, automobile loans, and other loans not secured by real estate (collectively referred to as “other consumer loans”).
 
The nature, type, and terms of loans originated or purchased by the Company are subject to federal and state laws and regulations. The Company has no significant concentrations of loans to particular borrowers or to borrowers engaged in similar activities. In addition, the Company limits its lending activities primarily to borrowers and related loan collateral located in its primary market areas, which consist of Wisconsin and contiguous regions of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and northern Michigan. However, from time-to-time the Company will make loans secured by properties outside of its primary market areas provided the borrowers are located within such areas and are well-known to the Company. For specific information related to the Company’s loans receivable for the periods covered by this report, refer to “Financial Condition—Loans Receivable” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Commercial and Industrial Loans At December 31, 2016, the Company’s portfolio of commercial and industrial loans was $241.7 million or 11.0% of its gross loans receivable. This portfolio consists of loans and lines of credit to businesses for equipment purchases, working capital, debt refinancing or restructuring, business acquisition or expansion, Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans, and domestic standby letters of credit. The unfunded portion of approved commercial and industrial lines of credit and letters of credit was $185.5 million as of December 31, 2016. Typically, commercial and industrial loans are secured by general business security agreements and personal guarantees. The Company offers variable, adjustable, and fixed-rate commercial and industrial loans. The Company also has commercial and industrial loans that have an initial period where interest rates are fixed, generally for one to five years, and thereafter are adjustable based on various market indices. Fixed-rate loans are priced at either a margin over various market indices with maturities that correspond to the maturities of the notes or to match competitive conditions and yield requirements. Term loans are generally amortized over a three to seven year period. Commercial lines of credit generally have a term of one year and are subject to annual renewal thereafter. The Company performs an annual credit review of all commercial and industrial borrowers having an exposure to the Company of $500,000 or more.
Multi-family and Commercial Real Estate Loans At December 31, 2016, the Company’s aggregate portfolio of multi-family and commercial real estate loans was $881.6 million or 40.2% of its gross loans receivable. The Company’s multi-family and commercial real estate loan portfolios consist of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans originated at prevailing market rates usually tied to various market indices. This portfolio generally consists of loans secured by apartment buildings, office buildings, retail centers, warehouses, and industrial buildings. Loans in this portfolio may be secured by either owner or non-owner occupied properties. Loans in this portfolio typically do not exceed 80% of the lesser of the purchase price or an independent appraisal by an appraiser designated by the Company. Loans originated with balloon maturities are generally amortized on a 20 to 30 year basis with a typical balloon term of 3 to 10 years. If a multi-family or commercial real estate borrower desires a fixed-rate loan with a balloon maturity beyond five years, the Company generally requires the borrower to commit to an adjustable-rate loan that is converted back into a fixed-rate exposure through an interest rate swap agreement between the Company and the borrower. The Company then enters into an offsetting interest rate swap agreement with a third-party financial institution that converts the Company’s interest rate risk exposure back into a floating-rate exposure. The Company will generally record fee income related to the difference in the fair values of the respective interest rate swaps on the date of the transaction. Refer to “Financial Derivatives,” below, for additional discussion.
 
Loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate are granted based on the income producing potential of the property, the financial strength and/or income producing potential of the borrower, and the appraised value of the property. In most cases, the Company also obtains personal guarantees from the principals involved, the assessment of which is also based on financial strength and/or income producing potential. The Company’s approval process includes a review of the other debt obligations and overall sources of cash flow available to the borrower and guarantors. The property’s expected net operating income must be sufficient to cover the payments relating to the outstanding debt. The Company generally requires an assignment of rents or leases to be assured that the cash flow from the property will be used to repay the debt. Appraisals on properties securing multi-family and larger commercial real estate loans are performed by independent state certified or licensed appraisers approved by the board of directors. Title and hazard insurance are required as well as flood insurance, if applicable. Environmental assessments are performed on certain multi-family and commercial real estate loans in excess of $1.0 million, as well as all loans secured by certain properties that the Company considers to be “environmentally sensitive.” In addition, the Company performs an annual credit review of its multi-family and commercial real estate loans over $500,000.
 
Loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate properties are generally larger and involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Such loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. The Bank has internal lending limits to single borrowers or a group of related borrowers that are adjusted from time-to-time, but are generally well below the Bank’s legal lending limit of approximately $42.8 million as of December 31, 2016. Because payments on loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Furthermore, borrowers’ problems in areas unrelated to the properties that secure the Company’s loans may have an adverse impact on such borrowers’ ability to comply with the terms of the Company’s loans.

Construction and Development Loans At December 31, 2016, the Company’s portfolio of construction and development loans was $374.8 million or 17.1% of its gross loans receivable. This amount included the unfunded portion of approved construction and development loans of $200.8 million as of that same date. Construction and development loans typically have terms of 18 to 24 months, are interest-only, and carry variable interest rates tied to a market index. Disbursements on these loans are based on draw requests supported by appropriate lien waivers. Construction loans typically convert to permanent loans at the completion of a project, but may or may not remain in the Company’s loan portfolio depending on the competitive environment for permanent financing at the end of the construction term. Development loans are typically repaid as the underlying lots or housing units are sold. Construction and development loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than mortgage loans on completed properties. The Company's risk of loss on a construction and development loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's value at completion of construction, the estimated cost of construction, the appropriate application of loan proceeds to the work performed, the borrower's ability to advance additional construction funds if necessary, and the stabilization period for lease-up after the completion of construction. In addition, in the event a borrower defaults on the loan during its construction phase, the construction project often needs to be completed before the full value of the collateral can be realized by the Company. The Company performs an annual credit review of its construction and development loans over $500,000.
Residential Mortgage Loans At December 31, 2016, the Company’s portfolio of one- to four-family first mortgage loans was $500.0 million or 22.8% of its gross loans receivable. This amount included the unfunded portion of approved construction loans of $26.8 million as of that same date. Most of these loans are for owner-occupied residences; however, the Company also originates first mortgage loans secured by second homes, seasonal homes, and investment properties.
 
The Company originates primarily conventional fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and adjustable-rate residential mortgage (“ARM”) loans with maturity dates up to 30 years. Such loans generally are underwritten to the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and other regulatory standards. In general, ARM loans are retained by the Company in its loan portfolio. Conventional fixed-rate residential mortgage loans are generally sold in the secondary market without recourse, although the Company typically retains the servicing rights to such loans. When the Company sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, it makes representations and warranties to the purchasers about various characteristics of each loan, including the underwriting standards applied and the documentation being provided. Failure of the Company to comply with the requirements established by the purchaser of the loan may result in the Company being required to repurchase the loan. There have not been any material instances where the Company has been required to repurchase loans.
 
The Company also originates “jumbo” single family mortgage loans in excess of the Fannie Mae maximum loan amount, which was $417,000 for single family homes in its primary market areas. Fannie Mae has higher limits for two-, three- and four-family homes. The Company generally retains fixed-rate jumbo single family mortgage loans in its portfolio.
 
From time-to-time the Company also originates fixed-rate and ARM loans under special programs for low- to moderate-income households and first-time home buyers. These programs are offered to help meet the credit needs of the communities the Company serves and are retained by the Company in its loan portfolio. Among the features of these programs are lower down payments, no mortgage insurance, and generally less restrictive requirements for qualification compared to the Company’s conventional one- to four-family mortgage loans. These loans generally have maturities up to 30 years.
 
From time-to-time the Company also originates loans under programs administered by various government agencies such as the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (“WHEDA”). Loans originated under these programs may or may not be held by the Company in its loan portfolio and the Company may or may not retain the servicing rights for such loans.
 
ARM loans pose credit risks different from the risks inherent in fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying payments from the borrowers increase, which increases the potential for payment default. At the same time, the marketability and/or value of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. ARM loans generally have an initial fixed-rate term of five or seven years. Thereafter, they are adjusted on an annual basis up to a maximum of 200 basis points per year. The Company originates ARM loans with lifetime caps set at 6% above the origination rate. Monthly payments of principal and interest are adjusted when the interest rate adjusts. The Company does not offer ARM loans with negative amortization or with interest-only payment features. The Company currently utilizes the monthly average yield on United States treasury securities, adjusted to a constant maturity of one year (“constant maturity treasury index”) as the base index to determine the interest rate payable upon the adjustment date of ARM loans. The volume and types of ARM loans the Company originates have been affected by the level of market interest rates, competition, consumer preferences, and the availability of funds. ARM loans are susceptible to early prepayment during periods of lower interest rates as borrowers refinance into fixed-rate loans.

The Company requires an appraisal of the real estate that secures a residential mortgage loan, which must be performed by an independent state certified or licensed appraiser approved by the board of directors, but contracted and administered by an independent third party. A title insurance policy is required for all real estate first mortgage loans. Evidence of adequate hazard insurance and flood insurance, if applicable, is required prior to closing. Borrowers are required to make monthly payments to fund principal and interest as well as private mortgage insurance and flood insurance, if applicable. With some exceptions for lower loan-to-value ratio loans, borrowers are also generally required to escrow in advance for real estate taxes. Generally, no interest is paid on these escrow deposits. If borrowers with loans having a lower loan-to-value ratio want to handle their own taxes and insurance, an escrow waiver fee is charged. With respect to escrowed real estate taxes, the Company generally makes this disbursement directly to the borrower as obligations become due.
 
The Company’s staff underwriters review all pertinent information prior to making a credit decision on an application. All recommendations to deny are reviewed by a designated senior officer of the Company, in addition to staff underwriters, prior to the final disposition of the application. The Company’s lending policies generally limit the maximum loan-to-value ratio on single family mortgage loans secured by owner-occupied properties to 95% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property. This limit is lower for loans secured by two-, three-, and four-family homes. Loans above 80% loan-to-value ratios are subject to private mortgage insurance to reduce the Company’s exposure to less than 80% of value, except for certain low to moderate income loan program loans.
 
In addition to servicing the loans in its own portfolio, the Company continues to service most of the loans that it sells to Fannie Mae and other third-party investors (“loans serviced for third-party investors”). Servicing mortgage loans, whether for its own portfolio or for third-party investors, includes such functions as collecting monthly principal and interest payments from borrowers, maintaining escrow accounts for real estate taxes and insurance, and making certain payments on behalf of borrowers. When necessary, servicing of mortgage loans also includes functions related to the collection of delinquent principal and interest payments, loan foreclosure proceedings, and disposition of foreclosed real estate. As of December 31, 2016, loans serviced for third-party investors amounted to $997.0 million. These loans are not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
 
When the Company services loans for third-party investors, it is compensated through the retention of a servicing fee from borrowers' monthly payments. The Company pays the third-party investors an agreed-upon yield on the loans, which is generally less than the interest agreed to be paid by the borrowers. The difference, typically 25 basis points or more, is retained by the Company and recognized as servicing fee income over the lives of the loans, net of amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”). The Company also receives fees and interest income from ancillary sources such as delinquency charges and float on escrow and other funds.
 
Management believes that servicing mortgage loans for third-party investors partially mitigates other risks inherent in the Company's mortgage banking operations. For example, fluctuations in volumes of mortgage loan originations and resulting gains on sales of such loans caused by changes in market interest rates will generally be offset by opposite changes in the amortization of the MSRs. These fluctuations are usually the result of actual loan prepayment activity and/or changes in management expectations for future prepayment activity, which impacts the amount of MSRs amortized in a given period. However, fluctuations in the recorded value of MSRs may also be caused by valuation allowances required to be recognized under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). That is, the value of servicing rights may fluctuate because of changes in the future prepayment assumptions or discount rates used to periodically assess the impairment of MSRs. Although most of the Company's serviced loans that prepay are replaced by new serviced loans (thus preserving the future servicing cash flow), GAAP requires impairment losses resulting from a change in future prepayment assumptions to be recorded when the change occurs. MSRs are particularly susceptible to impairment losses during periods of declining interest rates during which prepayment activity typically accelerates to levels above that which had been anticipated when the servicing rights were originally recorded. Alternatively, in periods of increasing interest rates, during which prepayment activity typically declines, the Company could potentially recapture through earnings all or a portion of a previously established valuation allowance for impairment.

Home Equity Loans At December 31, 2016, the Company’s portfolio of home equity loans was $175.6 million or 8.0% of its gross loans receivable. Home equity loans include fixed term home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. The unfunded portion of approved home equity lines of credit was $111.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Home equity loans are typically secured by junior liens on owner-occupied one- to four-family residences, but in many instances are secured by first liens on such properties. Underwriting procedures for the home equity and home equity lines of credit loans include a comprehensive review of the loan application, an acceptable credit score, verification of the value of the equity in the home, and verification of the borrower’s income.
 
The Company originates fixed-rate home equity term loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 89.99% (when combined with any other mortgage on the property). Pricing on fixed-rate home equity term loans is periodically reviewed by management. Generally, loan terms are in the three to fifteen year range in order to minimize interest rate risk.
 
The Company also originates home equity lines of credit. Home equity lines of credit are variable-rate loans secured by first liens or junior liens on owner-occupied one- to four-family residences. Current interest rates on home equity lines of credit are tied to an index rate, adjust monthly after an initial interest rate lock period, and generally have floors that vary depending on the loan-to-value ratio. Home equity line of credit loans are made for terms up to 10 years and require minimum monthly payments.
 
Other Consumer Loans At December 31, 2016, the Company’s portfolio of other consumer loans was $18.2 million or 0.8% of its gross loans receivable. Other consumer loans include student loans, automobile loans, recreational vehicle and boat loans, deposit account loans, overdraft protection lines of credit, and unsecured consumer loans, including loans through credit card programs that are administered by third parties. The Company no longer originates student loans through programs guaranteed by the federal government. Student loans that continue to be held by the Company are administered by a third party. The unfunded portion of customers’ approved credit card lines was $49.9 million as of December 31, 2016.
 
Other consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher rates of interest than conventional mortgage loans, but typically involve more credit risk because of the nature of the collateral and, in some instances, the absence of collateral. In general, other consumer loans are more dependent upon the borrower's continuing financial stability, more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances, and often secured by rapidly depreciating personal property. In addition, various laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that may be recovered from a borrower. The Company believes that the higher yields earned on other consumer loans compensate for the increased risk associated with such loans and that consumer loans are important to the Company’s efforts to increase the interest rate sensitivity and shorten the average maturity of its loan portfolio.
 
Asset Quality
 
General The Company has policies and procedures in place to manage its exposure to credit risk related to its lending operations. As a matter of policy, the Company limits its lending to geographic areas in which it has substantial familiarity and/or a physical presence. Currently, this is limited to certain specific market areas in Wisconsin and contiguous states. In addition, from time-to-time the Company will prohibit or restrict lending in situations in which the underlying business operations and/or collateral exceed management’s tolerance for risk. The Company obtains appraisals of value prior to the origination of mortgage loans or other secured loans. It also manages its exposure to risk by regularly monitoring loan payment status, conducting periodic site visits and inspections, obtaining regular financial updates from large borrowers and/or guarantors, corresponding regularly with large borrowers and/or guarantors, and/or updating appraisals as appropriate, among other things. These procedures are emphasized when a borrower has failed to make scheduled loan payments, has otherwise defaulted on the terms of the loan agreement, or when management has become aware of a significant adverse change in the financial condition of the borrower, guarantor, or underlying collateral. For specific information relating to the Company’s asset quality for the periods covered by this report, refer to “Financial Condition—Asset Quality” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Internal Risk Ratings and Classified Assets OCC regulations require thrift institutions to review and, if necessary, classify their assets on a regular basis. Accordingly, the Company has internal policies and procedures in place to evaluate and/or maintain risk ratings on all of its loans and certain other assets. In general, these internal risk ratings correspond with regulatory requirements to adversely classify problem loans and certain other assets as “substandard,” “doubtful,” or “loss.” A loan or other asset is adversely classified as substandard if it is determined to involve a distinct possibility that the Company could sustain some loss if deficiencies associated with the loan are not corrected. A loan or other asset is adversely classified as doubtful if full collection is highly questionable or improbable. A loan or other asset is adversely classified as loss if it is considered uncollectible, even if a partial recovery could be expected in the future. The regulations also provide for a “special mention” designation, described as loans or assets which do not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant adverse classification, but which demonstrate clear trends in credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management's close attention (refer to the following paragraph for additional discussion). As of December 31, 2016, $54.4 million or 2.8% the Company’s loans were classified as special mention and $22.5 million or 1.2% were classified as substandard. The latter includes all loans placed on non-accrual in accordance with the Company’s policies, as described below. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, $11.6 million of the Company’s mortgage-related securities, consisting of private-label collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) rated less than investment grade, were classified as substandard in accordance with regulatory guidelines. The Company had no loans or other assets classified as doubtful or loss at December 31, 2016.
 
Loans that are not classified as special mention or adversely classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss are classified as “pass” or “watch” in accordance with the Company’s internal risk rating policy. Pass loans are generally current on contractual loan and principal payments, comply with other contractual loan terms, and have no noticeable credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses. Watch loans are also generally current on payments and in compliance with loan terms, but a particular borrower’s financial or operating conditions may exhibit early signs of credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. Such deficiencies and/or weaknesses typically include, but are not limited to, the borrower’s financial or operating condition, deterioration in liquidity, increased financial leverage, declines in the condition or value of related collateral, recent changes in management or business strategy, or recent developments in the economic, competitive, or market environment of the borrower. If adverse observations noted in these areas are not corrected, further downgrade of the loan may be warranted.
 
Delinquent Loans When a borrower fails to make required payments on a loan, the Company takes a number of steps to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status. In the case of one- to four-family mortgage loans, the Company’s loan servicing department is responsible for collection procedures from the 15th day of delinquency through the completion of foreclosure. Specific procedures include late charge notices, telephone contacts, and letters. If these efforts are unsuccessful, foreclosure notices will eventually be sent. The Company may also send either a qualified third party inspector or a loan officer to the property in an effort to contact the borrower. When contact is made with the borrower, the Company attempts to obtain full payment or work out a repayment schedule to avoid foreclosure of the collateral. Many borrowers pay before the agreed upon payment deadline and it is not necessary to start a foreclosure action. The Company follows collection procedures and guidelines outlined by Fannie Mae, WHEDA, and, when applicable, other government-sponsored loan programs.
 
The collection procedures for retail loans, excluding student loans and credit card loans, include sending periodic late notices to a borrower and attempts to make direct contact with a borrower once a loan becomes 30 days past due. If collection activity is unsuccessful, the Company may pursue legal remedies itself, refer the matter to legal counsel for further collection efforts, seek foreclosure or repossession of the collateral (if any), and/or charge-off the loan. All student loans are serviced by a third party that guarantees that its servicing complies with all U.S. Department of Education guidelines. The Company’s student loan portfolio is guaranteed under programs sponsored by the U.S. government. Credit card loans are serviced by a third party administrator.
 
The collection procedures for commercial loans include sending periodic late notices to a borrower once a loan is past due. The Company attempts to make direct contact with a borrower once a loan becomes 15 days past due. The Company’s managers of the multi-family and commercial real estate loan areas regularly review loans that are 10 days or more delinquent. If collection activity is unsuccessful, the Company may refer the matter to legal counsel for further collection effort. After 90 days, loans that are delinquent are typically proposed for repossession or foreclosure.
 
In working with delinquent borrowers, if the Company cannot develop a repayment plan that substantially complies with the original terms of the loan agreement, the Company’s practice has been to pursue foreclosure or repossession of the underlying collateral. As a matter of practice, the Company has not restructured or modified troubled loans in a manner that has resulted in material amounts of loss under accounting rules. In most cases the Company continues to report restructured or modified troubled loans as non-performing loans unless the borrower has clearly demonstrated the ability to service the loan in accordance with the new terms.

The Company’s policies require that management continuously monitor the status of the loan portfolio and report to the board of directors on a monthly basis. These reports include information on classified loans, delinquent loans, restructured or modified loans, allowance for loan losses, and foreclosed real estate.
 
Non-Accrual Policy With the exception of student loans that are guaranteed by the U.S. government, the Company generally stops accruing interest income on loans when interest or principal payments are 90 days or more in arrears or earlier when the future collectability of such interest or principal payments may no longer be certain. In such cases, borrowers have often been able to maintain a current payment status, but are experiencing financial difficulties and/or the properties that secure the loans are experiencing increased vacancies, declining lease rates, and/or delays in unit sales. In such instances, the Company generally stops accruing interest income on the loans even though the borrowers are current with respect to all contractual payments. Although the Company generally no longer accrues interest on these loans, the Company may continue to record periodic interest payments received on such loans as interest income provided the borrowers remain current on the loans and provided, in the judgment of management, the Company’s net recorded investment in the loans are deemed to be collectible. The Company designates loans on which it stops accruing interest income as non-accrual loans and establishes a reserve for outstanding interest that was previously credited to income. All loans on non-accrual are considered to be impaired. The Company returns a non-accrual loan to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful or uncertain collection no longer exist. In general, non-accrual loans are also classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss in accordance with the Company’s internal risk rating policy. As of December 31, 2016, $8.2 million or 0.42% of the Company’s loans were considered to be non-performing in accordance with the Company’s policies.
 
Foreclosed Properties and Repossessed Assets As of December 31, 2016, $2.9 million or 0.1% of the Company’s total assets consisted of foreclosed properties and repossessed assets. In the case of loans secured by real estate, foreclosure action generally starts when the loan is between the 90th and 120th day of delinquency following review by a senior officer and the executive loan committee of the board of directors. If, based on this review, the Company determines that repayment of a loan is solely dependent on the liquidation of the collateral, the Company will typically seek the shortest redemption period possible, thus waiving its right to collect any deficiency from the borrower. Depending on whether the Company has waived this right and a variety of other factors outside the Company’s control (including the legal actions of borrowers to protect their interests), an extended period of time could transpire between the commencement of a foreclosure action by the Company and its ultimate receipt of title to the property.
 
When the Company ultimately obtains title to the property through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, it transfers the property to “foreclosed properties and repossessed assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. In cases in which a non-consumer borrower has surrendered control of the property to the Company or has otherwise abandoned the property, the Company may transfer the property to foreclosed properties as an “in substance foreclosure” prior to actual receipt of title. Foreclosed properties and repossessed assets are adversely classified in accordance with the Company’s internal risk rating policy.
 
Foreclosed real estate properties are initially recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or fair value. Thereafter, the Company carries foreclosed real estate at fair value less estimated selling costs (typically 5% to 10%). Foreclosed real estate is inspected periodically to evaluate its condition. Additional outside appraisals are obtained as deemed necessary or appropriate. Additional write-downs may occur if the property value deteriorates further after it is acquired. These additional write-downs are charged to the Company’s results of operations as they occur.
 
In the case of loans secured by assets other than real estate, action to repossess the underlying collateral generally starts when the loan is between the 90th and 120th day of delinquency. The accounting for repossessed assets is similar to that described for real estate, above.
 
Loan Charge-Offs The Company typically records loan charge-offs when foreclosure or repossession becomes likely or legal proceedings related to such have commenced, the secondary source of repayment (consisting of a guarantor or operating entity) files for bankruptcy, or the loan is otherwise deemed uncollectible. The amount of the charge-off will depend on the fair value of the underlying collateral, if any, and may be zero if the fair market value exceeds the loan amount. All charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to allowance for loan losses. All charge-off activity is reviewed by the board of directors.

Allowance for Loan Losses As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s allowance for loan losses was $19.9 million or 1.03% of loans receivable and 242.5% of non-performing loans. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is based on factors such as the size and current risk characteristics of the portfolio, an assessment of individual problem loans and pools of homogenous loans within the portfolio, and actual loss, delinquency, and/or risk rating experience within the portfolio. The Company also considers current economic conditions and/or events in specific industries and geographical areas, including unemployment levels, trends in real estate values, peer comparisons, and other pertinent factors, including regulatory guidance. Finally, as appropriate, the Company also considers individual borrower circumstances and the condition and fair value of the loan collateral, if any. For additional information relating to the Company’s allowance for loan losses for the periods covered by this report, refer to “Results of Operations—Provision for Loan Losses” and “Financial Condition—Asset Quality” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires significant management judgment and estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on loans, the fair value of underlying collateral (if any), estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, changes in risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, and consideration of current economic trends, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Higher rates of loan defaults than anticipated would likely result in a need to increase provisions in future years. Also, increases in the Company’s multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and development, and commercial and industrial loan portfolios could result in a higher allowance for loan losses as these loans typically carry a higher risk of loss. Finally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the Company’s loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios and the related allowance for loan losses and valuations of foreclosed real estate. One or more of these agencies, particularly the OCC, may require the Company to increase the allowance for loan losses or reduce the recorded value of foreclosed real estate based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s results of operations. As a result of applying management judgment, it is possible that there may be periods when the amount of the allowance and/or its percentage to total loans or non-performing loans may decrease even though non-performing loans may increase.
 
Periodic adjustments to the allowance for loan loss are recorded through provision for loan losses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Actual losses on loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses. In the case of loans secured by real estate, charge-off typically occurs when foreclosure or repossession is likely or legal proceedings related to such have commenced, when the secondary source of repayment (consisting of a guarantor or operating entity) files for bankruptcy, or when the loan is otherwise deemed uncollectible in the judgment of management. Loans not secured by real estate, as well as unsecured loans, are charged off when the loan is determined to be uncollectible in the judgment of management. Recoveries of loan amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance as received. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis. The board of directors reviews management’s judgments related to the allowance for loan loss on at least a quarterly basis.
 
The Company maintains general allowances for loan loss against certain homogenous pools of loans. These pools generally consist of smaller loans of all types that do not warrant individual review due to their size. In addition, pools may also consist of larger commercial loans that have not been individually identified as impaired by management. Certain of these pools are further segmented by management’s internal risk rating of the loans. Management has developed loss factors for each pool or segment based on the historical loss experience of each pool or segment and internal risk ratings. In addition, management has developed loss factors for each pool or segment that are intended to capture management’s judgments relating to changes in economic and business conditions, underlying collateral values, underwriting and credit management policies and procedures, experience and ability of lending managers, legal and regulatory requirements, etc. Given the significant amount of management judgment involved in this process there could be significant variation in the Company’s allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses from period to period.

The Company maintains specific allowances for loan loss against individual loans that have been identified by management as impaired. These loans are generally larger loans, but management may also establish specific allowances against smaller loans from time-to-time. The allowance for loan loss established against these loans is based on one of two methods: (1) the present value of the future cash flows expected to be received from the borrower, discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or (2) the fair value of the loan collateral, if the loan is considered to be collateral dependent. In the Company’s experience, loss allowances using the first method have been rare. In working with problem borrowers, if the Company cannot develop a repayment plan that substantially complies with the original terms of the loan agreement, the Company’s practice has been to pursue foreclosure or repossession of the underlying collateral. As a matter of practice, the Company does not restructure troubled loans in a manner that results in a loss under the first method. As a result, most loss allowances are established using the second method because the related loans have been deemed collateral dependent by management.
 
Management considers loans to be collateral dependent when, in its judgment, there is no source of repayment for the loan other than the ultimate sale or disposition of the underlying collateral and foreclosure is probable. Factors management considers in making this determination typically include, but are not limited to, the length of time a borrower has been delinquent with respect to loan payments, the nature and extent of the financial or operating difficulties experienced by the borrower, the performance of the underlying collateral, the availability of other sources of cash flow or net worth of the borrower and/or guarantor, and the borrower’s immediate prospects to return the loan to performing status. In some instances, because of the facts and circumstances surrounding a particular loan relationship, there could be an extended period of time between management’s identification of a problem loan and a determination that it is probable that such loan is collateral dependent.
 
Management generally measures impairment of impaired loans whether or not foreclosure is probable based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. Such estimates are based on management’s judgment or, when considered appropriate, on an updated appraisal or similar evaluation. Updated appraisals are also typically obtained on impaired loans on at least an annual basis or when foreclosure or repossession of the underlying collateral is considered to be imminent. Prior to receipt of an updated appraisal, management has typically relied on the latest appraisal and knowledge of the condition of the collateral, as well as the current market for the collateral, to estimate the Company’s exposure to loss on impaired loans.
 
Investment Activities
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company’s portfolio of mortgage-related securities available-for-sale was $371.9 million or 14.0% of its total assets. As of the same date its portfolio of mortgage-related securities held-to-maturity was $93.2 million or 3.5% of total assets. Mortgage-related securities consist principally of mortgage-backed securities (“MBSs”) and CMOs. Most of the Company’s mortgage-related securities are directly or indirectly insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), or the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”). The remaining securities are private-label CMOs. Private-label CMOs generally carry higher credit risks and higher yields than mortgage-related securities insured or guaranteed by the aforementioned agencies of the U.S. Government. Although the latter securities have less exposure to credit risk, like private-label CMOs they remain exposed to fluctuating interest rates and instability in real estate markets, which may alter the prepayment rate of underlying mortgage loans and thereby affect the fair value of the securities. For additional information related to the Company’s mortgage-related securities, refer to “Financial Condition—Mortgage-Related Securities Available-for-Sale” and “Financial Condition—Mortgage-Related Securities Held-to-Maturity” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
In addition to the mortgage-related securities previously described, the Company’s investment policy authorizes investment in various other types of securities, including U.S. Treasury obligations, federal agency obligations, state and municipal obligations, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers’ acceptances, repurchase agreements, federal funds, commercial paper, mutual funds, and, subject to certain limits, corporate debt and equity securities.
 
The objectives of the Company’s investment policy are to meet the liquidity requirements of the Company and to generate a favorable return on investments without compromising management objectives related to interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, and investment portfolio concentrations. In addition, from time to time the Company will pledge eligible securities as collateral for certain deposit liabilities, FHLB of Chicago advances, financial derivatives, and other purposes permitted or required by law.
 
The Company’s investment policy requires that securities be classified as trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity at the date of purchase. The Company’s available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the change in fair value recorded as a component of shareholders’ equity rather than affecting results of operations. The Company’s held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. The Company has not engaged in trading activities.

The Company’s investment policy prohibits the purchase of non-investment grade securities, although the Company may continue to hold investments that are reduced to less than investment grade after their purchase. Securities rated less than investment grade are adversely classified as substandard in accordance with federal guidelines (refer to Asset Quality—Internal Ratings and Classified Assets,” above).
 
Financial Derivatives
 
The Company’s policies permit the use of financial derivatives such as financial futures, forward commitments, and interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2016, the Company was using forward commitments to manage interest rate risk related to its sale of residential loans in the secondary market and interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk related to certain fixed-rate commercial loans and forecasted transaction cash flows. For additional information, refer to “Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 13. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Derivative Financial Instruments” in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Deposit Liabilities
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company’s deposit liabilities were $1.9 billion or 70.4% of its total liabilities and equity. The Company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms for both retail and business customers. The Company currently offers regular savings accounts, interest-bearing demand accounts, non-interest-bearing demand accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. The Company also offers IRA time deposit accounts and health savings accounts. When the Company determines its deposit rates, it considers rates offered by local competitors, benchmark rates on U.S. Treasury securities, and rates on other sources of funds such as FHLB of Chicago advances. For additional information, refer to “Financial Condition—Deposit Liabilities” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, pricing of deposits, and competition. The Company’s deposits are primarily obtained from the market areas surrounding its bank offices. The Company relies primarily on competitive rates, quality service, and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits. The Company does not rely on a particular customer or related group of individuals, organizations, or institutions for its deposit funding. From time to time the Company has used third-party brokers and a nationally-recognized reciprocal deposit gathering network to obtain wholesale deposits. The Company had no such deposits as of December 31, 2016.
 
Borrowings
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company’s borrowed funds were $439.2 million or 16.6% of its total liabilities and equity. The Company borrows funds to finance its lending, investing, and operating activities. Substantially all of the Company’s borrowings have traditionally consisted of advances from the FHLB of Chicago on terms and conditions generally available to member institutions. The Company’s FHLB of Chicago borrowings typically carry fixed rates of interest, have stated maturities, and are generally subject to significant prepayment penalties if repaid prior to their stated maturity. The Company has pledged certain one- to four-family first and second mortgage loans, as well as certain multi-family mortgage loans, as blanket collateral for current and future advances. From time to time the Company may also pledge mortgage-related securities as collateral for advances.
 
For additional information regarding the Company’s outstanding advances from the FHLB of Chicago as of December 31, 2016, refer to “Financial Condition—Borrowings” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Shareholders’ Equity
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company’s shareholders’ equity was $286.6 million or 10.8% of its total liabilities and equity. The Company and the Bank are both required to maintain specified amounts of regulatory capital pursuant to regulations promulgated by their respective federal regulators. Management’s objective is to maintain the Company and the Bank’s regulatory capital in an amount sufficient to be classified in the highest regulatory category (i.e., as a “well capitalized” institution). At December 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank exceeded all regulatory minimum requirements, as well as the amount required to be classified as a “well capitalized” institution. For additional discussion relating to regulatory capital standards refer to “Regulation and Supervision of the Company —Regulatory Capital Requirements” and “Regulation and Supervision of the Bank—Regulatory Capital Requirements,” below. For additional information related to the Company’s equity and the Company and Bank’s regulatory capital, refer to “Financial Condition—Shareholders’ Equity” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as “Note 8. Shareholders’ Equity” in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The Company has paid quarterly cash dividends since its initial stock offering in 2000. The payment of dividends is discretionary with the Company’s board of directors and depends on the Company’s operating results, financial condition, compliance with regulatory capital requirements, and other considerations. In addition, the Company’s ability to pay dividends is highly dependent on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends to the Company. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue the payment of dividends or that the level of dividends will not be reduced in the future. For additional information, refer to “Regulation and Supervision of the Bank—Dividend and Other Capital Distribution Limitations,” below.
 
From time to time, the Company has repurchased shares of its common stock which has had the effect of reducing the Company’s capital. However, as with the payment of dividends above, the repurchase of common stock is discretionary with the Company’s board of directors and depends on a variety of factors, including market conditions for the Company’s stock, the financial condition of the Company and the Bank, compliance with regulatory capital requirements, and other considerations. The Company currently has an active stock repurchase program in effect. However, because of the aforementioned considerations there can be no assurances the Company will repurchase shares of its common stock under the current stock repurchase program. For additional discussion relating to the Company’s current stock repurchase program, refer to “Financial Condition—Shareholders’ Equity,” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis.”
 
Subsidiaries
 
BancMutual Financial and Insurance Services, Inc. (“BMFIS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank that does business as “Mutual Financial Group,” provides investment, wealth management, and insurance products and services to the Bank’s customers and the general public. These products and services include equity and debt securities, mutual fund investments, tax-deferred annuities, life, disability, and long-term care insurance, property and casualty insurance, financial advisory services, and other brokerage-related services. BMFIS also offers fee-based financial planning and third-party-administered trust services to customers. These products and services are provided through an operating agreement with a leading, third-party, registered broker-dealer.
 
MC Development LTD (“MC Development”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, is involved in land development and sales. It owns five parcels of developed land totaling 15 acres in Brown Deer, Wisconsin. It also owns 50% of Arrowood Development LLC, which was formed to develop approximately 300 acres for residential purposes in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. Neither MC Development nor Arrowood Development LLC is currently engaged in significant efforts to develop its respective parcels of land.
 
Finally, the Bank has four other wholly-owned subsidiaries that are inactive, but are reserved for possible future use in related or other areas.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company employed 548 full time and 74 part time associates. Management considers its relations with its associates to be good.
 
Regulation and Supervision
 
General
 
The Company is a Wisconsin corporation and a registered savings and loan holding company under federal law. The Company files reports with and is subject to regulation and examination by the FRB. The Bank is a federally-chartered savings bank and is subject to OCC requirements as well as those of the FDIC. Any change in these laws and regulations, whether by the FRB, the OCC, the FDIC, or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank, and the Company’s shareholders.

Certain current laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank, and other material consequences of recent legislation, are summarized below. These summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such laws, regulations, or administrative considerations.
 
Regulation and Supervision of the Bank
 
General As a federally-chartered, FDIC-insured savings bank, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the OCC, as well as the regulations of the FDIC. This federal regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a federal savings bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC and depositors rather than the shareholders of the Company. This regulatory structure gives authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies regarding the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves.
 
The OCC regularly examines the Bank and issues a report on its examination findings to the Bank’s board of directors. The Bank’s relationships with its depositors and borrowers are also regulated by federal law, especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of the Bank’s loan documents. The Bank must file reports with the OCC and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into transactions such as mergers or acquisitions.
 
Regulatory Capital Requirements The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital standards administered by the federal banking agencies and as defined in the applicable regulations. These regulatory capital standards, require financial institutions such as the Bank to meet the following minimum regulatory capital standards to be classified as “adequately capitalized” under the regulations: (i) common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital equal to at least 4.5% of total risk-weighted assets, (ii) Tier 1 capital equal to at least 4% of adjusted total assets (known as the “leverage ratio”), (iii) Tier 1 risk-based capital equal to at least 6% of total risk-weighted assets, and (iv) total risk-based capital equal to at least 8% of total risk-weighted assets. At December 31, 2016, the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios exceeded both the minimum requirements to be classified as “adequately capitalized,” as well as the higher requirements necessary to be classified as a “well capitalized” for regulatory capital purposes. For additional information related to the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios, refer to “Note 8. Shareholders’ Equity” in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
 
In addition to the requirements described in the previous paragraph, regulatory capital regulations also introduced an element known as the “capital conservation buffer.” In order to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization such as the Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of CET1 capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements specified in the previous paragraph. This additional requirement is 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, although it phases-in at a rate of 0.625% per year from 2016 to 2019. Therefore, management’s objective is to maintain all of the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios in amounts that exceed the minimums described in the preceding paragraph, plus the capital conservation buffer. As such, management does not believe the capital conservation buffer will have any impact on the Bank’s capital contributions or discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.
 
Dividend and Other Capital Distribution Limitations Federal regulations generally govern capital distributions by savings associations such as the Bank, which include cash dividends or other capital distributions. Currently, the Bank must file an application with the OCC for approval of a capital distribution because the total amount of its capital distributions for the most recent calendar year has exceeded the sum of its earnings for that period plus its earnings that have been retained in the preceding two years. In certain other circumstances, however, the Bank may only be required to give the OCC a minimum of 30 days’ notice before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution. The Bank is also required to notify the FRB of its intent to declare a dividend or approve a capital distribution.
 
The FRB or the OCC may disapprove or restrict dividends or other capital distributions if (i) the savings association would be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized following the distribution; (ii) the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or (iii) the capital distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory-imposed condition. The FRB and OCC have substantial discretion in making these decisions. Refer to “Regulation and Supervision of the Company—Dividend and Other Capital Distribution Limitations,” below, for the impact that regulatory restrictions on the Bank’s capital distributions could have on the Company.

Loan Concentration Guidelines As part of their ongoing supervisory monitoring processes, federal regulatory agencies have established certain criteria to identify financial institutions such as the Bank that are potentially exposed to significant multi-family, non-owner occupied commercial real estate, and construction loan concentration risks. An institution that has experienced rapid growth in these types of loans or has notable exposure to such loans may be identified for further supervisory analysis to assess the nature and risk posed by such concentrations. Specifically, the federal regulatory agencies use the following criteria to identify concentrations in these types of loans:
 

· | Total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land loans represent 100% or more of the institution's total risk-based capital; or 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Total multi-family, non-owner occupied commercial real estate, construction, land development, and other land loans, represent 300 percent or more of the institution's total risk-based capital, and the total outstanding balance of such loans has increased by 50% or more during the past three years. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of December 31, 2016, the Bank’s holdings of and growth in multi-family, non-owner occupied commercial real estate, construction, land development, and other land loans exceeded the guidelines noted in the second bullet, above. As such, regulators have subjected the Bank’s lending operations and risk management controls to increased scrutiny. In response, management has taken steps to implement certain enhancements in its lending operations and controls that it believes will be satisfactory to its regulator. However, there can be no assurances that these enhancements will be considered adequate by the Bank’s regulator, that additional enhancements will not be required by its regulator, and/or that the Bank’s ability to originate or retain these types of loans will not be restricted by its regulator in the future. Such action could have an adverse impact on the Bank’s ability to grow its loan portfolio and its future results of operations.
 
Qualified Thrift Lender Test Federal savings associations must meet a qualified thrift lender (“QTL”) test or they become subject to operating restrictions. The Bank met the QTL test as of December 31, 2016, and anticipates that it will maintain an appropriate level of mortgage-related investments (which must be at least 65% of portfolio assets as defined in the regulations) and will otherwise continue to meet the QTL test requirements.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Chicago. The FHLB of Chicago makes loans (“advances”) to its members and provides certain other financial services to its members pursuant to policies and procedures established by its board of directors. The FHLB of Chicago imposes limits on advances made to member institutions, including limitations relating to the amount and type of collateral and the amount of advances.
 
As a member of the FHLB of Chicago, the Bank must meet certain eligibility requirements and must purchase and maintain common stock in the FHLB of Chicago in an amount equal to the greater of (i) $10,000, (ii) 0.40% of its mortgage-related assets at the most recent calendar year end, or (iii) 4.5% of its outstanding advances from the FHLB of Chicago. The FHLB of Chicago may require less than 4.5% for amounts borrowed under certain advance programs offered to member institutions. At December 31, 2016, the Bank owned $20.3 million in FHLB of Chicago common stock, which was in compliance with the minimum common stock ownership guidelines established by the FHLB of Chicago.
 
Deposit Insurance The deposit accounts held by customers of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to maximum limits, as provided by law. Insurance on deposits may be terminated by the FDIC if it finds that the Bank has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the OCC. The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition, or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance.
 
The FDIC establishes deposit insurance premiums for individual banks or savings associations based upon the risks a particular institution poses to its deposit insurance fund. Under its assessment system for relatively smaller institutions such as the Bank, the FDIC assigns an institution to one of four categories based on the composite assessment of the institution by its primary regulator, which along with certain financial ratios, determines its initial base assessment rate. The initial base assessment rate may be adjusted higher or lower depending on the amount of unsecured debt held by an institution, which results in a total assessment rate for an institution. Depending on these factors an institution’s total assessment rate could range from 1.5 to 30 basis points. The assessment base used by the FDIC in determining deposit insurance premiums consists of an insured institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity and certain other adjustments.

In 2016 the FDIC issued a new rule that could result in the creation of insurance premium credits for insured institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank. Each insured institution’s credits would be determined by the FDIC at a future date in accordance with performance measures established for the insurance fund, as specified in the new rule. The credits could be used by insured institutions to offset future premium costs until the credits are exhausted. At this time, management is unable to determine the amount or timing of credits that might be awarded, if any.
 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has broad rule-making and enforcement authority related to a wide range of consumer protection laws. This authority extends to all banks and savings institutions, such as the Bank. Accordingly, the activities of the CFPB could have a significant impact on the financial condition and/or operations of the Company. Management does not believe the activities of the CFPB have had a significant impact on the Bank to date. Although CFPB regulations apply to the Bank, institutions with $10 billion or less in assets (such as the Bank) are examined for compliance with CFPB directives by their applicable bank regulators rather than the CFPB itself.
 
Transactions With Affiliates Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and FRB Regulation W govern transactions between an insured federal savings association, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates, such as the Company. An affiliate is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with it. Sections 23A and 23B limit the extent to which an institution or a subsidiary may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such savings association’s capital stock and surplus, and limit all such transactions with all affiliates to 20% of such stock and surplus. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees, derivatives transactions, securities borrowing, and lending transactions to the extent that they result in credit exposure to an affiliate. Further, most loans by a savings association to any of its affiliates must be secured by specified collateral amounts. All such transactions must be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and must be on terms that are at least as favorable to the savings association as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. At December 31, 2016, the Company and Bank did not have any covered transactions.
Acquisitions and Mergers Under the federal Bank Merger Act, any merger of the Bank with or into another institution would require the approval of the OCC, or the primary federal regulator of the resulting entity if it is not an OCC-regulated institution. Refer also to “Regulation and Supervision of the Company—Acquisition of Bank Mutual Corporation,” below.
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements Savings associations are subject to the prohibitions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1972 on certain tying arrangements. A savings association is prohibited, subject to exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor.
Uniform Real Estate Lending Standards The federal banking agencies adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens on interests in real estate or are made to finance the construction of a building or other improvements to real estate. All insured depository institutions must adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for such extensions of credit. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, and documentation, approval and reporting requirements.
 
These lending policies must reflect consideration of the Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies that have been adopted by the federal bank regulators. These guidelines, among other things, require a depository institution to establish internal loan-to-value limits for real estate loans that are not in excess of specified supervisory limits, which generally vary and provide for lower loan-to-value limits for types of collateral that are perceived as having more risk, are subject to fluctuations in valuation, or are difficult to dispose. Although there is no supervisory loan-to-value limit for owner-occupied one- to four-family and home equity loans, the guidelines provide that an institution should require credit enhancement in the form of mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral for any such loan with a loan-to-value ratio that equals or exceeds 90% at origination. The guidelines also clarify expectations for prudent appraisal and evaluation policies, procedures, and practices.

Community Reinvestment Act Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), any insured depository institution, including the Bank, must, consistent with its safe and sound operation, help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the OCC to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications for additional branches and acquisitions.
 
Among other things, the CRA regulations contain an evaluation system that rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs. In particular, the evaluation system focuses on three tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas, (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making community development investments, and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices. The CRA requires the OCC to provide a written evaluation of the Bank’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system and requires public disclosure of the CRA rating. The Bank received a “satisfactory” overall rating in its most recent CRA examination.
 
Safety and Soundness Standards Each federal banking agency, including the OCC, has guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, customer privacy, liquidity, earnings, and compensation and benefits. The guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines also prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice.
Loans to Insiders A savings association’s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of more than 10% of its stock (each, “an insider”) and certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider’s “related interest”) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation O thereunder. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks. All loans by a savings association to all insiders and related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the savings association’s unimpaired capital and surplus. With certain exceptions, the Bank’s loans to an executive officer (other than certain education loans and residential mortgage loans) may not exceed $100,000. Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest be approved in advance by a majority of the Bank’s board of directors, without the vote of any interested director, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and related interests, would exceed $500,000. Generally, such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than, those for comparable transactions with other persons and must not present more than a normal risk of collectability. There is an exception for extensions of credit pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a savings association that is widely available to employees that does not give preference to officers, directors, and other insiders. As of December 31, 2016, total loans to insiders were $768,000 (including $659,000 which relates to residential mortgages that have been sold in the secondary market).
 
Regulation and Supervision of the Company
 
General The Company is a registered savings and loan holding company under federal law and is subject to regulation, supervision, and enforcement actions by the FRB. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to the Bank and to monitor and regulate the Company’s capital and activities such as dividends and share repurchases that can affect capital. Under long-standing FRB policy, holding companies are expected to serve as a source of strength for their depository subsidiaries, and may be called upon to commit financial resources and support to those subsidiaries. The requirement that the Company act as a source of strength for the Bank, and the future capital requirements at the Company level (refer to “Regulatory Capital Requirements,” below), may affect the Company's ability to pay dividends or make other distributions.
 
The Company may engage in activities permissible for a savings and loan holding company, a bank holding company, or a financial holding company, which generally encompass a wider range of activities that are financial in nature. The Company may not engage in any activities beyond that scope without the approval of the FRB.
 
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company from acquiring control of another savings institution or holding company without prior regulatory approval. With some exceptions, it also prohibits the acquisition or retention of more than 5% of the equity securities of a company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature or acquiring an institution that is not federally-insured. In evaluating applications to acquire savings institutions, the regulator must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.

Regulatory Capital Requirements The Company is subject to various regulatory capital standards administered by the federal banking agencies and as defined in the applicable regulations. These capital requirements are substantially the same as those required for the Bank (refer to “Regulation and Supervision of the Bank—Regulatory Capital Requirements,” above). However, the requirements are separately applied to the Company on a consolidated basis. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s regulatory capital ratios exceeded both the minimum requirements to be classified as “adequately capitalized,” as well as higher requirements necessary to be classified as “well capitalized” for regulatory capital purposes. For additional information related to the Company’s regulatory capital ratios, refer to “Note 8. Shareholders’ Equity” in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
 
Dividend and Other Capital Distribution Limitations FRB regulations generally govern capital distributions by savings and loan holding companies such as the Company, which include cash dividends and stock repurchases. Currently, the Company is not required to give the FRB any notice or application before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a stock repurchase. In certain other circumstances, however, the Bank would be required to give the FRB a notice or an application that meets certain filing requirements before the board of directors declares a dividend or stock repurchase.
 
The FRB may disapprove or restrict dividends or stock repurchases if (i) the savings and loan holding company would be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized following the distribution; (ii) the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or (iii) the capital distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory-imposed condition. The FRB has substantial discretion in making these decisions.
 
The Company is highly dependent on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or otherwise distribute its capital to the Company. Neither the Company nor the Bank can provide any assurances that dividends will continue to be paid by the Bank to the Company or the amount of any such dividends. Furthermore, the Company cannot provide any assurances that dividends will continue to be paid to shareholders, the amount of any such dividends, or whether additional shares of common stock will be repurchased under its current stock repurchase plan. For additional discussion related to the Company’s dividends and common stock repurchases refer to “Financial Condition—Shareholders’ Equity” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.”
 
Acquisition of Bank Mutual Corporation No person may acquire control of the Company without first obtaining the approval of such acquisition by the appropriate federal regulator. Currently, any person, including a company, or group acting in concert, seeking to acquire 10% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company (or otherwise gain the ability to control the Company) must, depending on the circumstances, obtain the approval of, and/or file a notice with the FRB.
Federal and State Taxation
 
Federal Taxation The Company and its subsidiaries file a calendar year consolidated federal income tax return, reporting income and expenses using the accrual method of accounting. The federal income tax returns for the Company and its subsidiaries have been examined or closed without examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for tax years prior to 2013.
State Taxation The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to combined reporting in the state of Wisconsin. The state income tax returns for the Company and its subsidiaries have been examined and closed by the Wisconsin Department of Revenue for tax years prior to 2012.
