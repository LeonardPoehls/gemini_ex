We believe that our business has been driven by delivery of best-in-class content, the regular introduction of new content and delivery methods, as well as the expansion of our sales and content-delivery channels.

Value and Marketability Strengths
 
Operational
 
Name and Reputation: Over the past 18 years, we developed a strong reputation in the personal development industry and are well recognized for the quality of our programs and content delivery.

We engage in a multi-segment strategy in our marketplace and offer products ranging in price from $28 to $47,500.
Diversified Client Base: No client represents more than 1% of our sales. The diversified customer base reduces the likelihood that our business will be significantly impacted by the loss of a single account.
Proprietary Expertise: We carved out a niche in the marketplace by focusing on the needs of small to medium-sized businesses. Further, we have developed unique programs geared toward leadership development and enhancing speaking and writing capabilities for skilled professionals.
Growth Opportunities: We launched two evergreen programs in the fourth quarter of 2016. Preliminary sales of these programs and the existing online modules exceeded $450,000 in 2016. We are confident that we can grow this business further with by expanding our marketing campaign to our captured audience of social media followers and our client database.

External
 
Market for the Company’s Services: The self-help marketplace experience two major shifts over the past four years. The demand for online content has risen dramatically. Secondly, there has been dramatic shift in the key participants in our marketplace. Steven Covey, Zig Ziglar and Jim Rohn have all passed away. Robert Kyoski filed for bankruptcy and Peter Lowe’s Get Motivated seminars went out of business. Louise Hay is in her 80s and Jack Canfield and Less Brown appear to be cutting back on their road schedules. Toby Robbins continues to have a strong presence in the marketplace but the marketplace is looking for new and fresh motivational speakers to fill the void left by the aforementioned individuals. With Lisa Nichols’ universal appeal, global reach of 36 million and our extensive content library and online training platform, we are strategically positioned to capitalize on this opportunity and be the next large-scale player in this space.

Customer Markets
 
We focus on two markets, the small business segment (businesses with more than one employee/owner), and the entrepreneur segment, which includes home-based and one-person business operations. Although we can service larger organizations, the greatest benefit of our services is derived from businesses with under $10 million in annual sales. The majority of these companies are comprised of "technicians" who are gifted in the work of their business, but typically do not have the resources to have in-house staff dedicated to strategic planning, professional development and/or coaching. Management’s goal is to secure approximately two-thirds of all its business from the small business segment because these organizations generally have greater financial resources than the entrepreneur segment.
 
The small business and entrepreneur markets are ideal targets for several reasons. As a small or entrepreneurial business, resources are often limited to core business functions such as production, administration, finance and distribution. Professional development, training, coaching and planning frequently go unnoticed and are often forgotten. As economic pressures increase and competition intensifies, these companies look for effective ways to increase their performance. Furthermore, as a small or entrepreneurial business, the owner is typically an accountable technician which means he or she has everything on the line with regard to their business succeeding or not, and that their area of expertise is in the business they are "in." Frequently, a technician will be attracted to the "work" of the business and neglect the fundamental health of the business, which includes nurturing both themselves and the customer base.

We believe that one of our growth drivers for 2017 will be the full-scale launch of our e-learning platform, which we expect to capitalize on the dramatic surge in demand for e-learning. According to Statistics MRC report titled “Global E-Learning Market Outlook (2014-2022)” released in September 2015, the e-earning market was approximately $165.36 billion in 2014 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.08% to reach $243.8 billion by 2022. The reports cites the following key factors that are favoring the market’s growth: flexibility in learning, low cost, easy accessibility, increased effectiveness by animated learning, rise in number of internet users and an increasing access of broadband pooled with mobile phones with online capabilities. The United States leads in e-learning sales followed by Asia.
 
Competitive Landscape
 
The key element in purchase decisions made in the industry is trust in the reputation and reliability of the professional development firm. The professional development industry is fragmented and disorganized, with thousands of smaller consulting organizations and individual consultants for every one of the few dozen well-known companies.
 
Our competitors range from major international name-brand consultants to tens of thousands of individuals. One of our challenges is establishing ourselves as a complete professional development company, creating "other" experts the client trust outside of Lisa Nichols while creating trust and confidence at the same level on a consistent basis. When dealing with the small or entrepreneurial business market, cost or price is one of our greatest obstacles. We have therefore chosen to focus on building our brand as a reliable, cost effective and successful business relationship partner with our clientele.
 
One of our key competitive advantages is the relationship we build with clients. We offer clients a unique experience that is ongoing and reinforces development, versus a typical "one-time" seminar format. Our programs provide development and support for a year or more. Since each strategic workshop client immediately qualifies for one-on-one coaching, we’re able to manage and monitor the specific progress of each client throughout his or her development process.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Overview
 
We believe that our primary keys to success are: (i) market exposure – building reputation and mind share; (ii) market penetration – both breadth and depth; (iii) client acquisition; (iv) client retention; and (v) achieving or surpassing projections through strong performance and fiscal management.
 
We generate revenue through the sale of our products and services. We have found that clients that attend our workshops have in essence pre-qualified themselves as people who are interested in learning about business and are willing to invest time and money to do so. At our seminars, we typically sell additional programs, tools and support to participants. At our typical seminar, 35% of the participants will spend at least $3,500 for some sort of after training education or support.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
Our marketing strategy is simple and cost-effective: exposure through live business seminars, which are delivered all over North America. We participated in, or conducted, over 25 live events in 2016 and this number is expected to grow to 30 in 2017. We are currently partnering with some of the leading online marketing firms to design and implement a robust and effective online marketing strategy.
Business Development Activities
 
We focus on marketing directly to over 600,000 professionals included in our proprietary database of over 215,000 (includes past and current clients, as well as any participant who attended an MNMT seminar and completed an evaluation) and 500,000 professionals via our social media platforms. We send a weekly newsletter featuring new products and services, success stories, and information on upcoming events. We believe that this approach results in considerable and consistent exposure with minimal cost.

One of our goals in 2017 is to build and leverage our database and client base to grow revenues. We conduct direct mailing with key affiliate partners, using the following four proven methods:
 

• | Sample Previews: These are invitation-only workshops that we host for referral sources (i.e., accountants, attorneys, financial planners, insurance professionals) as well as owners of businesses in a target market. The previews will be the actual first year program offered to paying clients. The intent is to provide value and proof of the strategic workshop process so that clients will be comfortable making referrals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Free Talks/Networking: This is an excellent opportunity for new coaches and new trainers to get exposure. These talks are given to Chambers of Commerce, trade councils, professional organizations, etc. Based on our industry experience it is most beneficial to have at least two of these talks per month and attend two networking events per month.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Referrals: Referrals make up a large part of our business. They create an effective drip campaign and a concentrated effort will leverage this opportunity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Income Generators / Special Project Assistance: This includes writing private programs for specific businesses, designing custom programs, and retainer based coaching on an ongoing basis.
