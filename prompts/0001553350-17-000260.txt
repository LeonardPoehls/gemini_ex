 BUSINESS.

Background

United Cannabis Corporation ("we", "our", "us", "UCANN", or the Company) a Colorado corporation, was originally formed as a California corporation under the name MySkin, Inc. on November 15, 2007. MySkin was engaged in the business of providing management services to a medical spa in Los Angeles, California which provided various advanced skin care services until March 31, 2014, when this business was sold to the prior President of the Company.

In early 2014 we decided to exit the medical spa management business and change our focus to providing products, services and intellectual property to the cannabis industry.

On March 26, 2014, we entered into a License Agreement with Earnest Blackmon, Tony Verzura and Chad Ruby pursuant to which Messrs. Blackmon, Verzura and Ruby licensed certain intellectual property to us in exchange for 38,690,000 shares of our common stock.

In connection with this transaction:


· | Messrs. Blackmon, Verzura and Ruby licensed to us all of their knowledge and know-how relating to the design and buildout of cultivation facilities, growing/cultivation systems, seed-to-sale protocols and procedures, products, access to a genetic catalogue including over 150 different strains, an advanced (non-psychoactive) cannabinoid sequencing therapy program utilizing patent-pending Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals called the A.C.T. Now Program (ACT Now or ACT Now Program), security, regulatory compliance, and other methods and processes which relate to the cannabis industry.
· | The territory for this license is the entire world and the license runs in perpetuity. There are no royalty payments under the License Agreement. 
· | Mr. Blackmon was elected as our President, Mr. Ruby was elected as Chief Operating Officer and Mr. Verzura was elected as Vice President. 
· | A total of 41,690,000 previously outstanding shares of common stock were cancelled resulting in a total of 43,620,000 shares of common stock outstanding on March 26, 2014. 


Messrs. Blackmon, Verzura and Ruby were appointed to our board of directors effective April 7, 2014.

In May, 2014 we changed our corporate domicile from California to Colorado and changed our name to United Cannabis Corporation.

Business Overview

We own distinct intellectual property relating to the legalized growth, production, manufacture, marketing, management, utilization and distribution of medical marijuana and marijuana infused products. 

Our primary goal is to advance the use of phytocannabinoid therapeutics in medicine through research, product development and education. We are dedicated to improving the lives of patients. We provide the intellectual property, patent-pending technology, trusted brands, clinical data, technical training, sales tools and methodologies necessary to assist our clients businesses for success.  Our ACT Now Program utilizes our patent-pending Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals with a HIPPAA compliant electronic health record (EHR) software that enables physicians to create comprehensive sequencing charts specific to their patients medical aliments. The ACT Now EHR software allows for global monitoring, patient management, and effective cannabinoid therapy protocols.
Our Products

We are focused on creating unique therapeutics for a wide range of diseases that can be utilized by patients globally.

Our Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinal products are designed to help supplement deficiencies related in the endocannabinoid system including pain, neuropathy, arthritis, MS, IBS, autism, seizures, eczema, sleep, anxiety, head trauma, opioid dependency and clinical endocannabinoid deficiencies. The endocannabinoid system is a signaling system within the human body that utilizes hundreds of receptors to help maintain homeostasis between the central nervous system and the immune system. 

Our Prana Aromatherapy Transdermal Roll-on line uses a proprietary blend of essential oils infused with cannabinoids designed to provide targeted and large surface relief with combinations of aromatherapy. The transdermal is a part of the complete patent-pending Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals line, which is offered in 5 categories (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5), with three delivery methods (sublingual, capsules, topical). Dosages range from 1mg to 50mg, are available in both raw or activated formulations, and paired with specific cannabis derived terpene profiles. 

Our products are subject to all existing marijuana laws in the United States.

Our short term plan involves licensing the technology associated with our products to companies which are licensed to grow and sell medical marijuana in states where medical marijuana is legal. 

Our long term plan is to perform clinical trials on the most promising products in our product line that are currently being manufactured in California. We intend to perform our phase I clinical trials at the West Indies University in Jamaica. We will fund the initial clinical trials by licensing our Prana product line to manufacturers in all legal territories in the United States and with revenue received for providing technical, financial and licensing consulting services. After our phase 1 clinical trials are complete, we plan on partnering with companies that have expertise in global pharmaceutical distribution and research for phase II and III clinical trials in the United States. 

We work closely with many individuals and businesses in the medical marijuana industry. Following is a summary of some of the key relationships which have been formalized with an agreement.

WeedMD (Canada)

On May 28, 2014, we signed a binding letter agreement with WeedMD RX Inc. (WeedMD), a private Canadian corporation, regarding the establishment of a strategic partnership with respect to growing, producing and selling medical marijuana in Canada. WeedMD is a medical marijuana company which has secured pre-license approval from Health Canada to produce and distribute 2,500 kg of medical marijuana from its 25,000 square foot facility in Aylmer, Ontario. In the letter agreement, we granted to WeedMD a royalty free license to use all of our intellectual property including our knowledge and know-how relating to the design and buildout of cultivation facilities, our catalogue of different strains of marijuana, our ACT Now Program, our growing expertise and other methods and processes which relate to the medical cannabis industry. WeedMD plans to use our intellectual property and our consulting services in connection with their project in Aylmer and any other projects in Canada. WeedMD has received the security approval from Health Canada for the Aylmer project and it is moving toward obtaining a cultivation license.

In consideration for the license to use our intellectual property and our consulting services, WeedMD issued us 1,187,500 shares of its common stock which represents approximately 3.6% of their shares outstanding and WeedMD issued to us warrants to purchase 3 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of CAD $.50 per share, however, these warrants expired on December 9, 2014.

On July 7, 2014, we borrowed $175,000 from WeedMD. The loan was due and payable on demand. On March 31, 2016, an unrelated third party agreed to assume all of our obligations pursuant to the loan in consideration for the transfer by us of 1,100,000 shares of the common stock of WeedMD to the unrelated third party. WeedMD consented to the assumption of the loan and released us from any further liability with respect to the loan.

Harborside Health Center

Founded in 2006 by Steve DeAngelo, Harborside Health Center is one of the largest medical cannabis dispensaries in the United States. Harborside has over 200,000 registered patients, and was first in the nation to support education for seniors, veterans and families with severely ill children; first in the country to offer CBD-rich medicine; and the first to treat children with Dravet syndrome. Harborside continues to set an example of diversity and compliance, and is one of the prime advocates of diversity, sustainability and economic justice in the industry.

Harborside has a license to use our intellectual property, and products in California. In consideration for this license, Harborside pays us 25% of the wholesale price of all products sold using our Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinal line. 

Blue River Extracts

Blue River Extracts, headquartered in Colorado, provides a full spectrum of aromatherapy and essential oil profiles, which are derived naturally from specific plant based cultivars utilizing a proprietary chemical-free process.  Terpenes are produced by countless plant species, prevalent in fruits, vegetables, herbs, spices, and other botanicals. Terpenes are also common ingredients in the human diet and have generally been recognized as safe to consume by the US Food and Drug Administration.

On January 1, 2016, we granted a license to Blue River for the right to use our pending global utility patent for the use of terpenes as a diluent in aromatherapy, vaporization, essential oils, edibles, aerosols, and for product branding purposes. We are paid $5,000 each month for the license, plus $500 for each hour of consulting service we provide Blue River. The license expires on December 31, 2020. 

Cannibinoid Research & Development Company Limited (CRD)

In August 2014, we acquired 50% of the capital stock of CRD. In August, 2014, we agreed to fund the operations of CRD on terms mutually agreed upon by us and CRD. As of December 31, 2016, CRD did not have any operations or operating activities. As of the date of this prospectus, CRD had five employees and had applied to the Jamaican government for a license to conduct research on the benefits of cannabis which will be grown by CRD in Jamaica.
Cherubim Interests, Inc.

In October, 2016, we signed an agreement with Cherubim Interests, Inc. Pursuant to the agreement, Cherubim will design and sell mobile extraction laboratories for sale to the marijuana industry. We have the exclusive right to solicit orders for the mobile laboratories throughout the world. All orders we obtain will be subject to acceptance by Cherubim.

ACT Now Program

One of our primary goals is to advance the use of cannabinoids in medicine through research, product development and education. Our intellectual property includes our ACT Now Program which is a comprehensive full spectrum cannabinoid therapy guide that utilizes the entire cannabis plant by controlling specific cannabinoid ratios, accurate dosing and multiple non-invasive delivery methods. Our ACT Now Program offers a wide range of affordable patient driven programs with limitless combinations of cannabinoid-based products and nutritional recommendations to assist patients suffering from chronic pain, opiate dependency, inflammation, glaucoma, PTSD, neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, Crohns, IBS, seizures, epilepsy, paralysis, autoimmune, autism, tumors, HIV/AIDS and many types of cancer.

We own certain proprietary formulations, processes and other intellectual property which can be used to produce our Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals in connection with our ACT Now Program. These products, which are made with unique combinations of pharmaceutically active cannabinoids, provide a comprehensive solution designed to enable physicians and patients to design, implement and monitor effective therapy protocols.

Competition

Currently, we are primarily engaged in the business of providing consulting and advisory services and licensing our intellectual property to businesses or persons who are already in the marijuana business or who desire to enter the business. There are a large number of other public and private companies which compete with us in this area. These competitors include MedBox, Inc., Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc., Growlife, Inc., Terra Tech Corp., American Cannabis Company, Americann, Inc. and Monarch America, Inc. (formerly Cannabis Kinetics, Inc.). We believe that our principal competitive advantages are the reputations and experience of our principals in the industry.

The recent growth in the industry, particularly in Colorado, has attracted many businesses trying to enter the market. Some of our competitors have greater capital resources and facilities which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. Due to this competition, there is no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in generating revenues. If we are unable to successfully compete with existing companies and new entrants to the market, this will have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.

Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law.  Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse.  The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.  If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
As of February 28, 2017, 28 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use Medical Marijuana.  Additionally, voters in the states of Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, Nevada, Massachusetts, Maine and the District of Columbia approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for recreational use by adults.  The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The former Obama administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana.    However, the new Trump administration could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly.  Any such change in the federal governments enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders.  While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments or the enactment of new and more restrictive laws.

We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as the environmental laws and regulations of the foreign federal and local jurisdictions in which we have operations. We believe we are in material compliance with all such laws and regulations.

Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations.

Intellectual Property

Our intellectual property includes our managements knowledge and know-how relating to the legalized growth, production, manufacture, marketing, management, utilization and distribution of medical marijuana and marijuana infused products. It also includes a genetic catalogue including over 150 different strains of marijuana, and an advanced cannabinoid therapy program called A.C.T. Now.

We have also filed for utility patents related to the unique combinations of pharmaceutically active cannabinoids used to alleviate disorders of the nervous system, immune system and cancer with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office.
Employees

As of February 28, 2017, we had four employees. There is no union representation of our employees, and we have never experienced an involuntary work stoppage. We believe that our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Effect of Environmental Laws

We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as the environmental laws and regulations of the foreign federal and local jurisdictions in which we have operations. We believe we are in material compliance with all such laws and regulations.

Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations.
