In addition to our operating portfolio, as of December 31, 2016, we owned two properties where we have begun redevelopment activities.
Operating History
We are a Maryland corporation formed in March 2003 and have been publicly held and subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements since 2003. We were initially formed as Inland Western Retail Real Estate Trust, Inc. and on March 8, 2012, we changed our name to Retail Properties of America, Inc.
Business Objectives and Strategies
In 2012, management began a portfolio repositioning effort to focus the portfolio on high quality, multi-tenant retail properties. The core objective of this effort is to become a dominant owner of multi-tenant retail properties in 10 to 15 target markets, owning 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 square feet in each market. We believe that concentrating our portfolio in multi-tenant retail properties in these target markets will allow us to optimize our local and regional operating platforms and enhance our operating performance. To date, we have identified 10 target markets: Dallas, Washington, D.C./Baltimore, New York, Atlanta, Seattle, Chicago, Houston, San Antonio, Phoenix and Austin, which generally feature one or more of the following characteristics:

• | well-diversified local economy;


• | strong demographic profile with significant long-term population growth or above-average existing density, high disposable income and/or a highly educated employment base;


• | fiscal and regulatory environment conducive to business activity and growth;

1


• | strong barriers to entry, whether topographical, regulatory or density driven; and


• | ability to create critical mass and realize operational efficiencies.

Since the beginning of 2012, we have sold 159 properties, primarily in our non-target markets, for aggregate consideration of $2,296,955, including our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint ventures and three development properties, with a majority of the proceeds used for debt reduction and the acquisition of high quality, multi-tenant retail assets within our target markets. Since we began executing on our external growth initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2013, we have purchased 30 properties for aggregate consideration of $1,396,761, including our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint ventures, resulting in an increase in consolidated GLA in our target markets by 4.5 million square feet and an increase in concentration to over 66% of multi-tenant retail annualized base rent (ABR) from our target markets as of December 31, 2016. Depending on whether favorable market conditions exist, among other factors, we expect to substantially complete our portfolio repositioning efforts by the end of 2018.
Competition
In seeking new investment opportunities, we compete with other real estate investors, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors, real estate partnerships, private equity funds, private individuals and other real estate companies, some of which may have a lower cost of capital than ours.
From an operational perspective, we compete with other property owners on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, location, visibility, quality and aesthetic value of construction, and strength and name recognition of tenants. These factors combine to determine the level of occupancy and rental rates that we are able to achieve at our properties. Because our revenue potential may be linked to the success of retailers, we indirectly share exposure to the same competitive factors that our retail tenants experience when trying to attract customers. These factors include other forms of retailing, including e-commerce and direct consumer sales, and general competition from other regional shopping centers. To remain competitive, we evaluate all of the factors affecting our centers and work to position them accordingly. We believe the principal factors that retailers consider in making their leasing decisions include:

• | consumer demographics;


• | quality, design and location of properties;


• | diversity of retailers within individual shopping centers;


• | management and operational expertise of the landlord; and


• | rental rates.

Based on these factors, we believe that the size and scope of our property portfolio and operating platform, as well as the overall quality and attractiveness of our individual properties, enable us to compete effectively for retail tenants. We believe that our strategy of focusing on 10 to 15 target markets enhances our ability to drive revenue growth by more thoroughly understanding the local market dynamics and by increasing our market relevancy.
Tax Status
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the taxable income we distribute to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth and U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. We have one wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary that has jointly elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A TRS is taxed on its net income at regular corporate tax rates. The income tax expense incurred through the TRS has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Regulation
General
The properties in our portfolio, including common areas, are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations.
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
Our properties must comply with Title III of the ADA to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to allow access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe our existing properties are substantially in compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur significant capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding compliance with the ADA.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or release of hazardous substances, waste, or petroleum products at, on, in, under or from such property, including costs for investigation, remediation, natural resource damages or third party liability for personal injury or property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such materials, and the liability may be joint and several.
Independent environmental consultants conducted Phase I Environmental Site Assessments or similar environmental audits for all of our investment properties. A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment is a written report that identifies existing or potential environmental conditions associated with a particular property. These environmental site assessments generally involve a review of records and visual inspection of the property, but do not include soil sampling or ground water analysis. These environmental site assessments have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our operations. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding environmental matters.
Insurance
We carry comprehensive liability and property insurance coverage inclusive of fire, extended coverage, seismic activity, terrorism and loss of income insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket policy. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. We believe that the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured. Terrorism insurance is carried on all properties in an amount and with deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information. The terrorism insurance is subject to exclusions for loss or damage caused by nuclear substances, pollutants, contaminants and biological and chemical weapons. Insurance coverage is not provided for losses attributable to riots or certain acts of God.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 237 employees.
