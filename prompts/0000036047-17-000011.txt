Item 1. Business
The Company
We are a leading global property information, analytics and data-enabled services provider operating in North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific. Our vision is to deliver unique property-level insights that power the global real estate economy, differentiated by superior data, analytics and data-enabled solutions. Our mission is to empower our clients to make smarter decisions through data-driven insights.
Our combined data from public, contributory and proprietary sources provides detailed coverage of property, mortgages and other encumbrances, property risk and replacement cost, consumer credit, tenancy, location, hazard risk and related performance information. We have more than one million users who rely on our data and predictive decision analytics to reduce risk, enhance transparency and improve the performance of their businesses.
We offer our clients a comprehensive national database of public, contributory and proprietary data covering real property and mortgage information, judgments and liens, building and replacement costs, parcel and geospatial data, criminal background records, eviction information, non-prime lending records, credit information, and tax information, among other data types. Our databases include over 904 million historical property transactions, over 100 million mortgage applications and property-specific data covering approximately 99% of U.S. residential properties, as well as commercial locations, totaling nearly 150 million records. We are also the industry's first parcel-based geocoder and have developed a proprietary parcel database covering more than 140 million parcels across the U.S. We believe the quality of the data we offer is distinguished by our broad range of data sources and our expertise in aggregating, organizing, normalizing, processing and delivering data to our clients.
With our data as a foundation, we have built strong analytics capabilities and a variety of value-added business services to meet our clients’ needs for property tax processing, property valuation, mortgage and automotive credit reporting, tenancy screening, hazard risk, property risk and replacement cost, flood plain location determination and other geospatial data, analytics and related services.
We were originally incorporated in California in 1894, and were reincorporated in Delaware on June 1, 2010. Before June 1, 2010, we operated as The First American Corporation (“First American” or “FAC”) but, in connection with a transaction in which we spun off our financial services businesses (referred to as the "Separation"), we changed our name to CoreLogic, Inc. and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CLGX.” As used herein, the terms "CoreLogic," the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to CoreLogic, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, except where it is clear that the terms mean only CoreLogic, Inc. and not our subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located at 40 Pacifica, Irvine, California, 92618-7471, our telephone number is (949) 214-1000, and our website is www.corelogic.com.
Corporate Events
Acquisitions
In April 2016, we completed the acquisition of FNC Inc. ("FNC") for up to $475.0 million, with $400.0 million in cash paid at closing, subject to certain closing adjustments, and up to $75.0 million to be paid in cash in 2018, contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue targets in fiscal 2017. FNC is a leading provider of real estate collateral information technology and solutions that automates property appraisal ordering, tracking, documentation and review for lender compliance with government regulations and is included as a component of our Property Intelligence ("PI") reporting segment. The acquisition expands our property valuation capabilities.
In January 2016, we acquired the remaining 40% mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest in New Zealand-based Property IQ Ltd. ("PIQ") for NZD $27.8 million, or $19.0 million, and settled the mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest. PIQ is included as a component of our PI reporting segment.
Financing Activities
In November 2016, we paid down $45.0 million under the 7.55% senior debentures due 2028, which included a premium on debt extinguishment payment of $2.0 million.
 3

In July 2016, we amended and restated our senior secured credit facility, dated as of April 21, 2015 (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and other financial institutions, and borrowed an additional $525.0 million on our term loan facility under the Credit Agreement. Approximately $411.0 million of the proceeds were used to finance the redemption of all outstanding balances under the 7.25% senior notes due 2021 (the "Notes"), which included a premium on debt extinguishment payment of $14.2 million. The Notes had an aggregate principal amount of $393.0 million and were redeemed at a price equal to 103.63% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. We canceled the Notes upon their redemption. The remainder of the proceeds of the additional borrowing of approximately $110.0 million was used to pay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and the remaining approximate $4.0 million was retained by us as cash on hand.
Productivity & Cost Management
In line with our on-going commitment to operational excellence and margin expansion, we are targeting cost reduction of approximately $30.0 million in 2017. Savings are expected to be realized through the reduction of operating costs, selling, general and administrative costs, outsourcing certain business process functions, consolidation of facilities and other operational improvements.
Our Data
Our data is the foundation of many of our products, analytics and services. Our data can generally be categorized as property information, mortgage information and consumer information. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including but not limited to data gathered from public sources, data contributed by our clients and data obtained from data aggregators.
We gather a variety of data from public sources, including data and documents from federal, state and local governments. We enhance our public record information with the data we collect from other public and non-public sources to create comprehensive textual and geospatial views of each property within our coverage areas, including physical property characteristics, boundaries and tax values, current and historical ownership, voluntary and involuntary liens, tax assessments and delinquencies, replacement cost, property risk including environmental, flood and hazard information, criminal data, building permits, local trends, summary statistics and household demographics.
Our client agreements typically govern the use of our client-contributed data. These contractual arrangements often permit our clients to use our solutions which incorporate their data. We structure our client agreements to specify the particular uses of the data they contribute and to provide the required levels of data privacy and protection. Our contributed data includes loan performance information (from loan servicers, trustees, securitizers, issuers and others), appraisal information, mortgage, automotive, property rental and under-banked loan applications from various loan originators, landlords and property owners. 
In addition, we gather property listing and tenant/landlord rental information from Boards of Realtors®, real estate agents, brokers, landlords, and owners of multi-tenant properties. We collect appraisals and property valuations from appraisers and we license consumer credit history information from credit reporting agencies, lenders and auto dealers.
Business Segments and Solution Groups
We have organized our business into the following two segments: PI and Risk Management and Work Flow ("RMW"). The following table sets forth the key solutions we offer in each of these two segments:

Solutions
Property Intelligence
Our PI segment owns or licenses real property, mortgage and consumer information, which includes loan information, property sales and characteristic information, property risk and replacement cost, natural hazard data, geospatial data, parcel maps and mortgage-backed securities information. We have also developed proprietary technology and software platforms to access, automate or track this information and assist our clients with compliance regulations. We deliver this information directly to our clients in a standard format over the web, through customizable software platforms or in bulk data form. Our solutions include data licensing and analytics, data-enabled advisory services, platform solutions and valuation solutions in North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific.
Our data licensing and analytics solutions combine our real estate information with flood, demographics, crime, site inspection, neighborhood, document images and other information from proprietary sources to enable our clients to improve customer acquisition and retention, detect and prevent fraud, improve mortgage transaction cycle time and cost efficiency, identify real estate trends and neighborhood characteristics, track market performance and increase market share.
Our data-enabled advisory services assist our clients in detecting and preventing mortgage fraud and managing risk through a combination of patented predictive analytics and proprietary and contributed data. We also provide verification of applicant income, identity and certain employment verification services using Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and Social Security Administration databases as well as third-party employment data providers.
Our platform solutions maintain the leading market share of real estate listing software systems, with provisioning to more than 50% of all U.S. and Canadian real estate agents. Our flagship software platform is customizable to meet our clients’ needs while maintaining a single code base. We also provide a full range of professional services to listing organizations and assist our clients in identifying revenue opportunities and improving member services.
 5

Our valuation solutions consist of a variety of real estate valuation services to assist our clients in assessing risk of loss using alternative forms of property valuation. We have been building property valuation and collateral risk management models for more than 20 years and provide collateral information technology and solutions that automate property appraisal ordering, tracking, documentation and review for lender compliance with government regulations.
Risk Management and Work Flow
Our RMW segment owns or licenses real property information, mortgage information and consumer information, which includes loan information, property sales and characteristic information, natural hazard data, parcel maps, employment verification, criminal records and eviction records. We have also developed proprietary technology and software platforms to access, automate or track this information and assist our clients with compliance regulations. Our solutions include credit and screening, property tax processing, flood data services and technology solutions in North America.
Our credit and screening solutions have access to one of the largest consumer and business databases, which enables us to provide credit and income verification services to the mortgage, automotive and property rental and leasing industries. We provide comprehensive information about credit history, income verification, home address history, evictions, criminal records and additional proprietary types of information. We normalize our data to provide a broad range of advanced business information solutions designed to reduce risk and improve business performance. We also provide wholesale background data to the background screening industry.
Our property tax processing solutions are built from aggregated property tax information from over 20,000 taxing authorities. We use this information to advise mortgage originators and servicers of the property tax payment status on their loans and to monitor that status over the life of the loans. If a mortgage lender requires tax payments to be impounded on behalf of its borrowers, we can also monitor and oversee the transfer of these funds to the taxing authorities and provide the lender with payment confirmation.
Our flood data services provide flood zone determinations in accordance with the U.S. Federal legislation passed in 1994, which requires that most mortgage lenders obtain a determination of the current flood zone status at the time each loan is originated and obtain applicable updates during the life of the loan. We provide flood zone determinations primarily to mortgage lenders.
Our technology solutions provide software and workflow platforms to the financial services market through a comprehensive suite of enterprise lending automation services. Our solutions automate lending activities, consolidate functions and connect lenders with their partners and consumers in a collaborative, real-time environment in order to help lenders price, originate, fulfill and service consumer loans. We also provide a suite of compliance solutions that allow our clients to benefit from our specialists and their knowledge of our data to provide project-based or client-customized reports.
Clients
Our clients are predominantly financial services institutions in the mortgage and insurance industries. We provide our solutions to national and regional mortgage lenders, brokers, credit unions, commercial banks, investment banks, fixed-income investors, real estate agents, MLS companies, property management companies, real estate investment trusts, property and casualty insurance companies, government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises.
Our more significant client relationships tend to be long-term in nature and we typically provide a number of different solutions to each client. Because of the depth of these relationships, we derive a significant portion of our aggregate revenue from our largest clients, with 43.0% of our 2016 operating revenues being generated by our ten largest clients. Two of our clients accounted for 14.0% and 11.5% of our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. These clients were Wells Fargo and Bank of America, respectively. 
Competition
We offer a diverse array of specialized products and services that compete directly and indirectly with similar products and services offered by national and local providers. We believe there is no single competitor who offers the same combination of products and services that we do. Therefore, we find that we compete with a broad range of entities.
Our PI segment competes with entities that provide access to data or data-based analytical products and services as part of their product offerings, including Black Knight Financial Services, which provides real estate information, analytics, valuation related services and other solutions, RealtyTrac, which provides public records data, Clear Capital, which provides 
 6

valuation-related services, and Verisk Analytics, Inc., which provides data and risk assessment in the insurance and financial services space. We also compete with departments within financial institutions that utilize internal resources to provide similar analytics and services on a captive basis. We compete based on the breadth and quality of our data sets, the exclusive nature of some of our key data sets, the quality and effectiveness of our products and the integration of our platforms into client systems. We believe the data we offer is distinguished by quality, the broad range of our data sources (including non-public sources), the volume of records we maintain and our ability to provide data spanning a historical period of time that exceeds comparable data sets of most of our competitors.
Our RMW segment competes with third-party providers such as Black Knight Financial Services and Lereta LLC, which provide tax and flood services, as well as credit and screening solutions providers such as Equifax, Inc., Kroll Factual Data, RealPage, Inc. and Yardi Systems, Inc. For these services, we compete largely based on the quality of the products and services we provide, our ability to provide scalable services at competitive prices and our ability to provide integrated platforms. We also compete with departments within financial institutions that utilize internal resources to provide similar services on a captive basis. We generally compete with captive providers based on the quality of our products and services, the scalability of our services, cost efficiencies and our ability to provide some level of risk mitigation.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales strategy is client-focused and resources are primarily assigned based on client size and complexity. Several of our sales team members and subject matter experts specialize in specific products and services. Each of our sales executives develops and maintains key relationships within each client’s business units and plays an important role in relationship management as well as prospecting for new business. Our sales executives understand the current marketplace environment and demonstrate extensive knowledge of our clients’ internal operating structure and business needs. The depth and breadth of our relationships with our clients allows us to develop and implement solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of each client in a prompt and efficient manner.
Smaller clients, measured by revenue or geographic coverage, are primarily managed through our telesales operations, which are responsible for working with mortgage and real estate brokers, smaller property and casualty insurance companies, fixed-income investors, appraisers, real estate agents, correspondents and other lenders.
Several of our product and service lines have sales teams and subject matter experts who specialize in specific products and services. These sales teams and subject matter experts work collaboratively with our sales executives and our telesales operations to assist with client sales by combining our data, products and data-enabled services to meet the specific needs of each client. They may be assigned to assist with sales in targeted markets, for certain categories of clients or for particular service groups.
Our marketing strategy is to accelerate growth by building trusted relationships with our clients and delivering superior value through unique property-related data, analytics and data-enabled solutions. We use the most efficient methods available to successfully identify, target, educate and engage potential and existing clients to build awareness, familiarity and interest in our business solutions, demand for our products and services, and increase volume, quality and velocity of sales opportunities. Our marketing activities include direct marketing, advertising, public relations, event marketing, social media and other targeted activities.
 Acquisitions and Divestitures
Historically, we have accelerated our growth into new markets, products and services through acquisitions. We continually evaluate our business mix and opportunistically seek to optimize our business portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures.
Intellectual Property
We own significant intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent) and contractual safeguards in an intellectual property enforcement program to protect our intellectual property rights.
We have more than 50 issued patents in the U.S. covering business methods, software and systems patents, principally relating to automated valuation, fraud detection, data gathering, flood detection, MLS technology and property monitoring. We 
 7

also have approximately 60 patent applications pending in these and other areas in the U.S. In addition, we have a number of issued patents and pending patent applications internationally, including in Canada and Australia. The protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we intend to continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business.
In addition, we own more than 300 trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries, including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered. Many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks and logos are material to our business as they assist our clients in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
We own more than 1,000 registered copyrights in the U.S. and foreign countries, covering computer programs, reports and manuals. We also have other literary works, including marketing materials, handbooks, presentations and website contents that are protected under common law copyright. We believe our written materials are essential to our business as they provide our clients with insight into various areas of the financial and real estate markets in which we operate.
Our research and development activities focus primarily on the design and development of our analytical tools, software applications, and data sets. We expect to continue our practice of investing to develop new software applications and systems in response to the market and client needs we identify through client input collected in meetings, phone calls and web surveys. We also assess opportunities to cross-link existing data sets to enhance our products' effectiveness. 
In order to maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with our clients, granting rights to use our products and services, including our software and databases. We also audit our clients from time to time to ensure compliance with our agreements. This helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions. As a general practice, employees, contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.
Information Technology
Information technology is a significant focus area and we maintain a long-term strategic technology plan which is reassessed annually. Our information technology initiatives are driven by internal technology staff with support from a number of leading edge external technology firms. Our existing technology infrastructure is a private, dedicated cloud-based computing environment hosted in a primary and secondary technology center located in Quincy, Washington and Plano, Texas, respectively. These technology centers were formerly run by Dell and are now owned and managed by the NTT Data Corporation ("NTT").
We maintain a global innovation center ("GIC"), headquartered in Dallas, Texas, which is accountable for developing our next generation product platforms and software applications. In addition, the GIC plays a leading role in research and development in the areas of employing hardware advancements, data and analytics, mobility and the application of machine learning and mobility solutions. We supplement the GIC with a number of strategic partnerships, including most notably Pivotal Software, Inc.
Technology Operations
Our private, dedicated cloud computing environment hosted by NTT is designed to enable us to deliver secure and compliant data, analytics and services to support client needs. A secure and certified network of systems, combined with enterprise-level service operations, positions us as a leading property insights provider to the financial services market. Additionally, our platform stores, processes and delivers our data and our proprietary technologies that are the foundation of our business and critical to the development of our solutions. In conjunction with NTT, we operate a computing technology environment intended to allow us to provide flexible systems at all times, enabling us to deliver increased capacity as needed or when client needs demand increased speed of delivery. Additionally, our unified network architecture allows us to operate multiple systems as a single resource capable of delivering our applications, data and analytics as a combined solution to our clients.
Security
We have deployed a wide range of physical and technology security measures, along with a formal governance program, designed to secure our information technology infrastructure, personnel and data. Our governance program is based on extensive corporate information security policies, an information security awareness training program along with an 
 8

enterprise compliance program. Both our technology managers and NTT’s technology infrastructure managers are Information Technology Infrastructure Library certified. NTT is contractually obligated to comply with our information security policies and procedures. Our digital security framework provides layered protection designed to secure both active and inactive virtual machines in the data centers we use. This approach enables dedicated virtual machines to regularly scan all of our systems. These measures help to detect and prevent intrusions, monitor firewall integrity, inspect logs, catch and quarantine malware and prevent data breaches. Our physical and virtual security solutions run in tandem, enabling us to better identify suspicious activities and implement preventive measures.
Regulation
Various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal and state regulation. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide certain services, as well as the possible imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties. Among the more significant areas of regulation for our business are the following:
Privacy and Protection of Consumer Data
Because our business involves the collection, processing and distribution of personal public and non-public data, certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, foreign countries. These laws impose requirements regarding the collection, protection, use and distribution of some of the data we have, and provide for sanctions and penalties in the event of violations of these requirements.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA") regulates the sharing of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions. In addition to regulating the information sharing, the GLBA requires that non-public personal financial information be safeguarded using physical, administrative and technological means. Certain of the non-public personal information we hold is subject to protection under the GLBA.
The Drivers Privacy Protection Act prohibits the public disclosure, use or resale by any state's department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record, except for a “permissible purpose.”
Other federal and state laws also impose requirements relating to the privacy of information held by us. In addition, certain state laws may impose additional breach notice responsibilities in the event of the loss of data due to third-party security breaches, employee error, or other event resulting in persons gaining unauthorized access to our data.
The privacy and protection of consumer information remains a developing area and we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments at the federal, state and local level. 
Regulation of Credit Reporting Businesses
The Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") governs the practices of consumer reporting agencies that are engaged in the business of collecting and analyzing certain types of information about consumers, including credit eligibility information. The FCRA also governs the submission of information to consumer reporting agencies, the access to and use of information provided by consumer reporting agencies and the ability of consumers to access and dispute information held about them. A number of our databases and services are subject to regulation under the FCRA. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank Act") gave the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") supervisory authority over “larger participants” in the market for consumer financial services, as the CFPB defines by rule. In July 2012, the CFPB finalized its regulation regarding larger participants in the consumer reporting market. Under the regulation, certain of our credit businesses are considered larger participants. As a result, the CFPB has the authority to conduct examinations of the covered credit businesses, and we will continue to be examined by the CFPB as part of this authority.
Regulation of Settlement Services
The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ("RESPA") is enforced by the CFPB. RESPA generally prohibits the payment or receipt of fees or any other item of value for the referral of real estate-related settlement services. RESPA also prohibits fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services, 
 9

such as mortgage brokerage and real estate brokerage. Notwithstanding these prohibitions, RESPA permits payments for goods furnished or for services actually performed, so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided. Our mortgage origination-related businesses and joint venture entities that supply credit reports, flood and tax services, valuation products, and all other settlement services to residential mortgage lenders are structured and operated in a manner intended to comply with RESPA and related regulations.
Regulation of Property Valuation Activities
Real estate appraisals and Automated Valuation Models ("AVMs") are subject to federal and/or state regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented rules and guidance thereunder, and inter-agency guidance jointly issued by the federal financial institution regulators have expanded regulation of these activities. Regulations address appraisals, AVMs and other forms of property value estimates, which are subject to explicit and detailed regulations including licensing, pricing and quality control requirements, and creditors are required to disclose to applicants information about the purpose, and provide consumers with a free copy, of any appraisal, AVM or other estimate of a home's value developed in connection with a residential real estate mortgage loan application.
In addition, the increased regulation of the residential mortgage lending industry has created opportunities for expanded use of property valuation tools. We have introduced new products to pursue these opportunities.
Regulation and Potential Examination by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Federal Financial Institution Regulators
The CFPB now serves as the principal federal regulator of providers of consumer financial products and services. As such, the CFPB has significant rulemaking authority under existing federal statutes (including the FCRA, the GLBA, and RESPA), as well as the authority to conduct examinations of certain providers of financial products and services. As discussed above, under the CFPB's authority to supervise larger market participants of the credit reporting market, the CFPB has the authority to conduct examinations of us. The CFPB also has the authority to initiate an investigation of our other businesses if it believes that a federal consumer financial law is being violated. Additionally, in early 2013, the CFPB issued several regulations that, although not directly applicable to us, potentially could present regulatory risk to us in our role as a service provider to providers of financial products and services. These regulations include the CFPB's Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards, Mortgage Servicing Rules, Escrow Requirements for Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans, Appraisal Requirements for Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans, Loan Originator Compensation Requirements, Disclosure and Delivery Requirements for Copies of Appraisals and Other Written Valuations, and High-Cost Mortgage and Homeownership Counseling Requirements. The CFPB issued additional regulations in December 2013 that mandated integrated mortgage disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act and RESPA beginning in October 2015. The CFPB issued new regulations in October 2015 that expand the types of data lenders are required to provide under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which regulations become effective January 1, 2018. We have evaluated the impact of these regulations on the services we provide and, where necessary, adjusted our products and services to conform to the new requirements.
The Bank Service Company Act permits the regulators of federal financial institutions to examine vendors, such as us, that provide outsourced services to their regulated entities. Similarly, the CFPB can conduct examinations of service providers to institutions under the supervision of the CFPB if that service provider provides a "material service" to the institution. As a result, most of our businesses could be examined by the CFPB or a federal banking regulator as a service provider to banks and other financial institutions.
In addition, settlement agreements entered into between the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and a number of our largest clients related to mortgage servicing practices increase the likelihood that providers of certain outsourced services will be examined by the OCC. In February 2012, 49 state attorneys general and the federal government announced a joint state-federal settlement with the country's five largest mortgage servicers known as the National Mortgage Settlement. As part of the settlement, the affected mortgage servicers agreed to a set of strict servicing standards that require, among other things, a single point of contact for delinquent consumers, adequate staffing levels and training, better communication with borrowers, and appropriate standards for executing documents in foreclosure cases, ending improper fees, and ending dual-track foreclosures for many loans. The CFPB has codified the majority of these standards in its Mortgage Servicing Rules issued in final form on January 17, 2013. We must comply with these rules, which became effective on January 10, 2014, when supplying certain services to our servicer clients. Moreover, the OCC and other federal regulators have issued guidance encouraging greater supervision of third-party relationships by regulated entities. This increased level of scrutiny may cause an increase in the cost of compliance for us.
 10

Enhanced regulation in the area of financial as well as personal data privacy is possible and could significantly impact some of our business practices because this is an area where both the FTC and the CFPB have jurisdiction. It is too early to assess the financial and operational impact to our business of this heightened regulation, if adopted.
In addition to the foregoing areas of regulation, several of our other businesses are subject to regulation, including the following:

• | Our tenant screening business is subject to certain landlord-tenant laws;


• | Our loan document business must monitor state laws applicable to our clients relating to loan documents and fee limitations as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac requirements to develop and maintain compliant loan documents and other instruments; and


• | Our activities in foreign jurisdictions are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and comparable foreign laws.

We do not believe that compliance with current and future laws and regulations related to our businesses, including consumer protection laws and regulations, will have a material adverse effect on us, but such activities will likely increase our compliance costs.
Other Regulations
The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and similar state laws may apply to loss mitigation activities and lien release statutes affect some document processing we conduct on behalf of servicers. In addition, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair deceptive or abusive acts may apply to our services. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 6,300 employees, of which approximately 5,600 were employed in the U.S. and 700 outside the U.S.
Available Information
We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. 
Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are also available free of charge through the "Investors" page on our Internet site at http://www.corelogic.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part hereof or incorporated into this or any of our other filings with the SEC. 
Item  1A.  Risk Factors.
Risks Related to Our Business

1. | We depend on our ability to access data from external sources to maintain and grow our businesses. If we are unable to access needed data from these sources or if the prices charged for these services increase, the quality, pricing and availability of our products and services may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We rely extensively upon data from a variety of external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data from third-party suppliers, various government and public record sources and data contributed by our clients. Our data sources could cease providing or reduce the availability of their data to us, increase the price we pay for their data, or limit our use of their data for a variety of reasons, including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use. If a number of suppliers are no longer able or are unwilling to provide us with certain data, or if our public record sources of data 
 11

become unavailable or too expensive, we may need to find alternative sources. If we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and efficiently and effectively integrate these data sources into our service offerings, we could experience service disruptions, increased costs and reduced quality of our services. Moreover, some of our suppliers compete with us in certain product offerings, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases from them. Significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins and our financial position, in particular if we are unable to arrange for substitute sources of data on favorable economic terms. Loss of such access or the availability of data in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all may reduce the quality and availability of our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

2. | Our clients and we are subject to various governmental regulations, and a failure to comply with government regulations or changes in these regulations could result in penalties, restrict or limit our or our clients' operations or make it more burdensome to conduct such operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.

Many of our and our clients' businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could restrict our ability to provide certain services or result in the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties, substantial regulatory and compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity and loss of revenue.
In addition, our businesses are subject to an increasing degree of compliance oversight by regulators and by our clients. Specifically, the CFPB has authority to write rules affecting the business of consumer reporting agencies and also to supervise, conduct examinations of, and enforce compliance as to federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations with respect to certain “non-depository covered persons” determined by the CFPB to be “larger participants” that offer consumer financial products and services. Two of our credit businesses - CoreLogic Credco and Teletrack - are subject to the CFPB non-bank supervision program. The CFPB and the prudential financial institution regulators such as the OCC also have the authority to examine us in our role as a service provider to large financial institutions, although it is yet unclear how broadly they will apply this authority going forward. In addition, several of our largest bank clients are subject to consent orders with the OCC and/or are parties to the National Mortgage Settlement, both of which require them to exercise greater oversight and perform more rigorous audits of their key vendors such as us.
These laws and regulations (as well as laws and regulations in the various states or in other countries) could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in, impose additional costs or restrictions on us, result in significant loss of revenue, impact the value of assets we hold, or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business. In addition, this increased level of scrutiny may increase our compliance costs.
Our operations could be negatively affected by changes to laws and regulations and enhanced regulatory oversight of our clients and us. These changes may compel us to increase our prices in certain situations or decrease our prices in other situations, may restrict our ability to implement price increases, and may limit the manner in which we conduct our business or otherwise may have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenues, earnings and cash flows. If we are unable to adapt our products and services to conform to the new laws and regulations, or if these laws and regulations have a negative impact on our clients, we may experience client losses or increased operating costs, and our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.

3. | Regulatory developments with respect to use of consumer data and public records could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Because our databases include certain public and non-public personal information concerning consumers, we are subject to government regulation and potential adverse publicity concerning our use of consumer data. We acquire, store, use and provide many types of consumer data and related services that are subject to regulation under the FCRA, the GLBA, and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act and, to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of consumers and to prevent the unauthorized access and misuse of personal information in the marketplace. Our failure to comply with these laws, or any future laws or regulations of a similar nature, could result in substantial regulatory penalties, litigation expense and loss of revenue.
In addition, some of our data suppliers face similar regulatory requirements and, consequently, they may cease to be able to provide data to us or may substantially increase the fees they charge us for this data which may make it financially burdensome or impossible for us to acquire data that is necessary to offer our products and services. Further, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect 
 12

privacy or ensure the accuracy of consumer-related data. As a result, they are seeking further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors as well as contemplating requirements relative to data accuracy and the ability of consumers to opt to have their personal data removed from databases such as ours. Any future laws, regulations or other restrictions limiting the dissemination or use of personal information may reduce the quality and availability of our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

4. | If we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or if we are unable to provide adequate security in the electronic transmission of sensitive data, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for business-to-business and business-to-consumer electronic commerce. Security breaches of this infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information and consumer data. Unauthorized access, including through use of fraudulent schemes such as "phishing" schemes, could jeopardize the security of information stored in our systems. In addition, malware or viruses could jeopardize the security of information stored or used in a user's computer. If we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss, lawsuits and other regulatory imposed restrictions and penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive consumer data.
Likewise, our clients are increasingly imposing more stringent contractual obligations on us relating to our information security protections. If we are unable to maintain protections and processes at a level commensurate with that required by our clients, it could negatively affect our relationships with those clients or increase our operating costs, which could harm our business or reputation.

5. | We rely on our top ten clients for a significant portion of our revenue and profit, which makes us susceptible to the same macro-economic and regulatory factors that our clients face. If these clients are negatively impacted by current economic or regulatory conditions or otherwise experience financial hardship or stress, or if the terms of our relationships with these clients change, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our ten largest clients generated approximately 43% of our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, and two of our largest clients each generated over 10% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect that a limited number of our clients will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future, and that our concentration of revenue with one or more clients may continue to be significant or increase. These clients face continued pressure in the current economic and regulatory climate. Many of our relationships with these clients are long-standing and are important to our future operating results, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements or maintain our relationships on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, in response to increased regulatory oversight, clients in the mortgage lending industry may have internal policies that require them to use multiple vendors or service providers, thereby causing a diversification of revenue among many vendors. Deterioration in or termination of any of these relationships, including through vendor diversification policies or merger or consolidation among our clients, could significantly reduce our revenue and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain of our businesses have higher client concentration than our company as a whole. As a result, these businesses may be disproportionately affected by declining revenue from, or loss of, a significant client.

6. | Systems interruptions may impair the delivery of our products and services, causing potential client and revenue loss.

System interruptions may impair the delivery of our products and services, resulting in a loss of clients and a corresponding loss in revenue. Our technology infrastructure runs primarily in a private dedicated cloud-based environment hosted in NTT's technology center in Quincy, WA. We cannot be sure that certain systems interruptions or events beyond our control, including issues with NTT's technology center or our third-party network and infrastructure providers or in connection with our upgrading or replatforming key systems, will not interrupt or terminate the delivery of our products and services to our clients. These interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers' ability to provide necessary data to us and our employees' ability to attend to work and perform their responsibilities. Any of these possible outcomes could result in a loss of clients or a loss in revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business or operations.
 13


7. | Because our revenue from clients in the mortgage, consumer lending and real estate industries is affected by the strength of the economy and the housing market generally, including the volume of real estate transactions, a negative change in any of these conditions could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

A significant portion of our revenue is generated from solutions we provide to the mortgage, consumer lending and real estate industries and, as a result, a weak economy or housing market or adverse changes in the interest rate environment may adversely affect our business. The volume of mortgage origination and residential real estate transactions is highly variable. Reductions in these transaction volumes could have a direct impact on certain portions of our revenues and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, negative economic conditions and/or increasing interest rate environments could affect the performance and financial condition of some of our clients in many of our businesses, which may lead to negative impacts on our revenue, earnings and liquidity in particular if these clients go bankrupt or otherwise exit certain businesses. 

8. | Our acquisition and integration of businesses may involve increased expenses, and may not produce the desired financial or operating results contemplated at the time of the transaction.

We have acquired and expect to continue to acquire, on an opportunistic basis, companies, businesses, products and services. These activities may increase our expenses, and the expected results, synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned. While management believes that acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, no assurance can be given that acquisitions will be successful or accretive to earnings.
In addition, we may have difficulty integrating our completed or any future acquisitions into our operations, including implementing at the acquired companies controls, procedures and policies in line with our controls, procedures and policies. If we fail to properly integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies and personnel, it could impair relationships with employees, clients and strategic partners, distract management attention from our core businesses, result in control failures and otherwise disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations. We also may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition. Although part of our business strategy may include growth through strategic acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, obtain the capital necessary to pursue acquisitions or complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms. 
9.  We operate in a competitive business environment, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
The markets for our products and services are intensely competitive. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. We compete for existing and new clients against both third parties and the in-house capabilities of our clients. Many of our competitors have substantial resources. Some have widely-used technology platforms that they seek to use as a competitive advantage to drive sales of other products and services. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies. These competitors and new technologies may be disruptive to our existing technology or service offerings, resulting in operating inefficiencies and increased competitive pressure. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors. Any competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

10. | Our reliance on outsourcing arrangements subjects us to risk and may disrupt or adversely affect our operations. In addition, we may not realize the full benefit of our outsourcing arrangements, which may result in increased costs, or may adversely affect our service levels for our clients.

Over the last few years, we have outsourced various business process and information technology services to third parties, including the outsourcing arrangements we entered into with a subsidiary of Cognizant Technology Solutions and the technology infrastructure management services agreement we entered into with NTT. Although we have service-level arrangements with our providers, we do not ultimately control their performance, which may make our operations vulnerable to their performance failures. In addition, the failure to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third-party vendors could subject us to additional risk. Reliance on third parties also makes us vulnerable to changes in the vendors' business, financial condition and other matters outside of our control, including their violations of laws or regulations which could increase our exposure to liability or otherwise increase the costs associated with the operation of our business. The failure of our outsourcing partners to perform as expected or as contractually required could result in significant disruptions and costs 
 14

to our operations and to the services we provide to our clients, which could materially and adversely affect our business, client relationships, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. 


11. | Our international service providers and our own international operations subject us to additional risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and may impair our ability to operate effectively.

Over the last few years, we have reduced our costs by utilizing lower-cost labor outside the U.S. in countries such as India and the Philippines through outsourcing arrangements. It is likely that the countries where our outsourcing vendors are located may be subject to higher degrees of political and social instability than the U.S. and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. Such disruptions could impact our ability to deliver our products and services on a timely basis, if at all, and to a lesser extent could decrease efficiency and increase our costs. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar in relation to the currencies used and higher inflation rates experienced in these countries may also reduce the savings we planned to achieve. Furthermore, the practice of utilizing labor based in foreign countries has come under increased scrutiny in the U.S. and, as a result, many of our clients may require us to use labor based in the U.S. We may not be able to pass on the increased costs of higher-priced U.S.-based labor to our clients, which ultimately could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
In addition, the U.S. or the foreign countries in which we have service provider arrangements or operate could adopt new legislation or regulations that would adversely affect our business by making it difficult, more costly or impossible for us to continue our foreign activities as currently being conducted. Furthermore, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the FCPA. Any violations of FCPA or local anti-corruption laws by us, our subsidiaries or our local agents could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation and result in substantial financial penalties or other sanctions.

12. | We rely upon proprietary technology and information rights, and if we are unable to protect our rights, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.

Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying, distribution and creation of derivative products to protect our proprietary technology and information. This protection is limited, and our intellectual property could be used by others without our consent. In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Any infringement, disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be time-consuming, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

13. | If our products or services are found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties.

As we continue to develop and expand our products and services, we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims from third parties such as non-practicing entities, software providers or suppliers of data. Likewise, if we are unable to maintain adequate controls over how third-party software and data are used we may be subject to claims of infringement. Any claims, whether with or without merit, could:

• | be expensive and time-consuming to defend;


• | cause us to cease making, licensing or using applications that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;


• | require us to redesign our applications, if feasible;


• | divert management's attention and resources; and


• | require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies.


14. | Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from complying with our covenants and obligations under our outstanding debt instruments. Further, the instruments governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that could limit our operating flexibility.

As of December 31, 2016, our total debt was approximately $1.6 billion and we had unused commitments of approximately $248.0 million under our Revolving Facility. In July 2016, we completed $525.0 million of incremental term 
 15

loan borrowings through an amendment to our Credit Agreement. A portion of the proceeds of the new borrowings were used to complete the redemption of all outstanding balances under the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest for approximately $411.0 million. The remaining portion of the proceeds were utilized to reduce our outstanding balance under the Revolving Facility.

Subject to the limitations contained in the Credit Agreement governing our credit facilities and our other debt instruments, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other general corporate purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could increase. Specifically, our level of debt could have important consequences to us, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and compromising our flexibility to capitalize our business opportunities and to plan for, or react to, competitive pressures and changes in our business or market conditions.
The Credit Agreement governing our credit facilities imposes operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions include the financial covenants in our credit facilities which require ongoing compliance with certain financial tests and ratios, including a minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio, and could limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:

• | create, incur or assume additional debt;


• | create, incur or assume certain liens;


• | redeem and/or prepay certain subordinated debt we might issue in the future;


• | pay dividends on our stock or repurchase stock;


• | make certain investments and acquisitions, including joint ventures;


• | enter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;


• | enter into new lines of business;


• | engage in consolidations, mergers and acquisitions;


• | engage in specified sales of assets; and


• | enter into transactions with affiliates.

These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could impact our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us. Our failure to comply with these restrictions could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all our debt.
15.  We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt instruments, which may not be successful.
Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and the lenders under our credit facilities could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and could terminate their revolving commitments to loan money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

16. | We may not be able to attract and retain qualified management or develop current management to assist in or lead company growth, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain or expand our product and service offerings.

We rely on skilled management and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of such individuals. If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. We compete for talented individuals not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of individuals who have the skills and training needed to grow our company, especially in the increasingly-regulated environment in which we operate. Increased attrition or competition for qualified management could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and product offerings, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.

17. | We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of prior acquisitions and an impairment of these investments would require a write-down that would reduce our net income.

 16

Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually or sooner if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends. In the event that the book value of goodwill is impaired, any such impairment would be charged to earnings in the period of impairment. In the event of significant volatility in the capital markets or a worsening of current economic conditions, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Possible future impairment of goodwill may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
18. We may not be able to effectively achieve our cost-containment or growth strategies, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
Our ability to execute on our cost-containment and growth strategies depends in part on maintaining our competitive advantage with current solutions in new and existing markets, as well as our ability to develop new technologies and solutions to serve such markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to realize all of the projected benefits of our cost-containment plans or that we will be able to compete successfully in new markets or continue to compete effectively in our existing markets. In addition, development of new technologies and solutions may require significant investment by us. If we fail to introduce new technologies or solutions on a cost-effective or timely basis, or if we are not successful in introducing or obtaining regulatory or market acceptance for new solutions, we may lose market share and our results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.

19. | We share responsibility with First American for certain income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the date of the Separation.

Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, by and between FAC and FAFC, dated as of June 1, 2010 (the "Tax Sharing Agreement") we entered into in connection with the Separation transaction, we are generally responsible for taxes attributable to our business, assets and liabilities and FAFC is generally responsible for all taxes attributable to members of the FAFC group of companies and the assets, liabilities or businesses of the FAFC group of companies. Generally, any liabilities arising from tax adjustments to consolidated tax returns for tax periods prior to and including the date of the Separation will be shared in proportion to each company's percentage of the tax liability for the relevant year (or partial year with respect to 2010), unless the adjustment is attributable to either party, in which case the adjustment will generally be for the account of such party. In addition to this potential liability associated with adjustments for prior periods, if FAFC were to fail to pay any tax liability it is required to pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such tax liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreed-upon share of tax liabilities.

20. | If certain transactions, including internal transactions, undertaken in anticipation of the Separation are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and FAFC will incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

In connection with the Separation we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that, among other things, certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Separation will qualify for favorable treatment under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), and the contribution by us of certain assets of the financial services businesses to FAFC and the pro-rata distribution to our shareholders of the common stock of FAFC will, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In addition, we received opinions of tax counsel to similar effect. The ruling and opinions relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and FAFC regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the Separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that were not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or FAFC after the Separation. If the Separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, we and our stockholders that are subject to income tax could incur significant income tax liabilities.
 17

In addition, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, in the event a transaction were determined to be taxable and such determination were the result of actions taken after the Separation by us or FAFC, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or FAFC as a result thereof. 
Moreover, the Tax Sharing Agreement generally provides that each party thereto is responsible for any taxes imposed on the other party as a result of the failure of the distribution to qualify as a tax-free transaction under the Code if such failure is attributable to post-Separation actions taken by or in respect of the responsible party or its stockholders, regardless of when the actions occur after the Separation, and the other party consents to such actions or such party obtains a favorable letter ruling or opinion of tax counsel as described above. 

21. | In connection with the Separation, we entered into a number of agreements with FAFC setting forth rights and obligations of the parties post-Separation. In addition, certain provisions of these agreements provide protection to FAFC in the event of a change of control of us, which could reduce the likelihood of a potential change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable.

In connection with the Separation, we and FAFC entered into a number of agreements that set forth certain rights and obligations of the parties post-Separation, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement and the Restrictive Covenants Agreement. We possess certain rights under those agreements, including without limitation indemnity rights from certain liabilities allocated to FAFC. The failure of FAFC to perform its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
In addition, the Separation and Distribution Agreement gives FAFC the right to purchase the equity or assets of our entity or entities directly or indirectly owning the real property databases that we currently own upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. The triggering events include the direct or indirect purchase of the databases by a title insurance underwriter (or its affiliate) or an entity licensed as a title insurance underwriter, including a transaction where a title insurance underwriter (or its affiliate) acquires 25% or more of us. The purchase right expires June 1, 2020. Until the expiration of the purchase right, this provision could have the effect of limiting or discouraging an acquisition of us or preventing a change of control that our stockholders might consider favorable. Likewise, if a triggering event occurs, the loss of ownership of our real property database could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.
