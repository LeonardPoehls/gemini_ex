Ballantyne is a Delaware corporation which was founded in 1932 and became a designer and manufacturer of film projectors. For more than 85 years, we have expanded our product lines and services to meet the needs of the ever-changing and technologically-advancing theater exhibition industry. Most recently, we entered the digital media sector through an acquisition which enables us to serve the advertising, education and communication needs of retail, corporate, and government markets. Ballantyne went public in 1995; our shares are traded on the NYSE American market under the symbol “BTN.”
 
We conduct our operations through two primary business segments: Cinema and Digital Media. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we decided to reorganize our segments to move the operations of Strong Technical Services, Inc. from the Digital Media segment to the Cinema segment. All prior periods have been recast in our segment reporting to reflect the current segment organization.
 
Strategy
 
Our Board of Directors has implemented a strategy focused on making optimal capital allocation decisions across all of the Company’s businesses and investments. The Board intends to consider and make investments in the Company’s existing Cinema and Digital Media businesses when attractive opportunities arise. The Board also intends to consider and make investments in other industries that are expected to produce higher returns on invested capital. This may involve investments in public companies or the complete acquisitions of other businesses, which may be within or outside of the Company’s existing markets. We intend our investments in public companies to be made in circumstances where we believe that we will be able to exercise some degree of influence or control.
 
The Company now holds investments in several public companies. These investments include RELM Wireless Corporation (NYSE American: RWC), a manufacturer of two-way wireless radio communications equipment, 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: PIH), a provider of property and casualty insurance in the States of Louisiana, Texas and Florida, and Itasca Capital Ltd. (TSX Venture: ICL), a holding company that holds a significant position in Limbach Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: LMB), a leading commercial provider of HVAC construction and related services. As of December 31, 2017, the Company holds approximately 8.3% of the outstanding stock of RELM Wireless Corporation, approximately 17.4% of the outstanding stock of 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc., and approximately 32.3% of the outstanding stock of Itasca Capital Ltd.
 
Fundamental Global Investors, LLC, the funds that it manages, its other affiliates, and the directors, officers and employees of the Company and their affiliates together currently hold approximately 41.2% of the Company’s outstanding stock. In some cases, funds managed by Fundamental Global Investors, LLC may acquire positions in the same public companies as the Company. Fundamental Global Investors’ funds currently hold positions in both RELM Wireless Corporation and 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc.
 
In addition to the Company’s operating businesses and investments in public companies, the Board expects to consider investments and transactions in other areas that it believes are likely to increase returns to shareholders, such as continued stock buybacks and monetizing physical or other assets held by the company.
 
The Board expects that over time the Company will be further transformed into a holding company with ownership of and investments in diverse businesses.

We market and sell directly to theater exhibitors, as well as through certain domestic and international Value Added Resellers (“VAR”). Over the course of our 85-year history, we have developed ongoing customer relationships with a large portion of the theater owners in the United States and a number of the major theater owners internationally. Our sales and marketing staff principally develop business by maintaining regular personal contact with our established customer relationships, including conducting site visits. In our sales and marketing efforts, we emphasize our value proposition of providing the broadest range of products and services delivered by one of the industry’s largest technical service teams, which provides a significant resource to our clients in managing the complexities of digital technology in the cinema exhibition industry. Our sales and marketing professionals have extensive experience with the Company’s product lines and have long-term relationships throughout the industry.
 
Products
 
Screens — We manufacture multiple standard and large format 2D and 3D screens for cinema and special venue applications through our ISO-certified manufacturing facility in Canada. There are certain digital 3D applications, such as the technology by RealD, that require unique “silver” screens that we manufacture. In addition, we purchased Peintures Elite, Inc. in 2013, the manufacturer of coatings that have been exclusive to our Company in the manufacture of our screens. This relatively small acquisition positioned us to retain the exclusive rights to this coating and to continue producing our unique screens. We are constantly innovating to set new standards within the screen industry, and in 2013 we developed the new Premium HGA screen that diffuses light more evenly over the entire screen surface, thereby reducing the formation of so-called “hot spots.”
 
Screen Support Systems — Our custom screen support structures are designed and built with quality and safety as a priority. They are easy to assemble, require no scaffolding and each one includes detailed and easy to understand installation instructions. Our mechanical design and engineering team supervises every step of the process, from design to manufacturing, at one location.
 
Projectors — Through distribution agreements with NEC and Barco, we distribute DLP Cinema projectors in the Americas. Both manufacturers of the projectors use the DLP cinema technology from Texas Instruments. NEC offers DLP Cinema projectors ranging from their NC900 projector for screens up to 31 feet wide to the NC3240S, which is a 4K projector designed for screens up to 105 feet wide. Barco offers DLP Cinema projectors ranging from their DP2K-10SX projector for screens up to 33 wide feet to the DP4K-32B cinema projector, which is an ultra-bright enhanced 4K cinema projector for screens up to 105 feet wide.
 
Servers — Through a formal distribution agreement with GDC Technology (USA), LLC, we distribute GDC’s line of digital cinema servers in North and South America. We also distribute their servers in certain other areas of the world under less formal arrangements. In addition, we distribute servers for other server manufacturers, including those manufactured by Dolby. Digital servers and the related integrated media block are used by our customers for the storage and delivery of digital movie content.
 
Audio Systems — We distribute a range of state of the art digital audio systems, including surround and 3D sound technologies from the following manufacturers: Dolby, Barco, USL, JBL and QSC. Our technicians are certified by each manufacturer to install, service and maintain these and other audio systems.
 
Additional Projection Products — We also distribute certain third-party accessories, which when coupled with the cinema projector, server and integrated media block, can fully outfit and automate a projection booth. The significant accessories include, but are not limited to, library management systems, automation products, pedestals, 3D accessories, lenses and lamps.
 
Technical Services
 
Network Operations Center — Our Network Operations Centers (“NOC”), staffed by software engineers and systems techs, operate 24/7/365 and provide technical support to our customers to meet Service Level Agreements (“SLA”). From each location in Alpharetta, GA and Omaha, NE, we are able to monitor our customers’ networked equipment remotely, often providing proactive solutions to systems issues before they cause system failures. Our remote services include systems monitoring and maintenance, software upgrades and system repairs. By utilizing NOC personnel to solve customer issues whenever possible, we eliminate travel time and expenses normally incurred by sending a technician onsite for repairs. Many issues that do not involve parts replacement or physical contact with the hardware can be handled remotely using our remote assistance technologies.

Onsite Service and Maintenance — We provide digital cinema equipment installations and after-sale maintenance services. Our onsite technicians work closely with our NOC staff to resolve systems issues that cannot be fixed remotely; they are certified to install and service a wide array of digital and audio equipment from a number of manufacturers. We offer cabling, wiring, installation and maintenance services for digital equipment on ad hoc, as-needed basis. We also offer long-term contractual service packages for maintenance and repairs to a wide range of installed digital equipment for customers. These long-term contractual service packages provide our Company with recurring revenue.
 
Markets
 
We sell our screen systems worldwide, with our primary markets being North America and Asia.
 
Our non-exclusive distribution agreements with NEC and Barco allow us to market digital projectors in North and South America, including the Caribbean. In China we have distribution rights to sell Barco. We do not have any territorial restrictions for any of our other products and services.
 
We provide Cinema technical services in the United States. We market and sell our services directly to theater owners and through dealers or VAR networks.
 
Competition
 
Screens and Screen Support Systems –While there are numerous screen manufacturing companies, the primary competitor in the worldwide cinema screen market is Harkness Screens. Competitive factors include product performance characteristics, quality, availability and price.
 
Digital Projection Equipment — The markets for our products in the Cinema segment have been highly competitive. The primary competitive factors are price, product quality, features and customer support. Competition in the digital cinema equipment market includes one other licensed original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the Texas Instruments’ DLP cinema technology besides our partners NEC and Barco: Christie Digital Systems. We also compete with Sony, which uses its own 4K digital cinema technology.
 
Technical Services – The competition in the cinema service industry for installation, after-sale maintenance, and NOC services is primarily driven by the two largest cinema service companies: the Company and Christie Digital, although there are other smaller scale providers.

Digital Media
 
Overview
 
The Company delivers digital signage solutions and services across two primary markets: digital out-of-home and enterprise video. In 2018, we will also begin providing advertising services as described below. These markets are served through the capabilities that we developed from the acquisition of Convergent in 2013. While there is digital signage equipment sold within this segment, the primary focus of this segment is providing solutions and services to our customers.
Solutions
 
Digital Signage – Our industry-first Digital Signage as a Service gives customers an end-to-end solution that includes hardware, software, content distribution, management, network monitoring and field services, all for a single monthly fee. Our “as-a-service” model lowers up-front customer capital costs, allows customers to scale more easily and allows them to ‘turn on’ or ‘turn-off’ features as needed. It also eliminates the risk of investing in quickly changing technologies, removes complexity and lessens resource burdens typically associated with traditional digital signage systems. We primarily market our solutions to large businesses in North America that do not have the resources, expertise or desire to create, manage and maintain their digital signage system internally. Customers typically require deployment across many locations and utilize digital signage to increase product sales, improve the consumer experience, enhance their brand or engage their audience.
 
Enterprise Video – We provide video communication services and solutions, including design, integration, monitoring, maintenance and installation for the government and corporate markets. These solutions provide enterprises with the infrastructure necessary to communicate, collaborate, train and educate employees.
 
Advertising – During the first quarter of 2018, we signed an agreement to provide advertising services on over 3,500 New York City taxicabs. The advertising will be on a combination of vinyl printed signs and digital signs. We have leased 300 digital signs, which we expect to install during the first half of 2018. The remainder of the taxicabs will initially feature print advertising. We expect to convert more taxicabs to digital signs over time.
 
Products and Services
 
Digital Signage as a Service (DSaaS) Platform – Our platform leverages internally developed and third-party software to automate the customer’s digital signage workflow, including from content creation, approval, storage and management, network deployment, monitoring, case management and incident resolution. Since it is cloud-based, it provides inherent scalability to enable customers to expand or contract their network. The DSaaS platform supports a wide range of applications – all of which are managed through a single user interface. New features and functionality are frequently added, both through the efforts of our in-house software development team and integration with an ever-growing ecosystem of third-party applications.
 
Content Creation – We provide creative services to digital signage clients that include media strategy, content design and production. Our creative services team develops custom content to support the branding and marketing initiatives of each client.
 
Content Management and Distribution – Content management is provided to ensure accurate playback at the right place and at the right time based on a number of factors such as geography, site characteristics, location within a site or consumer demographics. We utilize our DSaaS platform for the management and distribution of content. Content is prepared, scheduled and centrally distributed from our cloud infrastructure.
 
Network Operations Center – Our NOC in Alpharetta, GA provides similar services to our Digital Media customers as described under Cinema above.
 
Service and Maintenance — We provide digital signage installations and after-sale maintenance services. Our onsite technicians work closely with our NOC staff to resolve systems issues that cannot be fixed remotely; they are certified to install and service a wide array of digital and audio equipment from a number of manufacturers. We offer cabling, wiring, installation and maintenance services for digital menu boards and other digital equipment on ad hoc, as-needed basis. We also offer long-term contractual service packages for maintenance and repairs to digital signage equipment. These long-term contractual service packages provide our Company with recurring revenue.

Network Connectivity – We offer nationwide internet connectivity to fulfill content distribution and network management functions. We utilize third party providers for traditional terrestrial connectivity, as well as wireless service across North America.
 
Measurement and Analytics – We offer the tools and resources to measure the impact of digital signage solutions. We develop measurement criteria, establish benchmarks and identify control mechanisms to test the effectiveness of such solutions during proof of concept and full rollout scenarios.
 
Markets
 
Digital Out-of-Home – The Digital Out-of-Home (“DOOH”) advertising market is a subset of the overall OOH advertising market that includes in-store digital displays and interactive promotion kiosks. DOOH marketing campaigns consist of a network of digital displays that are centrally managed and target both mobile and captive customers outside the home. We are primarily focused on pursuing DOOH communication opportunities within the retail, banking, entertainment and corporate markets.
 
Enterprise Video Solutions – The Enterprise Video Solutions (“EVS”) market consists of customers seeking corporate video communications, employee training and system monitoring solutions. We are primarily focused on pursuing EVS opportunities within the government, banking, retail and corporate markets.
 
Competition
 
There are many players in the DOOH and EVS markets who have expertise in integration. Some of the key players include Diversified Media Group, Stratacache and Christie Digital.

Manufacturing

These facilities include expanded PVC welding operations with programmable automations, as well as two 90-foot high screen coating towers with state of the art precision coating application software and painting systems. This world class ISO certified operation has the capability of manufacturing multiple standard screens simultaneously to large format 2D and 3D screens for cinema and special venue applications.
Quality Control
 
We believe that our quality control procedures and the quality standards for the products that we manufacture, distribute or service have contributed significantly to our reputation for high performance and reliability. The inspection of incoming materials and components as well as the testing of all of our products during various stages of the sales and service cycle are key elements of this program.
Trademarks
 
We own or otherwise have rights to various trademarks and trade names used in conjunction with the sale of our products. We believe our success will not be dependent upon trademark protection, but rather upon our scientific and engineering capabilities and research and production techniques.

We employed 335 persons at December 31, 2017. Of these employees, 162 positions were considered manufacturing or operational, 90 were service related and 83 were considered sales and administrative. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.
