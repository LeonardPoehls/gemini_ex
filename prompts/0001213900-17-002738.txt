ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
 
We are a marine enterprises group primarily engaging in ocean fishing through our PRC operating subsidiary, Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd., or Pingtan Fishing. We harvest a variety of fish species with our owned and licensed vessels operating within the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone, Indo-Pacific waters, the Arafura Sea of Indonesia, and international waters of Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We provide high quality seafood to a diverse group of customers including distributors, restaurant owners and exporters in the PRC.
 
In June 2013, we expanded our fleet from 40 to 86 vessels through a purchase of 46 fishing trawlers from a related party for a total consideration of $410.1 million. We began operating the vessels in the third quarter of 2013 and since then we have been entitled to their operations and net profits. Each vessel carries a crew of 10 to 15 persons. These vessels have resulted in additional carrying capacity of approximately 45,000 to 50,000 tons.
 
In September 2013, we further increased our fleet to 106 vessels with the addition of 20 newly-built fishing trawlers. These vessels have a run-in period of 3 - 6 months, during which each is placed into the sea for testing prior to full operation. At full operation, each vessel is capable of harvesting 900 to 1,000 tons of fish.
 
Subsequent to our fleet expansions, in September 2013, the Ministry of Agriculture of the People’s Republic of China (“MOA”) issued a notification that it would suspend accepting shipbuilding applications for tuna harvesting vessels, squid harvesting vessels, Pacific saury harvesting vessels, trawlers operating on international waters, seine on international waters, and trawlers operating on the Arafura Sea, Indonesia. We believe the announcement is a positive indicator for long-term stability and balance in China’s fishing industry.
 
On December 4, 2013, in connection with the sale of China Dredging Group Co., Ltd (“CDGC”) to Hong Long, a related party, we acquired 25-year operating license rights in connection with the lease of 20 fishing drifters for the appraised fair market value of approximately $216.1 million, whereby we are entitled to 100% of the operations and net profits (losses) from the vessels for the term of the lease.
 
In September 2014, we further expanded our fleet to 129 vessels with the addition of 3 newly-built light luring seine vessels. At full operation, each vessel is capable of harvesting 2,000 tons of fish.
 
In June 2015, we purchased 4 longline fishing vessels and 2 squid jigging vessels for the appraised fair market value of approximately $56.2 million. These vessels are primarily focused on catching tuna and squid.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we own 91 trawlers, 15 drifters, 3 light luring seine vessels, 2 squid jigging vessels and have exclusive operating license rights to 20 drifters, and we also have 4 longline fishing vessels in final process of paperwork formalities and will be put into operation upon completion. We are the second largest China based fishery company operating its vessels outside of China waters and our fleet has an average remaining useful life of approximately 13.4 years. These vessels are fully licensed to operate in their fishing territories.
 
Among the 135 fishing vessels, 13 are operating in Indo-Pacific waters; 12 are operating in the Bay of Bengal in India; 2 are operating in international waters of Southwest Atlantic and Southeast Pacific Oceans; 4 will be operating in international waters of Pacific Ocean upon completion of paperwork formalities, and the remaining vessels are licensed to operate in the Arafura Sea in Indonesia but temporarily not operating due to the moratorium discussed below.
 
Currently we catch nearly 20 different species of fish including ribbon fish, croaker fish, pomfret, Spanish mackerel, conger eel, squid and red snapper. All of our catch is shipped back to China. Our fishing vessels transport frozen catch to cold storage warehouses at nearby onshore fishing bases. We then arrange periodic charted transportation ships to deliver frozen stocks to our nine cold storage warehouses located in one of China’s largest seafood trading centers, Mawei Seafood Market in Fujian Province.
 
We derive our revenue primarily from the sales of frozen seafood products. We sell our products directly to customers including distributors, restaurant owners and exporters. Most of our customers have long-term, cooperative relationships with us. Our existing customers also introduce new customers to us from time to time. Our operating results are subject to seasonal variations. Harvest volume is the highest in the fourth quarter of the year and harvest volumes in the second and third quarters are relatively low due to the spawning season of certain fish species, including ribbon fish, cuttlefish, butterfish, and calamari. Based on past experiences, demand for seafood products is the highest from December to January during Chinese New Year. We believe that our profitability and growth are dependent on our ability to expand our customer base.

Government Permits and Approvals
 
We are required to go through a series of procedures to obtain all approvals necessary to fish in the dedicated fishing areas.
 
Step one: Obtaining Vessel Building Permits
 
First, we have to file a vessel building application to the relevant governmental authorities in Fujian to obtain the Fishing Vessel and Net Tools Building Permits. Governmental authorities in Fujian verify Pingtan Fishing’s qualifications for pelagic fishing and pass on the verified and approved application documents to affiliates of the Ministry of Agriculture for further confirmation. Once confirmed, the certificates are issued to Pingtan Fishing.
Step two: Vessels Building and Inspection
 
After obtaining the Fishing Vessel and Net Tools Building Permits, we start building the new vessels through contracting with third party vessel manufacturers. During the period of construction, inspection of the vessels is performed several times by the relevant governmental authorities. Once the construction is completed, a Vessel Inspection Certificate is issued, after which we can apply for certificates of ownership and certificates of nationality for new vessels.
Step three: Fishing Project Application
 
After obtaining all certificates in step two, we file applications to the relevant governmental authorities to obtain approvals for pelagic fishing projects in the specified fishing areas. Meanwhile, we start the application process for obtaining fishing permits from the relevant governmental authorities in the applicable fishing destination countries.
Step four: Preparations Before Departure
 
Once the approval for pelagic fishing projects is issued, we can complete all relevant departure procedures within six months from the time the notification of approval is issued. Departure procedures include obtaining visas for fishing vessels and crew members, submitting required certificates to the PRC customs in Fujian, and obtaining other relevant documents from governmental authorities, such as Vessel Departure Certificates.
Step five: Fishing Project Approval and Departure to Fishing Areas
 
After we have submitted all required documents to the relevant governmental authorities and completed all procedures required for departure, we receive confirmation of pelagic fishing project approval from affiliates of the Ministry of Agriculture. Once we obtain such confirmation, our vessels can departure to the applicable fishing destination country. Fish caught at the destination may then be shipped back and be declared at the PRC customs.
 
In early December 2014, the Indonesian government introduced a six-month moratorium on issuing new fishing licenses and renewals so that the country’s Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (“MMAF”) could monitor the operations of existing fleets and to fight illegal fishing activities. As a result, all licensed fishing vessels operating in Indonesian waters have been informed by the Indonesian government to operate within strict guidelines in order to avoid potential enforcement actions, such as boat seizures, by the Indonesian Navy. We currently operate 135 fishing vessels and have a license to operate 104 of these vessels operate in the Arafura Sea of Indonesia. To cooperate and remain in compliance with the Indonesian government’s fishing license check procedures, in January 2015, we lowered our operation to approximately half of our normal level. From February 2015, we temporarily ceased operations in the Indonesian waters. Since we derive a majority of our revenue from this area, this temporary ban has caused a significant drop in our production. As a result, our sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased significantly as compared to that of 2015 and 2014. In November 2015, the Indonesian government announced that the moratorium had concluded. Our expectation is that the MMAF will implement new fishing policies and resume the license renewal process although this has not yet occurred. In the interim, our financial results will continue to be materially adversely affected by this moratorium.

Operations
 
Harvesting Operations
 
The fishing vessels can carry up to one-month of supplies. The captains of the vessels utilize sophisticated technology to identify, among other things, fishing areas, time to cast and draw in the nets, vessel speed and sailing direction allowing the vessels to optimize the catch and resource value. Nearby fishing groups share real-time fishing information through wireless radio equipment. The catch is separated based on species and sizes, and is frozen immediately.
 
Once the storage of a fishing vessel is at capacity, it returns to the fishing base and transfers the catch to a transportation vessels docked at the fishing base port. We have entered into a contract with Avona Mina Lestari (“Avona”), which operates a fishing base owned by Mr. Xinrong Zhuo, our founder and chairman, to obtain access to the base and secure certain services including custom declaration and fishing permits registrations. We also use the fishing base to repair our vessels, if necessary.
 
Transportation
 
Transportation vessels are responsible for the shipment of fishing supplies and fish between the fishing areas and China. Pingtan Fishing ships its goods by contracting with three affiliate marine transportation firms and Avona. The transportation cycle typically takes no more than 30 days, depending mainly on the fishing seasons.
Seasonality
 
The peak season for the fishing industry in Indonesia is from October to January, which is when harvesting is most productive. During the low season, from May to July, there are fewer fish as they migrate to different areas. There is no off season for fishing in Pingtan Fishing’s dedicated fishing zone in Indonesia.
 
In addition to seasonality, our annual catches are affected by a number of unpredictable factors, such as weather patterns and fish migration, which are likely to vary from year to year.
 
Cold Storage
 
Fish are stored separately according to different species and sizes for best practices of cold storage management, goods selectivity and delivery. When Pingtan Fishing unloads the fish, it places the fish on a wood pallet according to fishing vessel number, species and size. The cold storage administrator counts the number of bags on each pallet and weighs each pallet to record the weight. Pallets with bags of fish are then placed in specified positions within the cold storage facilities.
 
We have secured several cold storages located in one of China’s largest seafood trading center, MaWei seafood market. The monthly rent for the cold storage is RMB80 (US$12) per square meter and the leases are renewable annually. The following table sets forth information regarding the cold storages we currently rent as of December 31, 2016:
 

 | Storage Capacity | | Monthly rent | 
-------------+------------------+-------+--------------+--
Cold Storage | (sq. meters) | | (US$) | 
#201 | | 1,045 | | $ | 12,586
#203 | | 1,045 | | | 12,586
Total | | 2,090 | | $ | 25,172

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We market, sell and distribute products all over China, including the Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. Ribbon fish, croaker fish and reefcod were the main types of seafood sold for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing 85.4% of the sales.
 
We have established long-term relationships with a number of customers, who send purchasing representatives to our cold storage facilities to select goods to purchase. The customer indicates the type, size and quantity as well as price and delivery schedules before the fish is moved into our cold storage facilities. Handling and transportation fees are borne by the customer when the goods are delivered. The proportion of these sales depends on the season and the nature of the catch including species, size and quality. Remaining products are sold out of cold storage within three months of landing.

As of December 31, 2016, we sold our fish to over 120 distributors and retailers by acting as a wholesaler. We serve a wide customer base and no customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Vessels
 
As of December 31, 2016, we own 91 trawlers, 15 drifters, 3 light luring seine vessels, 2 squid jigging vessels and have exclusive operating license rights to 20 drifters, and we also have 4 longline fishing vessels in the final process of paperwork formalities and will be put into operation upon completion. We are the second largest China based fishery company operating its vessels outside of China waters and our fleet has an average remaining useful life of approximately 13.4 years. All these vessels are fully licensed to operate in their fishing territories.
 
Among the 135 fishing vessels, 13 are operating in Indo-Pacific waters; 12 are operating in the Bay of Bengal in India; 2 are operating in international waters of Southwest Atlantic and Southeast Pacific Oceans; 4 are in the final process of paperwork formalities and will be operating in international waters of Pacific Ocean upon completion, and the remaining vessels are licensed to operate in the Arafura Sea in Indonesia but temporarily not operating due to the moratorium discussed below.
 
Single trawling vessels drag pocket-shaped nets and therefore force the fish into the nets. The trawl net on a trawling vessel is drawn by a winch on the deck of the vessel. Fish are sorted and stored in the cold storage on board the vessel. Single trawling vessels can catch species living in the upper layer of water. It has the advantage of catching multiple species of fish, which leads to a varied catch. Single trawling vessels are the majority of fishing vessels we currently use. As of December 31, 2016, we own 91 trawling vessels. 12 of the trawling vessels are currently operating in Indian waters.
 
Drifter vessels, as known as drifter netter vessels, have a gill net that is tied to the drift netter floats with weights attached to the net to keep it vertical, so that fish crossing the path of a drift net gets caught in it. Operations are generally carried out at night and the position of gill nets can be adjusted according to the water depth in which the fish move at any time. Drifter netter vessels are mainly used to catch dispersed fish or fish swimming in the upper layer of water. We own 15 drifters and had operating license rights to 20 drifters as of December 31, 2016. 13 of the drifter vessels are currently operating in Indo-Pacific waters.
 
Business Strategy
 
We are committed to developing our business to become a global, integrated seafood company. We plan to enlarge our fishing fleet in the next few years through organic growth and acquisition opportunities of potential targets, domestically and abroad.
 
We are actively seeking opportunities to expand to other fishing grounds worldwide including North America, South America and the High Sea, which will further diversify the fish types we harvest as well as decrease our dependence on Indonesia. We are also planning to extend to fish processing business. If we operate fish processing plants, our goal is to market processed food products throughout China and in international markets while achieving forward integration of the industrial chain.
 
Competition
 
We engage in the fishing business in the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone, Indo-Pacific waters, the Arafura Sea of Indonesia and international waters of Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We believe that competition within our dedicated fishing areas is not significant, as we believe the region is not currently overfished.
 
Competition in the consumer market in China is high as fish compete with other sources of protein. We compete with other fishing companies which offer similar and varied products. There is significant demand for fish in the Chinese market. Our catch appeals to a wide segment of consumers because of the low price points of our products. We have generally been able to sell our catch at market prices.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 373 employees. The following table sets forth the number of employees by function as of December 31, 2016:
 

 | Number of Employees | | % of Total
------------------------------------+---------------------+-----+-----------
Management and administrative staff | | 64 | | 17.2 | %
Crew members | | 309 | | 82.8 | %
Total | | 373 | | 100.0 | %

We also use local Indonesian contract labor to supplement the Chinese crew, which varies based on seasons. In addition, we engage Avona as our agent to contract with third party labor companies to hire local crew members and we pay the hiring costs based on the actual fees incurred. Our company and Avona settle this payment on a quarterly basis. Welfare and benefit payments for such personnel are covered by the company supplying the crew members.
 
Company History
 
China Equity Growth Investment Ltd. (“CGEI”) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted limited liability company, was incorporated as a blank check company on January 18, 2010 with the purpose of directly or indirectly acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination, an operating business, or control of such operating business through contractual arrangements, that has its principal business and/or material operations located in the PRC. In connection with its initial business combination, CGEI changed its name to Pingtan Marine Enterprise Ltd. in February 2013.
 
China Dredging Group Co., Ltd (“CDGC” or “China Dredging”) and Merchant Supreme Co., Ltd (“Merchant Supreme”) are limited liability companies incorporated on April 14, 2010 and June 25, 2012, respectively, in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”).
 
China Dredging, through its PRC Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”), Fujian Xinggang Port Service Co., Ltd (“Fujian Service”), provided specialized dredging services exclusively to the PRC marine infrastructure market and is, based on the number and capacity of the dredging vessels it operates, one of the leading independent (not state-owned) providers of such services in the PRC. Since its inception, China Dredging has functioned exclusively as a specialist subcontractor, performing dredging services for other companies licensed to function as general contractors. China Dredging engages in capital dredging (dredging carried out to create a new harbor, berth or waterway or to deepen existing facilities in order to allow larger ships access), maintenance dredging and reclamation dredging projects and primarily sources its projects by subcontracting projects from general contractors.
 
Merchant Supreme, through its PRC VIE, Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd. (“Pingtan Fishing”) engages in ocean fishery with its fleet of self- owned vessels and vessels with exclusive operating license rights within Indian EEZ and Arafura Sea of Indonesia. Pingtan Fishing is ranked highly as one of the leading private (not state-owned) supplier and trader of oceanic aquatic products in PRC.
 
CGEI and CDGC entered into the Merger Agreement dated October 24, 2012, providing for the combination of CGEI and CDGC. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CDGC would continue as the surviving company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGEI. CGEI also acquired all of the outstanding capital shares and other equity interests of Merchant Supreme as per Share Purchase Agreement dated October 24, 2012. Following the completion of the business combination on February 25, 2013, CDGC and Merchant Supreme became the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “Business Combination”). The ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share were listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “PME”. The merger among CGEI, CDGC and Merchant Supreme has been accounted for as a “reverse merger”. CDGC and Merchant Supreme jointly are deemed the accounting acquirer and consequently, the transaction is treated as recapitalization of CDGC and Merchant Supreme.
 
On June 19, 2013, the Company entered into a master agreement (“Master Agreement”) with a related party, Fuzhou Honglong Ocean Fishery Co., Ltd (“Hong Long”) to acquire 46 fishing vessels with total consideration of $410.1 million. The major shareholder of Hong Long is Ms. Ping Lin, spouse of Xinrong Zhuo, the Company’s Chairman and CEO, who holds 66.5% of Hong Long. Mr. Zhuo currently holds about 56.2% of PME. On September 1, 2013, the Company further entered into a Memorandum with Hong Long to clarify the procedure of delivery of such 46 vessels to Pingtan Fishing. Due to additional time required prepare the vessels for operations, the parties agreed under the Memorandum to deliver the vessels for operation on September 1, 2013. Since June 2013, the Company has had full ownership of the vessels and the full right to operate the vessels and is in the process of registering the vessels under the name of the Company’s PRC operating company. Currently, 20 of the 46 vessels are formally registered to the Company. The vessels are in the process of being registered under the name of the Company’s PRC operating company and it will obtain the entire title registration document for the vessels, as required by Chinese laws and regulations according to the terms of the Master Agreement.
 
In order to place increased focus on fishing business and pursue more effective growth opportunities, we decided to exit and sell the specialized dredging services operated by China Dredging, and we completed the sale of CDGC and its subsidiaries on December 4, 2013.
