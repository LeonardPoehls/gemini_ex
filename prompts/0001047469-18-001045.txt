Item 1.    Business
NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
   General
 We are a publicly traded Delaware master limited partnership. Our common units trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol TCP. We were formed by TransCanada Corporation and its subsidiaries (TransCanada) in 1998 to acquire, own and participate in the management of energy infrastructure businesses in North America. Our pipeline systems transport natural gas in the U.S. 
 We are managed by our General Partner, which is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of TransCanada. At December 31, 2017, subsidiaries of TransCanada own approximately 24.2 percent of our common units, 100 percent of our Class B units, 100 percent of our incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and an effective two percent general partner interest in us. See Part II, Item 5. "Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" for more information regarding TransCanada's ownership in us. 
   Recent Business Developments

 On January 23, 2018, the board of directors of our General Partner declared the Partnership's fourth quarter 2017 cash distribution in the amount of $1.00 per common unit payable on February 13, 2018 to unitholders of record as of February 2, 2018. This declared distribution to our General Partner included a $2 million distribution for its effective two percent general partner interest and an IDR payment of $3 million for a total distribution of $5 million. 
 Incentive distributions are paid to our General Partner if quarterly cash distributions on the common units exceed levels specified in the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (as amended, the Partnership Agreement). The Partnership paid a total of $10 million in respect of the IDRs to our General Partner on the distributions declared from the first to the fourth quarter of 2017. See Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Cash Distribution Policy of the Partnership" for further information regarding the Partnership's distributions. 
 Pipeline updates
Great Lakes Contracting and Settlement  On April 24, 2017, Great Lakes reached an agreement on the terms of a new long-term transportation capacity contract with its affiliate, TransCanada. The contract, which was subject to Canada's National Energy Board (NEB) approval, is for a term of 10 years and allows TransCanada the ability to transport up to 0.711 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day on the Great Lakes system from the Manitoba/U.S. border to the U.S. border near Dawn Ontario. On September 21, 2017, TransCanada received approval from the NEB and as a result, the contract commenced on November 1, 2017. The contract contains volume reduction options up to full contract quantity beginning in year three. 
 During the latter half of 2017 and the early part of 2018, Great Lakes sold all of its available 2017-2018 firm winter capacity. This level of contracting is significantly higher than that seen on this pipeline in recent years, and indicates a favorable shift in market dynamics for this asset. 
 On October 30, 2017, Great Lakes filed a rate settlement with FERC to satisfy its obligations from its 2013 rate settlement for new rates to be in effect by January 1, 2018 (2017 Great Lakes Settlement). The 2017 Great Lakes Settlement, which was approved by FERC on February 22, 2018, decreased Great Lakes' maximum transportation rates by 27 percent effective October 1, 2017. Great Lakes expects that, notwithstanding the decrease in rates, the impact from other changes, including: the recent long-term transportation contract with TransCanada as described above, other revenue opportunities on the system and the elimination of the revenue sharing mechanism with its customers, will more than offset the full year impact of the reduction in Great Lakes' rates beginning in 2018. The 2017 Great Lakes Settlement does not contain a moratorium provision and Great Lakes will be required to file for new rates no later than March 31, 2022, with new rates to be effective October 1, 2022. 
 Northern Border Contracting  Northern Border revenues are substantially supported by firm transportation contracts through the end of 2020. The continued successful renewals of these contracts provide a strong indication of Northern Border's competitive position. 
 GTN Incremental Contracting  GTN had successful open seasons during late 2017 and the early part of 2018 generally in line with increasing available upstream capacity following the debottlenecking activities on TransCanada's pipelines. As a result, GTN has sold all its available firm capacity beginning mid-2020. GTN continues to provide a key 
 8    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2017

   transportation service delivering natural gas out of Western Canada to downstream markets in the Pacific Northwest and California. 
 Continent to Coast (C2C) Project  In the fourth quarter of 2017, PNGTS filed to increase its FERC-certificated capacity to accommodate the period during which the approximately 82,000 Dth/day of long-term contracts (C2C contracts) overlap with certain of its original contracts which mature in 2019. On November 28, 2017, PNGTS received the approval from FERC to increase its capacity up to approximately 210,000 Dth/day effective December 1, 2017. The C2C contracts were effective December 1, 2017 and they mature in 2032. 
 Portland XPress Project  PNGTS has executed precedent agreements (PAs) with several local distribution companies (LDCs) in New England and Atlantic Canada (PXP contracts) to re-contract certain system capacity set to expire in 2019 as well as construct incremental compression facilities within PNGTS' existing footprint in Maine (Portland Xpress Project or "PXP"). The PXP contracts, together with the C2C contracts, will provide transportation service of natural gas in the New England area of up to 0.3 Bcf/d by November 1, 2020, effectively utilizing all of PNGTS' expanded capacity through 2032. The in-service dates of PXP will be phased-in over a three-year period beginning November 1, 2018. 
 PNGTS expects the capital cost of PXP to be approximately $80 million, which PNGTS expects to finance through a new credit facility. Concurrently with PXP, TransCanada will perform upstream capacity expansions of approximately $107 million (TransCanada PXP Expenditures), the majority of which is expected to be incurred following the anticipated receipt dates of required regulatory approvals. In connection with the TransCanada expansions, PNGTS signed a precedent agreement with TransCanada that contemplates the execution of a firm transportation agreement for each of the three phases of PXP, which will be assigned to the LDCs at the completion of each phase. Prior to assignment of the TransCanada transportation agreements to its customers, PNGTS is obligated for the TransCanada PXP Expenditures in the event PXP does not proceed as anticipated. 
 Northern Border Settlement  Northern Border's 2013 settlement agreement required Northern Border to file for new rates no later than January 1, 2018. On December 4, 2017, Northern Border filed a rate settlement with FERC which precluded the need to file a general rate case by January 1, 2018 (2017 Northern Border Settlement). The 2017 Northern Border Settlement, which was approved by FERC on February 23, 2018, provides for tiered rate reductions effective January 1, 2018, with no change to the underlying rate design. The 2017 Northern Border Settlement does not contain any moratorium and unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement, recourse rates in effect at December 31, 2017, will decrease by 5.0% on January 1, 2018; by an additional 5.5% on April 1, 2018; and by a further 2.0% beginning January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2023, when Northern Border will be required to establish new rates. This equates to an overall rate reduction of 12.5% by January 1, 2020 from the recourse rates in effect at December 31, 2017. 
 Acquisitions and Financing
Debt Offering  On May 25, 2017, the Partnership closed a $500 million public offering of senior unsecured notes bearing an interest rate of 3.90 percent maturing May 25, 2027. The net proceeds of $497 million were used to fund a portion of the 2017 Acquisition. 
 2017 Acquisition  On June 1, 2017, the Partnership completed the acquisition of a 49.34 percent interest in Iroquois from subsidiaries of TransCanada and an option to acquire a further 0.66 percent interest in Iroquois, together with an additional 11.81 percent interest in PNGTS that results in the Partnership owning a 61.71 percent interest in PNGTS. The total purchase price of the 2017 Acquisition was $765 million plus final purchase price adjustments amounting to approximately $50 million. The purchase price consisted of: (i) $710 million for the Iroquois interest (less $164 million, which reflected the Partnership's 49.34 percent share of Iroquois' outstanding debt at the time of the 2017 Acquisition); (ii) $55 million for the additional 11.81 percent interest in PNGTS (less $5 million, which reflected our 11.81 percent share in PNGTS' outstanding debt at the time of the 2017 Acquisition); (iii) final working capital adjustments for Iroquois and PNGTS amounting to $19 million and $3 million, respectively; and (iv) additional consideration of $28 million for the surplus cash (discussed below) on Iroquois' balance sheet. The Partnership funded the cash portion 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2017    9

   of the 2017 Acquisition through a combination of proceeds from the May 25, 2017 public debt offering and borrowing under its Senior Credit Facility. 
 As of the date of the 2017 Acquisition, there was significant cash on Iroquois' balance sheet. Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement associated with the acquisition of the Iroquois interest, as amended, the Partnership agreed to pay $28 million plus interest to TransCanada on August 1, 2017 for its 49.34 percent share of the cash determined to be surplus to Iroquois' operating needs. 
 Iroquois' partners adopted a distribution resolution to address the surplus cash on Iroquois' balance sheet post-closing. The Partnership expects to receive the $28 million of unrestricted cash as part of its quarterly distributions from Iroquois over 11 quarters under the terms of the resolution, which began with Iroquois' second quarter 2017 distribution on August 1, 2017. As of February 26, 2018 the Partnership has received approximately $7.8 million of the expected $28 million, of which $5.2 million was received in 2017 and $2.6 million was received on February 1, 2018. 
 Tuscarora Refinancing  On August 21, 2017, Tuscarora refinanced all of its outstanding debt by amending its existing Unsecured Term Loan Facility and issuing a new $25 million variable rate term loan that will require yearly principal payments beginning September 1, 2018 and will mature on August 21, 2020. Tuscarora's Unsecured Term Loan contains a covenant that requires Tuscarora to maintain a debt service coverage ratio (cash available from operations divided by the sum of interest expense and principal payments) of greater than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2017, the ratio was 11.09 to 1.00. 
 2013 Term Loan Facility  On September 29, 2017, the Partnership's variable rate $500 million Term loan facility that was due on July 1, 2018 was amended to extend the maturity period through October 2, 2022. As a result of this extension, the Partnership implemented an interest rate hedging strategy during the fourth quarter and hedged the entire $500 million until its October 2, 2022 maturity using forward starting swaps at an average rate of 3.26 percent. At December 31, 2017, the 2013 $500 million Term loan facility was hedged by fixed interest rate swap arrangements at an effective interest rate of 2.31 percent, expiring July 1, 2018. 
 2015 Term Loan Facility  On September 29, 2017, the Partnership's $170 million Term loan facility that was due on October 1, 2018 was amended to extend the maturity period through October 1, 2020. 
 2017 US Tax Reform  On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law H.R. 1 (the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" or the "2017 Tax Act"). The 2017 Tax Act resulted in major changes to U.S. tax law, including a decrease in the U.S. corporate federal tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. Although we are not a federally taxable entity, we expect the lower tax rates to impact future rate-setting processes on our pipeline systems due to the FERC-regulated nature of our business. The FERC approves our pipelines' rates on a cost-of-service basis which includes a recovery of our ultimate taxable owners' income tax expense as a component of the rates charged to customers. Over time, we expect these changes will impact our future performance through changes in the cash flows generated by our subsidiaries and distributions from our equity investments.

   
Our goal is to maximize distributable cash flows over the long-term through efficient utilization of our pipeline systems and appropriate business strategies, while maintaining a commitment to safe and reliable operations. 

   Understanding the Natural Gas Pipeline Business
 Natural gas pipelines move natural gas from major sources of supply or upstream pipelines to downstream pipelines or locations or markets that use natural gas to meet their energy needs. Pipeline systems include meter stations that record how much natural gas comes on to the pipeline and how much exits at the delivery locations; compressor stations that act like pumps to move the large volumes of natural gas along the pipeline; and the pipelines themselves that transport natural gas under high pressure. 
 Regulation, rates and cost recovery 
 Interstate natural gas pipelines are regulated by FERC. FERC approves the construction of new pipeline facilities and regulates aspects of our business including the maximum rates that are allowed to be charged. Maximum rates are based on operating costs, which include allowances for operating and maintenance costs, income and property taxes, interest on debt, depreciation expense to recover invested capital and a return on the capital invested. Although FERC regulates maximum rates for services, interstate natural gas pipelines frequently face competition and therefore may choose to discount their services in order to compete. 
 Because FERC rate reviews are periodic and not annual, actual revenues and costs typically vary from those projected during a rate case. If revenues no longer provide a reasonable opportunity to recover costs, a pipeline can file with FERC for a determination of new rates, subject to any moratoriums in effect. FERC also has the authority to initiate a review to determine whether a pipeline's rates of return are just and reasonable. Sometimes a settlement or agreement with the pipeline shippers is achieved, precluding the need for FERC to conduct a rate case, which may include mutually beneficial performance incentives. A settlement is ultimately subject to FERC approval. 
 Contracting 
 New pipeline projects are typically supported by long-term contracts. The term of the contracts is dependent on the individual developer's appetite for risk and is a function of expected rates of return, stability and certainty of returns. Transportation contracts expire at varying times and underpin varying amounts of capacity. As existing contracts approach their expiration dates, efforts are made to extend and/or renew the contracts. If market conditions are not favorable at the time of renewal, transportation capacity may remain uncontracted, be contracted at lower rates or be contracted on a shorter-term basis. Unsold capacity may be recontracted if and when market conditions become more favorable. The ability to extend and/or renew expiring contracts and the terms of such subsequent contracts will depend upon the overall commercial environment for natural gas transportation and consumption, in the region in which the pipeline is situated. 
 Business environment 
 The North American natural gas pipeline network has been developed to connect supply to market. Use and growth of this infrastructure is affected by changes in the location, relative cost of natural gas supply and changing market demand. 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2017    11

  The map below shows the location of certain North American basins in relation to our pipeline systems together with those of our General Partner, TransCanada Corporation. 
 
Supply 
 Natural gas is primarily transported from producing regions and, in limited circumstances, from liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facilities to market hubs or interconnects for distribution to natural gas consumers. The ongoing development of shale and other unconventional gas reserves has resulted in increases in overall North American natural gas production and economically recoverable reserves. 
 There has been an increase in production from the development of shale gas reserves that are located close to traditional markets, particularly in the Northeastern U.S. This has increased the number of supply choices for natural gas consumers resulting in changes to historical natural gas pipeline flow patterns. 
 The supply of natural gas in North America is expected to continue increasing significantly over the next decade and over the long-term for a number of reasons, including the following: 
  
use of technology, including horizontal drilling in combination with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, is allowing companies to access unconventional resources economically. This is increasing the technically accessible resource base of existing and emerging gas basins; and 

application of these technologies to existing oil fields where further recovery of the existing resource is now possible. There is often associated gas discovered in the exploration and production of liquids-rich hydrocarbons (for example the Bakken oil fields), which also contributes to an increase in the overall gas supply for North America. 

 12    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2017

  Other factors that can influence the overall level of natural gas supply in North America include: 
  
the price of natural gas  low prices in North America may increase demand but reduce drilling activities that in turn diminish production levels, particularly in dry natural gas fields where the extra revenue generated from the associated liquids is not available. High natural gas prices may encourage higher drilling activities but may decrease the level of demand; 

producer portfolio diversification  large producers often diversify their portfolios by developing several basins but this is influenced by actual costs to develop the resource as well as economic access to markets and cost of pipeline transportation services. Basin-on-basin competition impacts the extent and timing of a resource development that, in turn, drives changing dynamics for pipeline capacity demand; and 

regulatory and public scrutiny  changes in regulations that apply to natural gas production and consumption could impact the cost and pace of development of natural gas in North America. 

 Demand 
 The natural gas pipeline business ultimately depends on a shipper's demand for pipeline capacity and the price paid for that capacity. Demand for pipeline capacity is influenced by, among other things, supply and market competition, economic activity, weather conditions, natural gas pipeline and storage competition and the price of alternative fuels. 
 The growing supply of natural gas has resulted in relatively low natural gas prices in North America which has supported increased demand for natural gas particularly in the following areas: 
  
natural gas-fired power generation; 

petrochemical and industrial facilities; 

the production of Alberta's oil sands, although new greenfield projects that have not begun construction may be delayed in the current oil price environment; 

exports to Mexico to fuel electric power generation facilities; and 

exports from North America to global markets through a number of proposed LNG export facilities. 

 Commodity Prices 
 In general, the profitability of the natural gas pipelines business is not directly tied to commodity prices given we are a transporter of the commodity and the transportation costs are not tied to the price of natural gas. However, the cyclical supply and demand nature of commodities and its price impact can have a secondary impact on our business where our shippers may choose to accelerate or delay certain projects. This can impact the timing for the demand of transportation services and/or new gas pipeline infrastructure. 
Competition 
 Competition among natural gas pipelines is based primarily on transportation rates and proximity to natural gas supply areas and consuming markets. Changes in supply locations and regional demand have resulted in changes to pipeline flow dynamics. Where pipelines historically transported natural gas from one or two supply sources to their markets under long-term contracts, today many pipelines transport gas in multiple directions and under shorter contract terms. Some pipelines have even reversed their flows in order to adapt to changing sources of supply. Competition among pipelines to attract supply and new or existing markets to their systems has also increased across North America. 
Our Pipeline Systems
 We have ownership interests in eight natural gas interstate pipeline systems that are collectively designed to transport approximately 10.4 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from producing regions and import facilities to market hubs and consuming markets primarily in the Western, Midwestern and Eastern U.S. All of our pipeline systems, except Iroquois and the PNGTS joint facilities, are operated by subsidiaries of TransCanada. The Iroquois pipeline system is operated by Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Iroquois. The PNGTS Joint Facilities (see below) are operated by MNOC, a subsidiary of MNE. MNE is a subsidiary of Enbridge Inc.

  The map below shows the location of our pipeline systems. 
 
Customers, Contracting and Demand 
 Our customers are generally large utilities, LDCs, major natural gas marketers, producing companies and other interstate pipelines, including affiliates. Our pipelines generate revenue by charging rates for transporting natural gas. Natural gas transportation service is provided pursuant to long-term and short-term contracts on a firm or interruptible basis. The majority of our pipeline systems' natural gas transportation services are provided through firm service transportation contracts with a reservation or demand charge that reserves pipeline capacity, regardless of use, for the term of the contract. The revenues associated with capacity reserved under firm service transportation contracts are not subject to fluctuations caused by changing supply and demand conditions, competition or customers. Customers with interruptible service transportation agreements may utilize available capacity after firm service transportation requests are satisfied. 
 Our pipeline systems actively market their available capacity and work closely with customers, including natural gas producers, LDCs, marketers and end users, to ensure our pipelines are offering attractive services and competitive rates. Approximately 74 percent of our long-term contract revenues are with customers who have an investment grade rating or who have provided guarantees from investment grade parties. We have obtained financial assurances as permitted by FERC and our tariffs for the remaining long-term contracts. See Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors." 
 One of our customers, Anadarko Energy Services Company accounted for a significant portion of our revenue and comprised 11 percent of the Partnership's revenues in 2017. 
 GTN  GTN's revenues are substantially supported by long-term contracts through the end of 2023 with its remaining contracts extending between 2024 and 2045. These contracts, which have historically been renewed on a long-term 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2017    15

   basis upon expiration, are primarily held by LDCs that use a diversified portfolio of transportation options to serve their long-term markets and marketers contracting under a variety of contract terms. We expect GTN to continue to be an important transportation component of these diversified portfolios. Incremental transportation opportunities are based on the difference in value between Western Canadian natural gas supplies and deliveries to Northern California. 
 Currently, GTN is benefitting from an increase in the volumes of natural gas it transports as debottlenecking activities occur on upstream pipeline systems which deliver natural gas to GTN. These upstream activities are continuing and as a result, we are in the process of signing over 700,000 Dth/day in long-term contracts of which 348,000 Dth/day will result in additional volumes flowing onto GTN as early as mid-2018 with the remainder from 2019 to 2020. The majority of these contracts have terms of at least 15 years. 
 Northern Border  Northern Border is a highly competitive pipeline system and is fully contracted with its revenues substantially supported by firm transportation contracts through the end of 2020. Northern Border's contracts include renewal rights and expiring contracts have typically been renewed for terms of five years. In addition, Northern Border sells seasonal transportation services which have traditionally been strongest during peak winter months to serve heating demand and peak spring/summer months to serve electric cooling demand and storage injection. 
 Great Lakes  Great Lakes' revenue is derived from both short-haul and long-haul transportation services. The majority of its contracts are with TransCanada and affiliates on multiple paths across its system. Great Lakes' ability to sell its available and future capacity will depend on future market conditions which are impacted by a number of factors including weather, levels of natural gas in storage, the capacity of upstream and downstream pipelines and the availability and pricing of natural gas supplies. Demand for Great Lakes' services has historically been highest in the summer to fill the natural gas storage complexes in Ontario and Michigan in advance of the upcoming winter season. During the winter, Great Lakes serves peak heating requirements for customers in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and the upper Midwest of the U.S. During the latter half of 2017 and the early part of 2018, Great Lakes sold all of its available 2017-2018 firm winter capacity. This level of contracting is significantly higher than that seen on this pipeline in recent years, indicative of a favorable shift in market dynamics for Great Lakes. 
 During 2017, Great Lakes benefited from TransCanada's new long-term fixed price service on its Canadian Mainline. Concurrent with the launch of this new service, Great Lakes entered into a long-term transportation agreement with TransCanada's Canadian Mainline for 0.711 billion of cubic feet that commenced on November 1, 2017 for a ten-year period and contains volume reduction options up to full contract quantity beginning in year three. This provides long-term capacity to TransCanada's shippers for the transportation of WCSB natural gas to markets in Eastern Canada and the U.S. 
 PNGTS  PNGTS' revenues are primarily generated from transportation agreements with LDCs throughout New England. The majority of PNGTS' current revenue stream is supported by long-term contracts. Long-term contract commitments of approximately 82,000 Dth/day from the C2C open season began December 1, 2017, necessitating an increase in PNGTS' certificated capacity up to approximately 210,000 Dth/day. The C2C contracts mature in 2032 and replaced some expiring short-term and long-term contracts. 
 In addition to the C2C contracts, in 2017, PNGTS executed 20-year PAs with several LDCs in New England and Atlantic Canada to re-contract certain system capacity set to expire in 2019 as well as expand the PNGTS system to bring its certificated capacity up to approximately 0.3 Bcf/day by November 1, 2020, effectively utilizing all of PNGTS' expanded capacity through 2032. 
 PXP will proceed concurrently with upstream capacity expansions on the Trans Quebec & Maritimes Pipeline (TQM) and TransCanada's Canadian Mainline systems. The in-service dates of PXP are being phased-in over a three-year period beginning November 1, 2018. PXP, together with the C2C expansion brings additional, natural gas supply options to markets in New England and Atlantic Canada in response to the growing need for natural gas transportation capacity in the region.

  Iroquois  Iroquois transports natural gas under long-term contracts that expire between 2018 and 2026 and extends from TransCanada's Canadian Mainline system at the U.S. border near Waddington, New York to markets in the U.S. northeast, including New York City, Long Island and Connecticut. Iroquois provides service to local gas distribution companies, electric utilities and electric power generators, as well as marketers and other end users, directly or indirectly, through interconnecting pipelines and exchanges throughout the northeastern U.S. Iroquois also earns discretionary transportation service revenues which can have a significant earnings impact. Discretionary transportation service revenues include short-term firm transportation service contracts with less than one-year terms as well as standard interruptible transportation service contracts. In 2017, Iroquois earned approximately 11 percent of its revenues from discretionary services. 
 Bison  Natural gas is currently not flowing in response to the recent relative cost advantage of WCSB- and Bakken -sourced gas versus Rockies production. Bison has not experienced a decrease in its revenue as it is fully contracted on a ship-or-pay basis through January of 2021. 
 Other Pipelines  North Baja and Tuscarora revenues are substantially supported by long-term contracts through 2020 and beyond. 
 Competition 
 Overall, our pipeline systems generate a substantial portion of their cash flow from long-term firm contracts for transportation services and are therefore insulated from competitive factors during the terms of the contracts. If these long-term contracts are not renewed at their expiration, our pipeline systems face competitive pressures which influence contract renewals and rates charged for transportation services. 
 GTN and Northern Border, through their respective connections with TransCanada's Foothill systems, and Great Lakes and Iroquois, through their respective connections with TransCanada's Canadian Mainline, compete with each other for WCSB natural gas supply as well as with other pipelines, including the Alliance pipeline and the Westcoast pipeline. Northern Border and Great Lakes compete in their respective market areas for natural gas supplies from other basins as well, such as the Rocky Mountain area, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, Utica and Marcellus basins. GTN primarily competes with pipelines supplying natural gas into California and Pacific Northwest markets. 
 Bison competes for deliveries with other pipelines that transport natural gas supplies within and away from the Rocky Mountain area. 
 North Baja's southbound pipeline capacity competes with deliveries of LNG received at the Costa Azul terminal in Mexico. When LNG shipments are received at Costa Azul, North Baja's northbound capacity competes with pipelines that deliver Rocky Mountain area, Permian and San Juan basin natural gas into the Southern California area. 
 Tuscarora competes for deliveries primarily into the northern Nevada natural gas market with natural gas from the Rocky Mountain area. 
 PNGTS connects with TQM at the Canadian border and shares facilities with the MNE from Westbrook, Maine to a connection with the Tennessee Gas Pipeline System near Boston, Massachusetts. PNGTS competes with LNG supplies and gas flows from Canada and with LNG delivered into Boston. Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Algonquin Gas Transmission also compete with PNGTS for gas deliveries into New England markets. 
 As noted above, Iroquois, through its connection with TransCanada's Canadian Mainline System, competes for WCSB natural gas supply with other pipelines. Iroquois connects at five locations with three interstate pipelines (Tennessee Gas, CNG Gas Transmission and Algonquin Gas Transmission) and TransCanada's Canadian Mainline System near Waddington, New York and provides a link between WCSB natural gas deliveries to markets in the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. 
 Additionally, our pipeline assets face competition from other pipeline companies seeking opportunities to invest in greenfield natural gas pipeline development opportunities. This competition could result in fewer projects being 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2017    17

   available that meet our pipeline systems' investment hurdles or projects that proceed with lower overall financial returns. 
   Relationship with TransCanada
 TransCanada is the indirect parent of our General Partner and at December 31, 2017, owns, through its subsidiaries, approximately 24.2 percent of our common units, 100 percent of our Class B units, 100 percent of our IDRs and an effective two percent general partner interest in us. TransCanada is a major energy infrastructure company, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and NYSE, with more than 65 years of experience in the responsible development and reliable operation of energy infrastructure in North America. TransCanada's business is primarily focused on natural gas and oil transmission and power generation services. TransCanada consists of investments in 57,100 miles natural gas pipelines, 3,000 miles of wholly-owned oil pipelines and 653 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity. TransCanada also owns or has interests in over 6,100 megawatts of power generation. 
 TransCanada operates most of our pipeline systems and in some cases, contracts for pipeline capacity. We have purchased assets from TransCanada and jointly participated with TransCanada in acquiring assets from third parties, including acquisitions that we would have been unable to pursue on our own. TransCanada views the Partnership as a core element of its strategy and considers the dropdown of assets into the Partnership as an effective financing option as it executes its capital growth program, subject to actual funding needs and market conditions. There can be no assurance as to when and on what terms these assets will be offered to the Partnership. See Part III, Item 13. "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence" for more information on our relationship with TransCanada. 
   Government Regulation
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
 All of our pipeline systems are regulated by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and Energy Policy Act of 2005, which gives FERC jurisdiction to regulate virtually all aspects of our business, including: 
  
transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce; 

rates and charges; 

terms of service and service contracts with customers, including counterparty credit support requirements; 

certification and construction of new facilities; 

extension or abandonment of service and facilities; 

accounts and records; 

depreciation and amortization policies; 

acquisition and disposition of facilities; 

initiation and discontinuation of services; and 

standards of conduct for business relations with certain affiliates. 

 Our pipeline systems' operating revenues are determined based on rate options stated in our tariffs which are approved by FERC. Tariffs specify the general terms and conditions for pipeline transportation service including the rates that may be charged. FERC, either through hearing a rate case or as a result of approving a negotiated settlement, approves the maximum rates permissible for transportation service on a pipeline system which are designed to recover the pipeline's cost-based investment, operating expenses and a reasonable return for its investors. Once maximum rates are set, a pipeline system is not permitted to adjust the maximum rates to reflect changes in costs or contract demand until new rates are approved by FERC. Pipelines are permitted to charge rates lower than the maximum tariff rates in order to 
 18    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2017

   compete. As a result, earnings and cash flows of each pipeline system depend on a number of factors including costs incurred, contracted capacity and transportation path, the volume of natural gas transported and rates charged. 
 Regulatory and Rate Proceedings 
 GTN  GTN operates under rates established pursuant to a settlement approved by FERC in June 2015. Effective July 1, 2015, the rates were reduced by three percent. In January 2016, GTN's rates decreased by a further 10 percent and will continue in effect through December 31, 2019. Unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement, GTN's rates will decrease an additional eight percent for the period January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 when GTN will be required to establish new rates. 
 Great Lakes  On October 30, 2017, Great Lakes filed a rate settlement with FERC to satisfy its obligations from its 2013 rate settlement for new rates to be in effect by January 1, 2018. The 2017 Great Lakes Settlement, which was approved by FERC on February 22, 2018, decreased Great Lakes' maximum transportation rates by 27 percent effective October 1, 2017. The 2017 Great Lakes Settlement does not contain any moratorium and Great Lakes will be required to file for new rates no later than March 31, 2022, with new rates to be effective October 1, 2022. 
 Northern Border  Northern Border's 2013 settlement agreement required Northern Border to file for new rates no later than January 1, 2018. On December 4, 2017, Northern Border filed a rate settlement with FERC precluding the need to file a general rate case by January 1, 2018 (2017 Northern Border Settlement). The 2017 Northern Border Settlement, which was approved by FERC on February 23, 2018, provides for tiered rate reductions beginning January 1, 2018, with no change to the underlying rate design. The 2017 Northern Border Settlement does not contain a moratorium provision and unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement, recourse rates in effect at December 31, 2017, will decrease by 5.0% on January 1, 2018; by an additional 5.5% on April 1, 2018; and by an additional 2.0% beginning January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2023, when Northern Border will be required to establish new rates. This equates to an overall rate reduction of 12.5% by January 1, 2020 from the recourse rates in effect at December 31, 2017. 
 Bison  Bison continues to operate under the rates approved by FERC in connection with Bison's initial construction and has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding. 
 North Baja  North Baja continues to operate under the rates approved by FERC and has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding. On January 6, 2017, North Baja notified FERC that current market conditions do not support the replacement of the compression that was temporarily abandoned in 2013 and requested authorization to permanently abandon two compressor units and a nominal volume of unsubscribed firm capacity. FERC approved the permanent abandonment request on February 16, 2017. The requested abandonments will not have any impact on existing firm transportation service. 
 Tuscarora  Tuscarora operates under rates established pursuant to a settlement approved by FERC in September 2016. Under the settlement, Tuscarora's system-wide unit rate initially decreased by 17 percent, effective August 1, 2016. Unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement, this rate will remain in effect until July 31, 2019, after which time the unit rate will decrease by an additional seven percent from August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2022. The settlement does not contain a rate moratorium provision and requires Tuscarora to file to establish new rates no later than August 1, 2022. 
 PNGTS  PNGTS continues to operate under the rates approved by FERC in PNGTS' most recent rate proceeding, effective December 1, 2010. PNGTS has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding. 
 Iroquois  Iroquois operates under rates established pursuant to a settlement approved by FERC in October 2016. Under the settlement, Iroquois rates decreased ratably during the phase-in period from September 2016 through 2018 with an overall reduction of approximately 20 percent beginning September 2018. The settlement also contains a rate moratorium until September 1, 2020. Unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement, Iroquois will be required to establish new rates no later than September 1, 2022.

  The 2017 Tax Act and FERC's Income Tax Recovery Inquiry
On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This legislation provides for major changes to U.S. tax law with the most significant change being the reduction of the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. As mentioned in the section Narrative Description of Business  General and Note 2 of the Partnership's consolidated financial statements included in Part IV within Item 15. "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules", we are a non-taxable master limited partnership, and income taxes owed as a result of our earnings are the responsibility of our partners. However, all of our pipeline systems are regulated by the FERC, which approves the systems' rates on a cost-of-service basis and includes a recovery of our ultimate taxable owners' income tax expense as a nominal component of the maximum allowable rates that may be charged to customers. Ultimate rates charged to customers are typically reached through negotiation without ascribing specific elements of costs of service such as income taxes. 
 In December 2016, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry Regarding the Commission's Policy for Recovery of Income Tax Costs (Docket No. PL17-1-000) requesting Initial Comments regarding how to address any double recovery resulting from FERC's current income tax allowance and rate of return policies that are in effect since 2005. 
 Docket No. PL17-1-000 is a direct response to United Airlines, Inc., et al. v. FERC, a decision issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in July 2016 in which the D.C. Circuit directed FERC to explain how a pass-through entity such as a master limited partnership receiving a tax allowance and a return on equity derived from the discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology did not result in double recovery of taxes. 
 Various comments have been received by FERC and most recently, comments on how the 2017 Tax Act will affect the income tax recovery allowed on regulated pipelines. 
 There is not likely to be a definitive resolution of these issues for some time. The ultimate outcome of Docket No. PL17-1-000 is not certain and could result in changes going forward to FERC's treatment of income tax allowances in the cost of service or to the discounted cash flow return on equity. Depending upon the resolution of these issues, the cost of service rates of any of our interstate natural gas pipelines could be affected to the extent the pipeline proposes new rates or changes to its existing rates or if its rates are subject to complaint or challenged by FERC which would ultimately impact our future operating performance. 
 Review of FERC Natural Gas Pipelines Policy
The current FERC Chairman announced in December 2017 that FERC will review its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. We are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed that will affect our natural gas pipeline business or when such proposals, if any, might become effective. We do not expect that any change in this policy would affect us in a materially different manner than any other similarly sized natural gas pipeline entity operating in the United States. 
Environmental 
 Our pipelines are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including air emissions, biodiversity, wastewater discharges, waste management and water quality. Such laws and regulations generally require natural gas pipelines to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits and other approvals required for construction and operations. Certain violations of environmental laws can result in the imposition of strict, joint and several liability. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action requirements, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in the permitting or performance of projects and/or the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting operations in affected areas. 
 20    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2017

  The following is a discussion of some of the applicable environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business. 
  
The Clean Air Act (CAA)  The CAA and comparable state laws regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including compressor stations, and impose various monitoring, reporting, and in some cases, control requirements. Such laws and regulations may require pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain facilities expected to produce air pollutants or result in an increase of existing air pollutants. Such facilities must also comply with air permits containing various emission and operational limitations, or requiring the use of emission control or abatement technologies, which could result in the imposition of substantial costs on our operations. 

The Endangered Species Act (ESA)  The ESA restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. The presence of threatened or endangered species, including the designation of previously unidentified or threatened species, could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas. 

Solid Wastes and Hazardous Substance and Wastes Statutes  The operations of our pipeline systems are subject to federal and analogous state statutes that regulate the handling, management, storage and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes and hazardous substances. These include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act the Solid Waste Disposal Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, on the federal level and comparable state statutes. These statutes subject our operations to rigorous waste management and disposal practices to ensure compliance. In addition, the improper disposal or a release of wastes or hazardous substance could result in the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations. 

Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)  The TSCA addresses the production, importation, use and disposal of specific chemicals and provides the EPA with authority to require reporting, record-keeping and testing requirements, and restrictions relating to chemical substances and mixtures. These include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos, radon and lead-based paint. 

The Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA)  The CWA, OPA and comparable state laws impose strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into or adjacent to state waters and waters of the U.S. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is generally prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or a delegated state or federal agency. The CWA and federal regulations also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) released a final rule in May 2015 that attempted to clarify federal jurisdiction under the CWA over waters of the U.S. This interpretation by the EPA may constitute an expansion of federal jurisdiction over waters of the U.S. Implementation of the rule has been stayed nationwide, and in January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court accepted review of the rule to determine whether jurisdiction over the challenge to the rule rests with the federal district or appellate courts. In February 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing the EPA and the Corps to review and, consistent with applicable law, initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise the rule. The EPA and the Corps proposed in June 2017 to repeal the June 2015 rule, announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the CWA's jurisdiction, and published a proposed rule in November 2017 that would stay implementation of the June 2015 rule for two years. The Supreme Court ruled in January 2018 that jurisdiction to decide challenges to the rule rests with federal district courts. Consequently, while implementation of the 2015 rule remains stayed, the previously-filed district court cases challenging the scope of rule will be allowed to proceed. As a result of these developments, future implementation of the June 2015 rule is uncertain at this time, but to the extent that this rule or any subsequent replacement rule expands the scope of the CWA's jurisdiction, pipeline construction and expansion projects could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. 

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)  Natural gas transportation activities over federally-managed land or involving federal approval can be subject to review under NEPA, or analogous state requirements. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior or FERC, to evaluate governmental agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an 

 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2017    21

  
Environmental
Assessment that addresses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that
is made available for public review and comment. The current activities of our pipeline systems, as well as any proposed plans for future activities, on federal lands are subject to the requirements
of NEPA in connection with any new approval that is required for construction, operation or use on or of federal lands. NEPA reviews can take a significant amount of time and are subject to challenge
and appeal by environmental groups, who have frequently used the NEPA process to challenge pipeline construction projects over the past several years, and therefore, have the potential to delay
current and future natural gas transportation activities. 

  
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)  The NHPA restricts activities that may affect cultural and historic resources through the implementation of procedural protections that require identification and protection of cultural and historic resources of national, state, tribal and local significance. The presence of cultural and historic resources, including the designation of previously unidentified resources or sites have the potential to delay current and future natural gas transportation activities. 

 We have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring material costs to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations. We have not accrued for any environmental liabilities. 
 Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
 Climate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, and state levels of government to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date, but the EPA has determined that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment and subsequently has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews regarding GHGs for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of conventional pollutant emissions. The EPA has also promulgated regulations requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from, among other sources, certain onshore natural gas transmission and storage facilities, including gathering and boosting facilities and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines between compressor stations in the U.S. on an annual basis. 
 Additionally, while the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, in the absence of any significant activity by Congress in recent years to adopt such legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs. 
 Recent federal rulemakings have focused on the emission of methane, which is considered by the EPA as a GHG. In June 2016, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards, known as Subpart OOOOa, that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards will expand previously issued New Source Performance Standards published by the EPA in 2012, known as Subpart OOOO, by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices, requiring additional controls for modified pneumatic controllers and pumps as well as compressors and imposing leak detection and repair requirements for natural gas compressor and booster stations that are modified through an increase in horsepower. However, over the past year the EPA has taken several steps to delay implementation of the methane rules. In June 2017, EPA proposed to stay the Subpart OOOOa standards for a period of two years and a separate 90-day stay of the standards to provide time for the 2-year stay to take effect while EPA reconsiders implementation of the Subpart OOOOa standards in their entirety. The EPA has not yet finalized the June 2017 proposed rulemaking and, as a result, the June 2016 rule remains in effect but future implementation of the 2016 rules is uncertain at this time. 
 In November 2017, the EPA published two Notices of Data Availability (NODAs) for Subpart OOOOa in the Federal Register and initiated a 30-day public comment period. One NODA relates to the June 2017 two year stay to reconsider the rule and the other NODA relates to the EPA's 90-day stay to cover the 60-day time-period between final publication of the 2-year stay in the Federal Register and the time the proposed 2-year stay takes effect. We do not believe that compliance with the Subpart OOOOa regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations even if the stay is ultimately vacated in court and the rule is fully implemented. However, given the uncertainty of policy and rulemaking regarding this rule the future effects on our pipelines cannot be predicted. 
 22    TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2017


     On an international level, in June 2017, the U.S. Federal government announced its intent to withdraw from the 2015 international climate change agreement known as the Paris Agreement and the U.S. State Department formally notified the United Nations in August 2017 of the United States' intent to withdraw from the agreement. The Paris Agreement requires member countries to review and "represent a progression" in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. Following the U.S. Federal government announcement to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, a number of U.S. State governments announced their commitment to the Paris Agreement. It is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business. However, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that exploration and production operators produce, some of whom are our customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our natural gas transportation services. 
 Finally, it should be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. Significant changes in temperature and other weather events can have many effects on our business, ranging from an impact on demand, availability and commodity prices, to efficiency and output capability. 
 U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)
 Our pipeline systems are subject to federal pipeline safety statutes, such as the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the PSI Act), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, and Enforcement Act of 2006 (the PIPES Act), the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act) and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act), as well as regulations promulgated and administered by the PHMSA. The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities. Pursuant to the authority granted under the NGPSA, PHMSA has promulgated regulations governing pipeline design, installation, testing, maximum operating pressures, pipeline patrols and leak surveys, minimum depth requirements and emergency procedures, as well as other matters intended to ensure adequate protection for the public and to prevent accidents and failures. The PSI Act established mandatory inspections for all U.S. natural gas transportation pipelines, and some gathering lines in high consequence areas (HCAs), which are areas where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences, including high population areas. The PIPES Act required mandatory inspections for certain natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs and required that rulemaking be issued for, among other things, pipeline control room management. Pursuant to the authority granted under the NGPSA, as amended, PHMSA has established a series of rules requiring pipeline operators, such as our operator, TransCanada, Iroquois and MNOC to develop and implement integrity management programs for natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs that require the performance of frequent inspections and other precautionary measures. PHMSA may assess penalties for violations of these and other requirements imposed by its regulations. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act also increases the maximum penalty for violation of pipeline safety regulations from $100,000 to $200,000 per violation per day of violation and also from $1 million to $2 million for a related series of violations. Effective April 27, 2017, to account for inflation, those maximum civil penalties were increased to $209,002 per violation per day, with a maximum of $2,090,022 for a series of violations. 
 The ongoing laws could cause our pipeline systems to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure their continued safe and reliable operation and to comply with the federal pipeline safety statutes and regulations. 
 Additional rule makings regarding pipeline safety are likely. In June 2016, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act was passed, extending PHMSA's statutory mandate through 2019 and, among other things, requiring PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Act. As a result, in May 2016, PHMSA proposed new rules for natural gas transmission and gathering lines that would, if adopted, impose more stringent inspection, reporting, and integrity management requirements on operators. However, to date, no further action has been taken with respect to this 
 TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2017    23

   proposed rulemaking. The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act as further amended by the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, as well as any implementation of PHMSA rules or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance by PHMSA or any other state agencies with respect thereto, could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects, conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, or result in a temporary or permanent reduction in maximum allowable operating pressure, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines, any or all of which could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could be significant, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 There can be no assurance that future compliance with the requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our pipeline systems and the Partnership's financial position, operational costs, cash flow and our ability to maintain current distribution levels to the extent the increased costs are not recoverable through rates. 
 From time to time, despite compliance with applicable rules and regulations, our pipelines may experience incidents that result in leaks and ruptures that may impact the surrounding population and environment. This may result in enforcement by regulatory agencies that may seek civil and/or criminal fines and penalties or third party property damage claims, and could require our pipelines to conduct testing of the pipeline system or upgrade segments of a pipeline unrelated to the incident which costs may not be covered by insurance or recoverable through rate increases. 
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
 Our pipelines are also subject to the requirements of the OSHA and other federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety. In general, we believe that TransCanada's, Iroquois' and MNOC's programs and costs incurred are addressing the OSHA requirements and protecting the health and safety of employees. Based on new regulatory developments, pipeline operators may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards. However, such increases in costs of compliance, and the extent to which they might be recoverable through our pipeline's rates, cannot be estimated at this time. 
 Cyber security 
 We rely on our information technology to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information pipeline operators use to safely operate our assets. We, our operators and other energy infrastructure companies in jurisdictions where we do business continue to face cyber security risks. Cyber security events could be directed against companies in the energy infrastructure industry. 
 A breach in the security of our information technology could expose our business to a risk of loss, misuse or interruption of critical information and functions. This could affect our operations, damage our assets, result in safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational harm, competitive disadvantage, regulatory enforcement actions and potential litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and results of operations. 
 TransCanada, the indirect parent of our General Partner and the operator of most of our assets, has a cyber security strategy which aligns with industry and recognized standards for cyber security. This strategy includes cyber security risk assessments, preventions, continuous monitoring of networks and other information sources for threats to the organization, comprehensive incident response plans/ processes and a cyber security awareness program for employees. TransCanada also has insurance which covers reasonably foreseeable losses due to damage to our facilities, and losses incurred by others, as a result of a cyber security event. These polices do not, however, cover losses that may result from a cyber security event that prevents TransCanada from operating our facilities but does not result in any physical damage. There is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against these threats will be recovered through rates.
