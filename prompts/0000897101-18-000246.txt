Business Highlights 
 
Major Events in 2017
 
In December 2017, the Company acquired the remaining 80-percent stake in Hearing Help Express, Inc. (referred to as “Hearing Help Express” or “HHE”), a direct-to-consumer mail order hearing aid provider, for $650 in cash, repayment of $1,833 in debt to HHE’s 80% holder and an earn-out. The results of HHE were consolidated into the Company’s financial statements beginning October 31, 2016. Prior to the acquisition of 100% ownership in December 2017, the Company allocated income and losses to the noncontrolling interest based on ownership percentage.
 
The Company entered into an agreement to acquire a 49% stake in Soundperience for 1,500 Euros. As of December 31, 2017, the Company held a 16% stake in and obtained a technology license from Soundperience, which investment would increase to 49% upon the completion of certain milestones and payment of the purchase price for that equity. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had an investment in Soundperience of $1,415, consisting of an equity investment, cash advance and license agreement. In January 2018, the Company closed on the additional 33% stake in Soundperience, bringing its total ownership to 49% and its total investment to 1,500 Euros. Soundperience has designed self-fitting hearing aid technology. The Company does not anticipate the Soundperience business will have a notable financial impact on operating results, but rather will provide the Company with exclusive access in the United States to critical software technology. Soundperience’s self-fitting hearing aid technology is being used in the German market today, most notably through Signison, a joint venture with the owner of Soundperience. Soundperience and Signison are accounted for in the Company’s financial statements using either the cost or equity method.
 
In December 2017, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries entered into an Eleventh Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement and Waiver with CIBC Bank USA (formerly known as The PrivateBank and Trust Company), which among other things provided an additional loan of $2,000 under our term note to assist with the acquisition of HHE and provided a capital expenditure loan facility for up to $2,500.

Market Overview:
 
IntriCon serves the body-worn device market by designing, developing, engineering, manufacturing and distributing micro-miniature products, microelectronics, micro-mechanical assemblies, complete assemblies and software solutions, primarily for the emerging value based hearing healthcare market (which includes the hearing health direct to consumer market), the hearing health market, the medical bio-telemetry market and the professional audio communication market. Revenue from these markets is reported on the respective lines in the discussion of our results of operations in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 21 “Revenue by Market” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included herein.
Value Based Hearing Healthcare Market
 
The Company believes the value based hearing healthcare (VBHH) market offers significant growth opportunities. In the United States alone, there are approximately 40 million adults that report some degree of hearing loss. In adults, the most common cause of hearing loss is aging and noise. In fact, by the age of 65, one out of three people have hearing loss. The hearing-impaired population is expected to grow significantly over the next decade due to an aging population and more frequent exposure to loud sounds that can cause noise-induced hearing loss. It is estimated that hearing aids can help more than 90 percent of people with hearing loss, however the current market penetration into the U.S. hearing impaired population is approximately 20 percent, a percentage that has remained essentially unchanged for the last four decades. The primary deterrents to greater penetration are cost and access. The average cost of a hearing aid in the US market today is over $2,400 per device, more than double the cost from twelve years ago. Approximately 70 percent of the hearing impaired have hearing loss in both ears (referred to as a binaural loss), driving the total cost to almost $5,000 on average for a set of hearing aids.
 
We believe a perfect vortex of factors has come together over the last few years to enable the emergence of a market disruptive, high-quality, low cost distribution model, including continued consolidation of retail (causing escalating hearing aid prices), consumer outcry, consumer education, advancements in technology (such as behind-the-ear devices, advanced digital signal processing, low-power wireless, and self-fitting software) as well as regulatory actions and pronouncements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine.
 
Today in the US market, the conventional channel pushes all hearing impaired through the same inefficient, costly channel. However, a very large portion of the hearing-impaired market – mostly notably those with mild to moderate losses – could be properly served with the proper combination of high quality, outcome based devices, advanced fitting software and consumer services/care best practices – all at much lower cost. We believe fundamental change is needed and are excited about the opportunity that we created through thoughtful hard work and planning: a chance to deliver superior outcomes-based affordable hearing healthcare, by combining state-of-the-art devices and software technology, along with best practices customer service and at a much lower cost directly to consumers across the country, many of whom have not been able to afford care previously.
 
In early January 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) weighed in on low hearing aid penetration rates with an announcement that highlighted statistics from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. They found that 37.5 million U.S. adults aged 18 and older report some form of hearing loss. However, only 30 percent of adults over 70, and 16 percent of those aged 20 to 69, who could benefit from wearing hearing aids, have ever used them. Based on these statistics, the FDA reopened the public comment period on draft guidance related to the agency’s premarket requirements for hearing aids and personal sound amplifiers (PSAPs). In April 2016, the FDA hosted a public workshop to gather stakeholder and public input on draft guidance related to the agency’s premarket requirements for hearing aids and PSAPs. The FDA’s intent is to consider ways in which regulation can support further device penetration into the hearing market. In December 2016, the FDA announced important steps to better support consumer access to hearing aids. The agency issued a guidance document explaining that it does not intend to enforce the requirement that individuals age 18 and older receive a medical evaluation or sign a waiver prior to purchasing most hearing aids, effective immediately. It also announced its commitment to consider creating a category of over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids that could deliver new, innovative and lower-cost products to millions of consumers.

Furthermore, there have been significant public policy developments during 2017. On August 18, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law H.R. 2430, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Reauthorization Act, which includes the Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) Hearing Aid Act of 2017. The legislation is designed to enable adults with mild- to moderate-hearing loss to access OTC hearing aids without being seen by a hearing care professional. The OTC Hearing Aid Act requires the FDA to create and regulate a category of OTC hearing aids to ensure they meet the same high standards for safety, consumer labeling, and manufacturing protection that all other medical devices must meet. Additionally, the OTC Hearing Aid Act mandates that the FDA establish an OTC hearing aid category for adults with “perceived” mild- to moderate-hearing loss within three years of passage of the legislation. The FDA also must finalize a rule within 180 days after the close of the comment period, detailing what level of safety, labeling and consumer protections will be included. We believe this legislation has the potential to remove the significant barriers existing today that prevent innovative hearing health solutions. We believe that this legislation will invigorate competition, spur innovation and facilitate the development of an ecosystem of hearing health care that provides affordable and accessible solutions to millions of unserved or underserved Americans. Additionally, these public policy changes all further support our strategic focus to gain direct access to consumers and the underserved market.
 
In December of 2017, we purchased the remaining 80% of HHE, a direct-to-consumer mail order hearing aid provider. Over the last decade, we have invested in the technology and low-cost manufacturing to design and build superior devices and fitting solutions, to address what we estimate to be a $1+ billion annual value based hearing healthcare market. With this acquisition, we believe we now have the channel infrastructure to directly reach consumers and—importantly for millions—the ability to offer high-quality hearing healthcare at a fraction of the cost. Through our other VBHH initiatives and tests, we have formed alliances with other key partners, which have given us experience and vital insight as we move aggressively into a more consumer-facing role. HHE provides an efficient, traditional direct-to-consumer channel to reach consumers who likely do not have insurance that will cover hearing devices. This is a channel that we can build on and expand via technology—and one that is complementary with many of our existing relationships.
 
We entered into an agreement to acquire a 49% stake in Soundperience for 1,500 Euros. As of December 31, 2017, we held a 16% stake in Soundperience, which would increase to 49% upon the completion of certain milestones and payment of the purchase price for that equity. As of December 31, 2017, we had an investment in Soundperience of $1,415, consisting of an equity investment, cash advance and license agreement. In January 2018, we acquired the additional 33% stake in Soundperience for 1,100 Euros, bringing out total ownership to 49% and our total investment to 1,500 Euros. Soundperience has designed self-fitting hearing aid technology. Soundperience’s self-fitting hearing aid technology is being used in the German market today, most notably through our Signison joint venture with the owner of Soundperience.
 
We believe strongly that incorporating self-fitting technology is a critical step in creating our high-quality, low-cost hearing healthcare ecosystem. Soundperience’s technology has the potential to drastically reduce the price of hearing aids, drive greater access and increase customer satisfaction.
 
In other VBHH channels, the Company has a business relationship with hi HealthInnovations (“hi Health”), a UnitedHealth Group company, to be their supplier of hearing aids, which they make available to participants under their health insurance plans.
 
The Company also has various international VBHH initiatives. On November 3, 2015, the Company acquired the assets of PC Werth through its IntriCon UK subsidiary to gain direct access to the NHS and to have greater control over its efforts to accelerate new market penetration into the United Kingdom. IntriCon UK has been appointed as a supplier to the NHS Supply Chain’s National Framework. The NHS is widely seen as the most efficient hearing aid delivery system in the world, supplying an estimated 1.4 million hearing aids annually. We believe IntriCon is well positioned to serve their needs, and we are developing new technologies to further enhance delivery efficiencies and product standards in the future.
 
We also believe there are niches in the conventional hearing health channel that will embrace our VBHH proposition in the United States and Europe. High costs of conventional devices and retail consolidation have constrained the growth potential of the independent audiologist and dispenser. We believe our software and product offering can provide independent audiologists and dispensers the ability to compete with larger retailers, such as Costco, and manufacturer owned retail distributors. In the third quarter of 2015, we announced a joint venture with The Academy of Doctors of Audiology (ADA) to provide hearing instruments and educational resources to audiologists and their patients. The joint venture operates as a limited liability company under the name “earVenture LLC”. EarVenture was officially launched in November 2015 at the ADA conference. To date, more than 400 of the 1,200 ADA members have registered to join the earVenture program. While we do not view earVenture, near term, as a meaningful contributor to sales, it continues to provide valuable industry insights and has the potential for future value by connecting it to our emerging direct-to-consumer channel.

Medical Bio-Telemetry
 
In the medical bio-telemetry market, the Company is focused on sales of bio-telemetry devices for life-critical diagnostic monitoring. The Company manufactures microelectronics, micro-mechanical assemblies, high-precision injection-molded plastic components and complete bio-telemetry devices for emerging and leading medical device manufacturers. The medical industry is faced with pressures to reduce the cost of healthcare. Driven by its core technologies, IntriCon helps shift the point of care from expensive traditional settings, such as hospitals, to less expensive non-traditional settings like the home. IntriCon currently serves this market by offering medical manufacturers the capabilities to design, develop, manufacture and distribute medical devices that are easier to use, are more miniature, use less power, and are lighter. Increasingly, the medical industry is looking for wireless, low-power capabilities in their devices.
 
IntriCon currently has a presence in the diabetes, cardiac, catheter positioning markets. For diabetes, IntriCon has partnered with Medtronic to manufacture their wireless continuous glucose monitors (CGM), sensors, and accessories associated with Medtronic’s insulin pump and CGM system. In August 2016, the FDA approved the MiniMed 630G system which will replace Medtronic’s MiniMed 530G system. In addition to the MiniMed 630G system, IntriCon is also designed into the MiniMed 670G system which was approved by the FDA in September 2016. The MiniMed 670G is the world’s first hybrid closed loop insulin delivery system and we are excited to be designed into and supporting such a revolutionary diabetes management system. In June 2017, the 670G was launched in the U.S. Medtronic began fulfilling orders from patients enrolled in their Priority Access Program. In parallel, Medtronic began taking new orders from interested customers who want to be next in line to receive the system after the Priority Access orders are filled. Looking ahead, we believe there are opportunities to expand our diabetes product offering with Medtronic, as well as move into new markets outside of the diabetes market.
 
IntriCon has a suite of medical coils and micro coils that it offers to various original equipment manufacturing (OEM) customers. These products are currently used in pacemaker programming and interventional catheter positioning applications.
 
IntriCon manufactures bubble sensors and flow restrictors that monitor and control the flow of fluid in an intravenous infusion system as well as a family of safety needle products for an OEM customer that utilizes IntriCon’s insert and straight molding capabilities. These products are assembled using full automation, including built-in quality checks within the production lines.
 
Lastly, IntriCon is targeting other emerging biotelemetry and home care markets that could benefit from its capabilities to develop devices that are more technologically advanced, smaller and lightweight. To do so, IntriCon is leveraging its resources in sales and marketing and research and development to expand its reach to other large medical device and health care companies.
 
In order to focus financial and operational resources on value based hearing healthcare and the growing DTC opportunity, IntriCon made the strategic decision to divest its non-core cardiac diagnostic monitoring business in 2016. The Company sold this business on February 17, 2017 to Datrix, LLC.
 
Professional Audio Communications
 
IntriCon entered the high-quality audio communication device market in 2001, and now has a line of miniature, professional audio headset products used by customers focusing on emergency response needs. The line includes several communication devices that are extremely portable and perform well in noisy or hazardous environments. These products are well suited for applications in the fire, law enforcement, safety, aviation and military markets. In addition, the Company has a line of miniature ear- and head-worn devices used by performers and support staff in the music and stage performance markets. We believe performance in difficult listening environments and wireless operations will continue to improve as these products increasingly include our proprietary nanoDSP, wireless nanoLink and PhysioLink technologies.
 
For information concerning our net sales, net income and assets, see the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Core Technologies Overview: 
 
Our core technologies expertise is focused on three main markets: medical bio-telemetry, value based hearing healthcare and professional audio communications. Over the past several years, the Company has increased investments in the continued development of five critical core technologies: Ultra-Low-Power (ULP) Digital Signal Processing (DSP), ULP Wireless, Fitting Software, Microminiaturization, and Miniature Transducers. These five core technologies serve as the foundation of current and future product platform development, designed to meet the rising demand for smaller, portable, more advanced devices and the need for greater efficiencies in the delivery models. The continued advancements in this area have allowed the Company to further enhance the mobility and effectiveness of miniature body-worn devices.

ULP DSP
DSP converts real-world analog signals into a digital format. Through our nanoDSP™ technology, IntriCon offers an extensive range of ULP DSP amplifiers for hearing, medical and professional audio applications. Our proprietary nanoDSP incorporates advanced ultra-miniature hardware with sophisticated signal processing algorithms to produce devices that are smaller and more effective. The Company further expanded its DSP portfolio including improvements to its Reliant CLEAR™ feedback canceller, offering increased added stable gain and faster reaction time. Additionally, the DSP technologies are utilized in the Audion8™, our eight-channel hearing aid amplifier, and the Audion16™, our wide dynamic range compression sixteen-channel hearing aid amplifier. The amplifiers are feature-rich and are designed to fit a wide array of applications. In addition to multiple compression channels, the amplifiers have a complete set of proven adaptive features which greatly improve the user experience.
 
ULP Wireless 
 Wireless connectivity is fast becoming a required technology, and wireless capabilities are especially critical in new body-worn devices. IntriCon’s BodyNet™ ULP technology, including the nanoLink™ and PhysioLink™ wireless systems, offers solutions for transmitting the body’s activities to caregivers and wireless audio links for professional communications and surveillance products, including diabetes monitoring and audio streaming for hearing devices.
 
IntriCon is in the final stages of commercializing its Physiolink3 wireless technology, which will be incorporated into product platforms serving the medical, hearing health and professional audio communication markets. This system is based on 2.4GHz proprietary digital radio protocol in the industrial-scientific-medical (ISM) frequency band and enables audio and data streaming and command and control to ear-worn and body-worn applications over distances of up to ten meters. The Physiolink3 technology can be used to increase productivity in the emerging VBHH channels through in office wireless programming, remote cloud based fitting and consumer directed self-fitting of hearing aids. This will provide both greater access and lower costs for patients. In addition, remote control functions will improve the patient experience while using the device especially for those with diminished dexterity. The Physiolink3 technology builds on the Physiolink2 capabilities by adding wireless streaming at, what we believe, are much lower power levels than any technology currently on the market. This will allow for accessories to enhance the user experience in noisy environments by allowing audio streaming directly to the hearing aid.
 
Fitting Software 
 The ability to efficiently and effectively fit hearing aids is critical to building a value based eco-system of hearing healthcare. By developing more advanced fitting software systems, individuals can benefit from fittings that conform to their specific loss, while eliminating the need for an in-person appointment. In addition to the traditional fitting software, IntriFit, used in the conventional channel, IntriCon has made significant investments in various advanced fitting software solutions, including its investment in Soundperience, that can enable remote and self-fitting solutions. IntriCon believes these advanced fitting solutions, along with the other components of the eco-system, will drive access, affordability and superior customer satisfaction to the millions of individuals that cannot receive care today, primarily due to high cost and low access. IntriCon expects to introduce our advanced fitting solutions through our various VBHH channels later in 2018.
Microminiaturization 
 IntriCon excels at miniaturizing body-worn devices. We began honing our microminiaturization skills over 30 years ago, supplying components to the hearing health industry. Our core miniaturization technology allows us to make devices for our markets that are one cubic inch and smaller. We also are specialists in devices that run on very low power, as evidenced by our ULP wireless and DSP. Less power means a smaller battery, which enables us to reduce size even further, and develop devices that fit into the palm of one’s hand.
Miniature Transducers 
 IntriCon’s advanced transducer technology has been pushing the limits of size and performance for over a decade. Included in our transducer line are our miniature medical coils and micro coils used in pacemaker programming and interventional catheter positioning applications. We believe that with the increase of greater interventional care, our coil technology harbors significant value.
Marketing and Competition:
 IntriCon intends to focus more capital and resources in marketing and sales to expand its reach into the emerging value based hearing healthcare market and large medical device and healthcare companies in the medical bio-telemetry market outlined above. The Company believes this will allow us to advance our technology portfolio, advance new product platforms, strengthen customer relationships and expand our market knowledge.
 
Currently, IntriCon sells its hearing device products directly to domestic hearing instrument manufacturers, and distributors and partnerships through an internal sales force. Sales of medical and professional audio communications products are also made primarily through an internal sales force. As a result of the investment in Hearing Help Express in 2016, the Company began marketing and selling hearing aid devices directly to consumers through direct mail advertising, internet and a call center.

Internationally, sales representatives employed by IntriCon GmbH (“GmbH”), a wholly owned German subsidiary, solicit sales from European hearing instrument, medical device and professional audio communications manufacturers and suppliers.
 
In recent years, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the Company’s sales. In 2017, one customer in our medical market accounted for approximately 48 percent of the Company’s net sales. During 2017, the top five customers accounted for approximately $56,006, or 63 percent, of the Company’s net sales. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area.
 
IntriCon markets its high performance microphone products to the radio communication and professional audio industries and has several larger competitors who have greater financial resources. IntriCon holds a small market share in the global market for microphone capsules and other related products.
 
Employees. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a total of 670 full time equivalent employees, of whom 72 are executive and administrative personnel, 27 are sales personnel, 30 are engineering personnel and 541 are operations personnel. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a union.
 
As a supplier of consumer and medical products and parts, IntriCon is subject to claims for personal injuries allegedly caused by its products. The Company maintains what it believes to be adequate insurance coverage.
 
Research and Development. IntriCon conducts research and development activities primarily to improve its existing products and proprietary technology. The Company is committed to investing in the research and development of proprietary technologies, such as the ULP nanoDSP and ULP wireless technologies. The Company believes the continued development of key proprietary technologies will be the catalyst for long-term revenues and margin growth. Research and development expenditures were $4,458, $4,688, and $4,279 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts are net of any customer and grant reimbursed research and development.
 
IntriCon owns a number of United States patents which cover a number of product designs and processes. Although the Company believes that these patents collectively add value to the Company, the costs associated with the submission of patent applications are expensed as incurred given the uncertainty of the patents providing future economic benefit to the Company.
 
Regulation. A large portion of our business operates in a marketplace subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies in foreign countries.  In the United States, the FDA regulates the design control, development, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping, and surveillance procedures for medical devices.
 
United States Food and Drug Administration
FDA regulations classify medical devices based on perceived risk to public health as either Class I, II or III devices. Class I devices are subject to general controls, Class II devices are subject to special controls and Class III devices are subject to pre-market approval (“PMA”) requirements. While most Class I devices are exempt from pre-market submission, it is necessary for most Class II devices to be cleared by a 510(k) pre-market notification prior to marketing. A “cleared” 510(k) establishes that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device which was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 or which itself has been found to be substantially equivalent, through the 510(k) process, after May 28, 1976. It is “substantially equivalent” if it has the same intended use and the same technological characteristics as the predicate. The 510(k) pre-market notification must be supported by data establishing the claim of substantial equivalence to the satisfaction of the FDA. The process of obtaining a 510(k) clearance typically can take several months to a year or longer. If the product is notably new or different and substantial equivalence cannot be established, the FDA will require the manufacturer to submit a PMA application for a Class III device that must be reviewed and approved by the FDA prior to sale and marketing of the device in the United States. The process of obtaining PMA approval can be expensive, uncertain, lengthy and frequently requires anywhere from one to several years from the date of FDA submission, if approval is obtained at all. The FDA controls the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and strictly prohibits the marketing of medical devices for unapproved uses. The FDA can require the manufacturer to withdraw products from the market for failure to comply with laws or the occurrence of safety risks.
 
Our wireless and non-wireless hearing aids are air-conduction devices and, as such, are Class I and Class II medical devices. Air-conduction hearing aids are exempt from the 510(k) pre-market notification process. These hearing aids may be marketed either through distribution channels owned, in whole or in part, by IntriCon or through non-affiliated distribution channels. In the latter sense, IntriCon acts as the contract manufacturer to the distributing organization, assisting in design, development and manufacturing. Our manufacturing operations are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, whose primary purpose is to audit the Company’s compliance with the Quality System Regulations published by the FDA (21CFR Part 820) and other applicable government standards. Strict regulatory action may be initiated in response to audit deficiencies or to product performance problems. We believe that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the requirements of the FDA regulations. Our most recent FDA audits were conducted in January of 2017 and in December of 2017. No issues (observations) arising from those audits were noted.

International Regulation 
 International regulatory bodies have established varying regulations governing product standards, packaging and labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax. Many of these regulations are similar to those of the FDA. We believe we are in compliance with the regulatory requirements in the foreign countries in which our medical devices are marketed.
 
Medical device law in the EU requires that our quality system conforms to international quality standards and that our medical devices conform to “essential requirements” set forth by the Medical Device Directive (“MDD”). In order to keep pace with accelerating technical reality and manufacturing risks, medical device law in Europe is changing rapidly. Effective May 5, 2017, the MDD has been replaced with a more broad-reaching Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) with a three-year transition period. IntriCon intends to comply with the MDR prior to the end of the transition period.
 
IntriCon manufacturing facilities are audited annually by an International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) registrar to verify conformity of products and quality systems to the relevant standards and regulations. The ISO registrar for our US facilities is British Standards Institute (“BSI”) while the registrar for our Asian facilities is SGS United Kingdom Ltd.
 
Our European Authorized Representative, CE Partner 4U, audits and retains our technical documentation and registers our products as required with competent authorities in all EU member states. These audits verify that our quality system conforms to the international quality standard ISO 13485 and that our products conform to the “essential requirements” set forth by the MDD for the class of medical devices we produce. These certifications entitle us to place the “CE” mark on our hearing aids distributed in Europe. In 2014, IntriCon obtained “CE” certification for our own hearing aid devices and we are supplying these devices into the European market. Our hearing aids may also bear the CE mark of our customers who then assume regulatory responsibilities for those devices they place on the EU market under their own name.
 
Third Party Reimbursement 
 The availability and level of reimbursement from third-party payers for procedures utilizing our products is significant to our business. Our products are purchased primarily by OEM customers who sell into clinics, hospitals and other end-users, who in turn bill various third party payers for the services provided to the patients. These payers, which include Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance plans and managed care organizations, reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures utilizing our products.
 
In response to the national focus on rising health care costs, a number of changes to reduce costs have been proposed or have begun to emerge. There have been, and may continue to be, proposals by legislators, regulators and third party payers to curb these costs. The development or increased use of more cost effective treatments for diseases could cause such payers to decrease or deny reimbursement for surgeries or devices to favor alternatives that do not utilize our products. A significant number of Americans enroll in some form of managed care plan. Higher managed care utilization typically drives down the payments for health care procedures, which in turn places pressure on medical supply prices. This causes hospitals to implement tighter vendor selection and certification processes, by reducing the number of vendors used, purchasing more products from fewer vendors and trading discounts on price for guaranteed higher volumes to vendors. Hospitals have also sought to control and reduce costs over the last decade by joining group purchasing organizations or purchasing alliances.
