     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
 Overview
 Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing of apparel, footwear and lifestyle products, including denim jeans, related casual wear, footwear and accessories under our Hudson®, Robert Graham® and SWIMS® labels.  We aim to fill a void in the U.S. public market landscape by focusing exclusively on brands that develop products for consumers shopping at premium retailers.  
 We began our operations in April 1987 as Innovo, Inc., or Innovo, a Texas corporation, to manufacture and domestically distribute cut and sewn canvas and nylon consumer products for the utility, craft, sports‑licensed and advertising specialty markets. We have evolved from producing craft and accessory products to designing and selling apparel products bearing various brand names. In 1990, Innovo merged into Elorac Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and was renamed Innovo Group Inc., which was then renamed Joe’s Jeans Inc. in October 2007. In September 2013, we acquired the Hudson Business, a designer and marketer of women’s and men’s premium branded denim apparel. In September 2015, we sold the Joe’s Business (as discussed below). In January 2016, we acquired the Robert Graham Business, which is engaged in the design, development, sales and licensing of sophisticated, eclectic apparel products and accessories, and in connection with the RG Merger (as discussed below), we also changed our name from Joe’s Jeans Inc. to Differential Brands Group Inc. In July 2016, we acquired the SWIMS Business, a Scandinavian-based business engaged in the design, development, sales and licensing of footwear, apparel and accessories.
 Hudson® Acquisition 
 On September 30, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Hudson for an aggregate purchase price consisting of $65.4 million in cash and $27.5 million in convertible notes, net of discount. We also issued promissory notes, bearing no interest, for $1.2 million in aggregate principal amount that were paid on April 1, 2014 to certain option holders of Hudson. Joe’s Sale
 During fiscal 2014 and 2015, we believed that our growth potential relied on the integration of the Hudson Business and Joe’s Business. We did not achieve the desired level of integration on our original timetable. In turn, we failed to meet certain financial covenants set forth in the credit agreement (the “Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement”) with Garrison Loan Agency Services LLC (“Garrison”), and, on November 6, 2014, we received a notice of default and demand for payment of default interest from Garrison, as term loan agent, under that credit agreement. As a result of this default, we were also in default under the terms of our revolving credit agreement (the “CIT Revolving Credit Agreement”) with CIT Commercial Services, Inc. (“CIT”), a unit of CIT Group, and our factoring facility with CIT and we were prohibited from making payments under the above-referenced convertible notes issued in the Hudson acquisition.
 After exploring various strategic alternatives to remedy the defaults, we decided to sell the Joe’s Business. On September 11, 2015, we completed the sale of (i) certain of our intellectual property assets used or held for use in the Joe’s Business for an aggregate purchase price of $67 million pursuant to that certain asset purchase agreement, dated as of September 8, 2015, by and among us, Joe’s Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Joe’s IP Assets Purchaser”), and solely for the purpose of its related guarantee, Sequential Brands Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Joe’s IP Asset Purchase Agreement”), and (ii) among other things, certain inventory and other assets and liabilities related to the Joe’s Business for an aggregate purchase price of $13 million pursuant to that certain asset purchase agreement, dated as of September 8, 2015, by and between us and GBG USA Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Joe’s Operating Assets Purchaser”) (the “Joe’s Operating Asset Purchase Agreement” and together with the Joe’s IP Asset Purchase Agreement the “Joe’s Asset Purchase Agreements”). We operated the Joe’s Business, which included certain inventory and other assets operated under the brand name “Joe’s Jeans,” “Joe’s,” “Joe’s JD” and “else,” from 2001 to 2015.

 The proceeds of the Joe’s Asset Sale were used to repay all of our indebtedness outstanding under the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement and a portion of our indebtedness outstanding under the CIT Revolving Credit Agreement. As a result, the Garrison Term Loan Credit Agreement was paid in full and terminated on September 11, 2015 and we entered into the amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the “CIT Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement”), dated September 11, 2015, which provided for a maximum credit availability of $7.5 million and waived certain defaults. On January 28, 2016, all outstanding loans under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement were repaid and it was terminated in connection with entering into (i) a new credit and security agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as lender, and (ii) a new credit and security agreement with TCW Asset Management Company, as agent, and the lenders party thereto (the “Term Credit Agreement”, and together with the ABL Credit Agreement, the “New Credit Agreements”) and (iii) an amended and restated deferred purchase factoring agreement with CIT. These credit agreements, including certain amendments made to them since the closing date of the RG Merger, are discussed further in “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 After the closing of the Joe’s Operating Asset Purchase Agreement and the Joe’s IP Asset Purchase Agreement, we retained and operated 32 Joe’s® brand retail stores, of which, pursuant to the Joe’s Operating Asset Purchase Agreement, we transferred 18 retail stores to the Joe’s Operating Assets Purchaser on January 28, 2016 for no additional consideration and closed the remaining 14 Joe’s® brand retail stores on February 29, 2016. The retail stores transferred or closed are reported as discontinued operations for 2016 as presented in this Annual Report.
 Robert Graham® Merger
 On January 28, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of RG, as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 8, 2015 (the “RG Merger Agreement”), by and among RG, RG Merger Sub and us, for an aggregate of $81.0 million in cash and 8,825,461 shares of our common stock, par value $0.10 per share (“common stock”) (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split (as defined below)). Pursuant to the RG Merger Agreement, among other things, RG Merger Sub was merged with and into RG, so that RG, as the surviving entity, became our wholly‑owned subsidiary. RG is engaged in the design, development, sales and licensing of lifestyle apparel products and accessories that bear the brand name Robert Graham®.
 Effective upon consummation of the RG Merger, we also changed our name to “Differential Brands Group Inc.” and effected the reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of our issued and outstanding common stock such that each 30 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock were reclassified into one share of our issued and outstanding common stock. The Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value or the amount of authorized shares of our common stock. The primary purpose of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the per‑share market price of our common stock in order to maintain our listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market maintained by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”). Unless otherwise indicated, all share amounts in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.
 In connection with the RG Merger, on January 28, 2016, we completed the issuance and sale of an aggregate of fifty thousand (50,000) shares of our preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share, designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), for an aggregate purchase price of $50 million in cash, as contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, dated as of September 8, 2015 (the “RG Stock Purchase Agreement”), by and between us and TCP Denim, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Series A Purchaser”). As further described in “Part III, Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters,” the Series A Purchaser is affiliated with our major stockholders Tengram Capital Associates, LLC, Tengram Capital Associates II, LLC and other Tengram entities.
 We used the proceeds from the RG Stock Purchase Agreement and the debt financing provided by the credit facilities under the New Credit Agreements to, among other things, consummate the RG Merger and the transactions contemplated by the RG Merger Agreement. Under the acquisition method, RG is deemed the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes, with the Company, as the legal acquirer, being viewed as the accounting acquiree. As a result, the assets, liabilities and operations reflected in the historical consolidated financial statements and in other disclosures in this Annual Report prior to the RG Merger only reflect RG’s historical financial condition and results of

operations for comparative purposes. For more information, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Introduction” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1.”
 Also in connection with the completion of the RG Merger, on January 28, 2016, we completed the exchange of our outstanding convertible notes for (i) 1,167,317 shares of common stock (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split); (ii) a cash payment of approximately $8.6 million; and (iii) an aggregate principal amount of approximately $16.5 million of modified convertible notes (the “Modified Convertible Notes”), as contemplated by the rollover agreement, dated September 8, 2015 (the “Rollover Agreement”), between us and the holders of our convertible notes. The Modified Convertible Notes and Rollover Agreement are discussed further in “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 On January 28, 2016, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the Series A Purchaser and certain of its affiliates, the noteholders party to the Rollover Agreement (including Peter Kim and Fireman Capital CPF Hudson Co-Invest LP) and Michael Buckley, our Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, and subject to certain limitations described therein, we will provide certain demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to shares of common stock (i) issued to the parties to the Registration Rights Agreement in connection with the RG Merger Agreement and the Rollover Agreement and (ii) issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Modified Convertible Notes. 
 In connection with the RG Merger, we changed our fiscal year end to December 31st.
 SWIMS® Acquisition 
 On July 18, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding share capital of Norwegian private limited company (aksjeselskap) SWIMS AS. We purchased SWIMS for aggregate consideration of (i) $12.0 million in cash, (ii) 702,943 shares of our common stock and (iii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 150,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $5.47 per share. The acquisition was completed pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 18, 2016 (the “SWIMS Purchase Agreement”), between us, our wholly-owned subsidiary DFBG Swims, the shareholders of SWIMS named therein (the “SWIMS Sellers”), Øystein Alexander Eskeland and Atle Søvik, acting jointly as the representatives of the SWIMS Sellers, and, for certain limited purposes, TCP Denim, LLC, TCP RG, LLC and TCP RG II, LLC.
 To finance the acquisition, we issued the following to our major stockholder Tengram Capital Partners Fund II, L.P. (“Tengram II”): (i) a warrant for the purchase of 500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share (the “SWIMS Warrant”); and (ii) a convertible promissory note with principal of $13.0 million (the “SWIMS Convertible Note”). As discussed further below, the SWIMS Convertible Note was fully converted into shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock in January 2018. The SWIMS Convertible Note accrued interest at a rate of 3.75% per annum, compounding on the first day of each month starting August 1, 2016, and was convertible, at Tengram II’s option or on its maturity date if not already repaid in cash on or prior to that date, into newly issued shares of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock at a conversion price of $3.00 per share. The Company and Tengram II subsequently amended the maturity date to January 18, 2018. On January 18, 2018, the Convertible Note matured and automatically converted into newly issued shares of the Company’s Series A-1 Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share, at a conversion price of $3.00 per share. The outstanding balance of the Convertible Note, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, converted into 4,587,964 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock. For more information, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 8.”

 Our Brands
 As of December 31, 2017, our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing of apparel, footwear and lifestyle products bearing the Hudson®, Robert Graham® and SWIMS® labels. As a result of the RG Merger and related transactions (the “Merger Transactions”), our strategy has evolved to focus on owning, managing and operating a diversified portfolio of complementary premium consumer brands. We intend to organically grow our current brands and seek opportunities to acquire accretive and complementary premium brands. Hudson®
 Hudson® was established in 2002 and is recognized as a premier designer and marketer of women’s and men’s premium branded denim apparel, an industry term for denim jeans with price points generally of $120 or more, known for its quality, fit and fashion‑forward designs. We sell our products to numerous retailers, which include major department stores, specialty stores, and ecommerce stores in the U.S., Canada and Europe. As of December 31, 2017, our product line included women’s, men’s and children’s denim jeans, bottoms, tops, jackets and other related apparel and accessories. We are also working on the launch of a new sportswear line for Fall 2018. We continue to evaluate offering an additional range of products under the Hudson® brand name. Robert Graham®
 RG’s principal business activity is the design, development, sales and licensing of lifestyle apparel products and accessories that bear the brand name Robert Graham®. Robert Graham® can be described as “American Eclectic.” Since its launch in 2001, Robert Graham® was created based upon the premise of introducing sophisticated, eclectic style to the fashion market as an American‑based company with an intention of inspiring a global fashion movement. Robert Graham® received the 2014 “Menswear Brand of the Year” award from the American Apparel & Footwear Association. During 2016, Robert Graham added the Modern Americana label which targets a younger man requiring a more tailored athletic fit with a fashion basics taste and modestly lower opening price point. This label has been well received among new target customers. Robert Graham® offers a cohesive lifestyle collection that includes knits, polos, sport shirts, t‑shirts, sweaters, sport coats, outerwear, jeans, bottoms, shorts, swimwear and accessories. SWIMS®
 SWIMS’s principal business activity is the design, development, sales and licensing of footwear and apparel products and accessories that bear the brand name SWIMS®. Founded in Norway in 2006, SWIMS is a Scandinavian lifestyle brand best known for its range of fashion-forward, water-friendly footwear for men that artfully balances performance, comfort and style. SWIMS® product line includes women’s and men’s footwear, swimwear, outerwear, ready-to-wear, and accessories.  Reportable Segments
 We manage, evaluate and aggregate our operating segments for segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of business activity and operation. Our reportable segments are Wholesale, Consumer Direct and Corporate and other. Our Wholesale segment is comprised of sales of products to premium department stores, boutiques, retailers, specialty stores, ecommerce stores, international retailers and select off-price retailers. The Wholesale segment also includes expenses from sales and customer service departments, trade shows, warehouse distribution, design and production, and product samples. Our Consumer Direct segment is comprised of sales to consumers through our Robert Graham® brand full-price retail stores, Robert Graham® outlet stores, our SWIMS® brand outlet stores and our online ecommerce sites at www.hudsonjeans.com, www.robertgraham.us and www.swims.com.

 For a breakdown of net sales and gross profits by reportable segment for the last two fiscal years, see “Results of Operations” under “Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016” in “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 Our Principal Products
 Our Hudson® product line includes women’s, men’s and children’s denim jeans, bottoms, tops, jackets and other related apparel and accessories. Hudson’s new sportswear line is expected to launch in Fall 2018. We continue to evaluate offering an additional range of products in the future under the Hudson® brand name. The Hudson® children’s product offerings are produced under a license from us. Hudson sells its merchandise through its retail internet site, premium department stores, specialty stores, ecommerce stores and select off-price retail stores.
 The Robert Graham® product line includes premium priced men’s sport shirts, knits, sweaters, polos, t‑shirts, denim jeans, bottoms, shorts, sport coats, outerwear and swimwear. RG also offers a line of women’s apparel, mainly in its own retail stores. Additionally, men’s shoes, belts, small leather goods, dress shirts, neckwear, tailored clothing, headwear, eye and sun glasses, jewelry, hosiery, underwear, loungewear and fragrances are produced by third parties under various license agreements and RG receives royalty payments based upon net sales from licensees. RG sells its current season merchandise through its retail stores, its retail internet site, premium department stores, specialty stores, ecommerce stores and international stores that display and merchandise its products in a way that supports its brand image and is in sync with the lifestyle and shopping experience expected by its customers. RG sells its prior season merchandise and some “designed‑for‑outlet” product through its own outlet stores and through select off‑price retail stores. 
 SWIMS® product line includes footwear, swimwear, outerwear, ready-to-wear and accessories. SWIMS sells its products worldwide across various channels, including high-end department stores, specialty stores, luxury resorts, and its own website.    Because we focus on design, development and marketing, we rely on third parties to directly manufacture our products for all three of our brands.
 Product Design, Development and Sourcing
 For all of our brands, our product development is managed internally by key designers for each brand. The key designers lead the respective design teams responsible for the creation, development and coordination of the product group offerings. We typically develop four collections per year for (i) spring, (ii) summer, (iii) fall/back‑to‑school, and (iv) winter/holiday (in the case of Hudson®) or resort/cruise (in the case of Robert Graham® and SWIMS®), with certain core basic styles offered throughout the year. The key designers are an instrumental part of our design process. The loss of any key designer would not change any rights we have to the designs or intellectual property. We believe that if any key designers terminate, alternative sources are available for the development and design of the brands product, as applicable. 
 Our products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors, many of whom are located outside of the United States. For fiscal 2017, substantially all of the product for our brands was attributable to manufacturing contractors located outside of the United States, with approximately 25 percent of purchases attributable to manufacturing contractors located in Mexico and approximately 38 percent of purchases attributable to manufacturing contractors located in Asia, including India. Five of our manufacturing contractors represented approximately 59 percent of our total purchases of our products for fiscal 2017. We do not have a long‑term supply agreement with any of our third party manufactures or contractors, and we believe that there are available resources of overseas and domestic contractors that could fulfill our requirements in the event that one of our existing manufacturers would not be able to do so. We control production schedules in order to ensure quality and timely deliveries and conduct all aspects of inventory, warehousing, picking and packing services internally. See “Part I, Item 

 
  9

 
1A. Risk Factors—Problems with sourcing, along with the extent of our foreign sourcing, may adversely affect our business,” “Risk Factors—Our business could suffer as a result of a manufacturer’s inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications or if we need to replace manufacturers” and “Risk Factors—Problems with the third party distribution system could harm our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies.”
 For our brands, we identify fabrics and trims, but primarily have the factories that produce the final product purchase the raw materials. We do not enter into any long term agreements with our suppliers, nor are we substantially dependent on any one of them. We have not experienced any material shortage of raw material to meet our needs. We continue to explore alternate inventory production strategies designed to improve our gross margins. However, there can be no assurance that any change in sourcing will result in enhanced profit margins, similar quality or timely deliveries, but we do believe that continuing to monitor this expense can be beneficial for the growth of our brands. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Increases in the price of raw materials or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and decrease our profitability.” and “Risk Factors—We are dependent on our relationships with our vendors.”
 In the event we terminate any of our relationships with third parties or the economic climate or other factors result in a significant reduction in the number of contractors, our business could be negatively impacted. At this time, we believe that we would be able to find alternative sources for production if this were to occur; however, no assurances can be given that a transition would not involve a disruption to our business.
 We generally purchase our products in United States dollars. However, because we use some overseas or non‑United States suppliers, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Certain of our apparel purchases in the international markets will be subject to the risks associated with the importation of these types of products. See “Business—Import and Export Restrictions and Other Governmental Regulations.”
 While we attempt to mitigate our exposure to manufacturing risks, the use of independent suppliers reduces our control over production and delivery and exposes us to customary risks associated with sourcing products from independent suppliers. Transactions with foreign manufacturers and suppliers are subject to the typical risks of doing business abroad, generally, such as the cost of transportation and the imposition of import duties and restrictions. The countries in which our products are manufactured may, from time to time, impose new quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions, or adjust presently prevailing quotas, duties or tariff levels, which could affect our operations and our ability to import products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict the likelihood or frequency of any such events occurring. See “Business—Import and Export Restrictions and Other Governmental Regulations.” Furthermore, the inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices. Due to the seasonality of our business, and the apparel and fashion business in particular, the dates on which customers require shipments of products from us are critical, as styles and consumer tastes change so rapidly. Because quality is a leading factor when customers and retailers accept or reject goods, any decline in quality by our third‑party manufacturers could be detrimental, not only to a particular order, but also to our future relationship with that particular customer.
 We also require our independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; however, we have no control over the ultimate actions of our independent manufacturers. Despite our lack of control, we have internal operating guidelines to promote ethical business practices and our employees periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—If an independent manufacturer of ours fails to use acceptable labor practices, our business could suffer.”
 Trademarks and License Agreements
 We own a variety of pending applications and registrations throughout the world for a variety of trademarks and service marks, in addition to the common law rights associated therewith for our various brands.

 We also selectively license our brands for certain product categories or for retail stores in foreign jurisdictions. Licensing product categories broadens and enhances the products available under the brand name. In addition, by licensing certain product categories, we receive royalty payments on net sales or purchases of products for sale at the retail stores without incurring significant capital investments or incremental operating expenses. There are certain minimum net sales that the licensees are required to meet, and the agreements generally have renewal rights. As of April 2, 2018, we had two active license agreements for Hudson® and nine for Robert Graham®. Our licensing arrangements for our Hudson® brand are for children’s apparel and the production and distribution of men’s and women’s apparel in Europe and other select countries. For our Robert Graham® brand, our licensing arrangements are for men’s dress shirts, neckwear, tailored clothing, hosiery, leather goods (including bags, belts and small leathers), sun and optical eyewear, headwear, home furnishings, footwear, underwear and loungewear and fragrances. In the future, we may enter into select additional licensing arrangements for product offerings which require specialized expertise. We have historically and may continue to enter into select licensing agreements pursuant to which we may grant third parties the right to distribute and sell our products in certain geographic areas for our brands in exchange for royalty payments and certain minimum guarantees.
 See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties who may not comply with our product quality, manufacturing standards, marketing and other requirements, which may have an adverse effect on our brand equity, reputation or business.”

 Sales and Distribution
 Wholesale
 Domestically, we sell all of our brands’ products through our own showrooms, as well as through independent sales representatives who may have their own showrooms. At our showrooms, retailers review the latest collections offered and place orders. The showroom representatives provide us with purchase orders from retailers and other customers they call upon.
 We also sell our products internationally through distributors in various countries that are managed by us, through licensed stores and licensed distributors. As we develop the internal structure to support our international business, we continue to evaluate our options and review relationships in the marketplace to create a strategy to improve and grow international sales. 
 Consumer Direct
 We also sell our products to consumers through our 30 Robert Graham® brand full-price retail stores and outlet stores, our Robert Graham® catalogs, our 2 SWIMS® brand outlet stores and our online ecommerce sites at www.hudsonjeans.com, www.robertgraham.us and www.swims.com. Advertising, Marketing and Promotion
 At all of our brands, we utilize highly effective marketing tools through our website, mobile application, email campaigns, search engines, affiliates, influencers and various other social media. We refresh our marketing daily to effect the most cutting edge changes in fashion and culture. We rely on these features, as well as the brand recognition criteria by our direct marketing activity, to draw customers to our distribution channels.
 In addition, for our Hudson® brand, we utilize marketing campaigns including strategic placement of advertising in areas of high concentration of consumer traffic through outdoor media advertisements in Los Angeles, California and New York City, print and digital advertising with publications and on specialty online websites. We are increasing our efforts in social media advertising to encourage brand awareness and drive traffic to our ecommerce website at www.hudsonjeans.com.  In addition, we utilize various public relations initiatives to strategically place our products in magazines, editorials, and working with stylists to place product on celebrities and influencers. We also have internal visual merchandisers who work with our customers to create the presentation of our products in their stores to enhance sales and bring the brand DNA to life.
 In addition, for our Robert Graham® brand, our advertising is focused on areas of high traffic around our stand‑alone retail locations, in key zip codes, through short-term billboard advertisements, center publications, in‑center advertising stands, ads within hotel publications and websites that cater to the local marketplace for the purpose of increasing traffic into our stores and to our ecommerce website. We also use event driven marketing (hosted within our owned-retail footprint space) to drive traffic which involves thematic activations and experiences to entice new traffic in the door and retain our current customer base. Windows and in-store displays are merchandised to tell thematic stories aligning to key products and categories we are standing for as a brand in the season. Robert Graham also circulates approximately 700,000 catalogs annually mailed directly to customers’ homes. The catalogs are also utilized for organic and localized prospecting efforts. We work with fashion stylists and celebrity agents to strategically place our products on celebrities for broadcast or within print publications as the opportunities arise. Our social channels also promote content stories that help drive brand awareness and traffic to the brand channels overall and invite a younger demographic to the brand. We also partner with our retailer partners through cooperative advertising programs to promote the brand, where we share the cost of advertising space. Finally, we forge partnerships for relevant brand adjacencies such as Barrett-Jackson, the car auction company and Concours d’elegance car shows, among other partnerships that correspond to our customers' lifestyle. 

 
  12

 

 For our SWIMS® brand, we engage with our customers in the U.S. and Norwegian direct markets via primary digital media channels, including Facebook and Instagram.  In addition, we utilize public relations firms to strategically place our products in magazines and editorials and with stylists.
 Store Operations

We have organized our retail store operations into geographic areas or districts that each have a district manager. District managers are responsible for several stores and monitor and supervise individual store managers. Each store manager is responsible for overseeing the daily operations of one of our stores. In addition to a store manager, the staff of a typical store includes a combination of some or all of the following positions: an assistant store manager and full and part-time sales associates. 
  An essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train and retain talented, highly motivated area managers, store managers and other key employees. In addition to management training programs for both newly hired and existing employees, we have a number of retention programs that offer qualitative and quantitative performance-based incentives to district-level managers, store managers and full-time sales associates.
 Company Operations
 Distribution 

We utilize approximately 76,000 square feet and 35,000 square feet at two third party logistics facilities in New Jersey and California, respectively, to distribute merchandise to our domestic customers. Operations at these facilities include direct to consumer and wholesale fulfillment services, including inventory warehousing, receiving and customer shipping. 

We utilize two third party logistics companies in Canada and Germany to support distribution to approximately one-third of our international customers. Operations at these facilities include wholesale fulfillment services, including inventory warehousing, receiving and customer shipping. Effective December 31, 2017, we terminated our agreement with the third party logistics company in Germany and changed our Hudson European distributor business model to a licensor model. 

We also lease approximately 11,000 square feet and 26,000 square feet of space in two fulfillment and distribution facilities in China and Sweden, respectively. Operations at these facilities support distribution to the remaining two-thirds of our international customers and includes direct to consumer and wholesale fulfillment services, including inventory warehousing, receiving and customer shipping.
 Information Systems

We recognize the need for high-quality information in order to manage merchandise planning, buying, and inventory management and control functions. Robert Graham has invested in a retail software package that meets its processing and reporting requirements. We utilize point-of-sale register systems connected by a secure data network to our home office. Our ecommerce channel, which includes our websites, maintains separate software systems that manage the merchandise and customer information for customer contact and fulfillment functions. In March 2017, we moved our Hudson website to a new platform which is expected to help us better manage and grow their ecommerce business. Our Wholesale segment uses a separately appropriate software system for customer service, order entry, production planning and inventory management.  Customers

Our products are sold to consumers through better department stores and boutiques located throughout the world and, for Robert Graham, through its catalog, website and its stores; for Hudson its website; and for SWIMS, its stores and websites.

 The Hudson® website, www.hudsonjeans.com, the Robert Graham® website, www.robertgraham.us, and the SWIMS® website, www.swims.com, are currently key areas of brand growth and also promote and advance the image of the Hudson®, Robert Graham®, and SWIMS® brands. The sites allow customers to review and purchase online the latest collection of lifestyle fashion. We currently use both online and print advertising to create and reinforce brand awareness.
 We do not enter into long‑term agreements with any of our customers. Instead, we receive individual purchase order commitments. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, including our limited number of private label customers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us, to change their manner of doing business with us, to cancel orders previously placed in advance of shipment dates or a decision to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our net sales and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers, and the loss of any of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.”
 For fiscal 2017, the ten largest customers and customer groups for our business, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 46 percent of our net sales. We believe that we would be able to find alternative customers or increase sales to our existing customer base to purchase our products in the event of the loss of any of these existing customers. During fiscal 2017, our largest customer, Nordstrom, Inc., represented the only customer that was over 10 percent of our net sales. 
 Seasonality of Business and Working Capital
 Products are designed and marketed primarily for the following principal selling seasons: spring, summer, fall/back‑to‑school, winter/holiday and resort/cruise. Typically we have, approximately, a 12 to 14 week turnaround time between the time we book an order at a show and when we ship it. Our primary wholesale booking periods for the retail sales seasons are as follows:

 Hudson®

Retail Sales Season | Primary Booking Period
Spring | September ‑ November 
Summer | November ‑ March 
Fall/Back‑to‑School | February ‑ May 
Winter/Holiday | June ‑ August 

  Robert Graham®

Retail Sales Season | Primary Booking Period
Spring | July ‑ September 
Summer | October ‑ December 
Fall/Back‑to‑School | January ‑ March 
Resort/Cruises | April ‑ June 

  SWIMS®

Retail Sales Season | Primary Booking Period
Spring/Summer | July ‑ September 
Cruise | December - January 
Fall/Winter | January ‑ March 

  We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales. A significant amount of our net sales are realized during the third and fourth quarter when we ship orders taken during earlier months and during the Back-to-School and Holiday seasons. For fiscal 2017, we funded our liquidity needs through cash available under our financing agreements. In fiscal 2018, we plan to continue to fund our liquidity needs through cash from operations and cash available under our financing arrangements. If sales are materially different from seasonal norms, our annual operating results could be materially affected. Accordingly, our results for the individual quarters are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. See “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of our financing agreements and our liquidity position.
 Credit and Collection
 We currently extend credit to a majority of our larger customers, who purchase our products from us at wholesale prices. Our decision to extend credit is based on factors such as credit approval by CIT under our factoring arrangements, past credit history, reputation of creditworthiness within our industry and timelines of payments made to us. The majority of our accounts are guaranteed through credit insurance purchased through CIT. As such, we generally extend this credit without requiring collateral. A small percentage of our customers are required to pay by either cash before delivery, credit card or cash on delivery (“C.O.D.”), which is also based on such factors as lack of credit history, reputation (or lack thereof) within our industry and/or prior payment history. For those customers to whom we extend credit, typical terms are net 30 to 60 days. Based on industry practices, financial awareness of the customers with whom we conduct business and business experience of our industry, our management exercises professional judgment in determining which customers will be extended credit. We are exposed to some collection risk for receivables which were factored with recourse where CIT did not accept the credit risk and receivables that were provided house credit. However, the aggregate amount of exposure is generally low and, therefore, we believe that the credit risk associated with our extension of credit is minimal. Retail and ecommerce sales carry no material credit risk as payment is tendered at or before product is taken or delivered by/ to the customer. Backlog
 Although we may, at any given time, have significant business booked in advance of ship dates, customers’ purchase orders are typically filled and shipped within two to six weeks. As of December 31, 2017, we had future 

 
  15

 
bookings of $30.1 million compared to $38.9 million as of December 31, 2016. The amount of outstanding customer purchase orders at a particular time is influenced by numerous factors, including the product mix, timing of the receipt and processing of customer purchase orders, shipping schedules for the product and specific customer shipping windows. Due to these factors, a comparison of outstanding customer purchase orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments.
 Competition
 The apparel industry in which we operate is fragmented and highly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis. We compete for consumers with a large number of apparel companies similar to ours. We do not hold a dominant competitive position, and our ability to sell our products is dependent upon the anticipated popularity of our designs and brand name, the price and quality of our products and our ability to meet our customers’ delivery schedules. We believe the range of fits and uniqueness of our designs differentiates us from our competitors and we believe that we are competitive with companies producing goods of like quality and pricing. We believe that we can maintain our competitive position through new product development, creating product identity and brand awareness and competitive pricing. Many of our competitors may possess greater financial, technical and other resources, and the intense competition and the rapid changes in consumer preferences constitute significant risk factors in our operations. As we expand globally, we will continue to encounter additional sources of competition. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—We face intense competition in the denim, footwear and premium lifestyle apparel industries. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.” Import and Export Restrictions and Other Governmental Regulations
 Transactions with our foreign manufacturers and suppliers are subject to the general risks of doing business abroad. Imports into the United States are affected by, among other things, the cost of transportation and the imposition of import duties and restrictions. The countries in which our products might be manufactured may, from time to time, impose new quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions, or adjust presently prevailing quotas, duties or tariff levels, which could affect our operations and our ability to import products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict the likelihood or frequency of any such events occurring. The enactment of any additional duties, quotas or restrictions could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and might adversely affect our sales and profitability.
 Our import operations are subject to international trade agreements and regulations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) and other bilateral textile agreements between the United States and a number of foreign countries, including China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Jordan, Korea, Morocco, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Taiwan, Turkey and Vietnam. Some of these agreements impose quotas on the amount and type of goods that can be imported into the United States from these countries. Such agreements also allow the United States to impose, at any time, restraints on the importation of categories of merchandise that, under the terms of the agreements, are not subject to specified limits. Some of our imported products are also subject to United States customs duties and, in the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time subject to claims by the United States Customs Service for duties and other charges. In addition, exports of our products to certain countries are subject to quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions that could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and might adversely affect our sales and profitability. For more information, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—Potential changes in international trade relations implemented by the new U.S presidential administration could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and operating results” and “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—Problems with sourcing, along with the extent of our foreign sourcing, may adversely affect our business.”
 Employees
 As of April 2, 2018, we have 421 total employees, which includes 247 full‑time, 161 part‑time employees and 13 temporary employees. Of our total employees, approximately 37% work in our Wholesale segment, 52% work in our Direct to Consumer segment, and the remaining 11% work in our Corporate and other segment. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
