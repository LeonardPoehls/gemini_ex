ITEM 1.                        DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
Lannett Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company, Lannett, we, or us) was incorporated in 1942 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and reincorporated in 1991 as a Delaware corporation.  We develop, manufacture, market and distribute generic versions of brand pharmaceutical products.  We report financial information on a quarterly and fiscal year basis with the most recent being the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.  All references herein to a fiscal year or Fiscal refer to the applicable fiscal year ended June 30.
 
The Company has experienced total net sales growth at a compounded annual growth rate in excess of 28% over the past sixteen years.  In that time period, total net sales increased from $12.1 million in fiscal year 2001 to $633.3 million in fiscal year 2017.  This growth has been achieved through filing and receiving approvals for abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), strategic partnerships and launches of additional manufactured drugs, opportunities resulting from our strong historical record of regulatory compliance, as well as the acquisitions of Silarx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Silarx) and Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals Inc. (KUPI).
 
All products that we currently manufacture and/or distribute are prescription products with the exception of a small portfolio of over-the-counter products manufactured by Silarx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary.  Our top five products in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 accounted for 53%, 57% and 78% of total net sales, respectively.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
Vertically Integrated Manufacturer, Supplier and Distributor of Narcotics and Controlled Drugs.  In July 2008, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) granted Cody Laboratories, Inc. (Cody Labs) a license to directly import concentrated poppy straw for conversion into opioid-based active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for commercial use in various dosage forms for pain management.  This license, along with Cody Labs expertise in API development and manufacture, allows the Company to perform in a market with high barriers to entry, no foreign dosage form competition and limited domestic competition.  Because of this vertical integration, the Company has direct control of its supply and can avoid increased costs associated with buying APIs from third-party manufacturers, thereby achieving higher margins.
Proven Ability to Develop Successful Products and Achieve Scale in Production.  We believe that our ability to select viable products for development, efficiently develop such products, including obtaining any applicable regulatory approvals, vertically integrate into certain markets and achieve economies of scale in production are critical to our success in the generic pharmaceutical industry.  We intend to focus on long-term profitability driven in part by securing market positions with a limited number of vertically integrated competitors.
Efficient Development Systems and Manufacturing Expertise for New Products.  We believe that our manufacturing expertise, low overhead expenses, skilled product development and marketing capabilities can help us remain competitive in the generic pharmaceutical market.  We intend to dedicate significant capital toward developing new products because we believe our success is linked to our ability to continually introduce new generic products into the marketplace.  Competition from new and other market participants for the manufacture and distribution of certain products would likely affect our market share with respect to such products as well as force us to reduce our selling price for such products due to their increased availability.  As a result, we believe that our success depends on our ability to properly assess the competitive market for new products, including market share, the number of competitors and the generic unit price erosion.  We intend to reduce our exposure to competitive influences that may negatively affect our sales and profits, including the potential saturation of the market for certain products, by continuing to emphasize maintenance of a strong product selection R&D pipeline.
Mutually Beneficial Supply and Distribution Arrangements.  In 2004, we entered into an exclusive ten-year distribution agreement (the JSP Distribution Agreement) with Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals (JSP) covering four different product lines.  On August 19, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with JSP to extend its initial contract to continue as the exclusive distributor in the United States of three JSP products: Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine with Codeine Phosphate Capsules USP; Digoxin Tablets USP; and Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets USP.  The amendment to the original agreement extends the initial contract, which was due to expire on March 22, 2014, for five years.  In connection with the amendment, the Company issued a total of 1.5 million shares of the Companys common stock to JSP and its designees.  In accordance with its policy related to renewal and extension costs for recognized intangible assets, the Company recorded a $20.1 million expense in cost of sales, which represented the fair value of the shares on August 19, 2013.  If the parties agree to a second five-year extension from March 23, 2019 to March 23, 2024, the Company is required to issue to JSP or its designees an additional 1.5 million shares of the Companys common stock.  Both Lannett and JSP have the right to terminate the contract if one of the parties does not cure a material breach of the contract within thirty (30) days of notice from the non-breaching party.  Levothyroxine Sodium and Digoxin collectively accounted for 29% of our total net sales in fiscal year 2017.

During the renewal term of the JSP Distribution Agreement, the Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase minimum dollar quantities of JSP products.  There is no guarantee that the Company will continue to meet the minimum purchase requirement for Fiscal 2018 and thereafter.  If the Company does not meet the minimum purchase requirements, JSPs sole remedy is to terminate the agreement.
 
Dependable Supplier to our Customers.  We believe we are viewed within the generic pharmaceutical industry as a strong, dependable supplier.  We have cultivated strong and dependable customer relationships by maintaining adequate inventory levels, employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of those orders.  A majority of our orders are filled and shipped on or the day after we receive the order.
 
Strong Track Record of Obtaining Regulatory Approvals for New Products.  During the past three fiscal years, we have received numerous approved ANDA /ANDA supplements from the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA).  Although the timing of ANDA approvals by the FDA is uncertain, we currently expect to receive several more during Fiscal 2018.  These regulatory approvals will enable us to manufacture and supply a broader portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products.
Reputation for Regulatory Compliance.  We have a strong track record of regulatory compliance.  We believe that we have strong effective regulatory compliance capabilities and practices due to the hiring of qualified individuals and the implementation of strong current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).  Our agility in responding quickly to market events and a reputation for regulatory compliance position us to avail ourselves of market opportunities as they are presented to us.
 
In addition, narcotics which are classified by the DEA as controlled drugs are subject to a rigorous regulatory compliance regimen.  We have been granted a license from the DEA to import raw concentrated poppy straw for conversion into commercial APIs.  Such licenses are renewed annually and non-compliance could result in a license not being renewed.  As a result, we believe that our strong reputation for regulatory compliance allows us to have a competitive edge in managing the production and distribution of controlled drugs.
 
Business Strategies
 
Continue to Broaden our Product Lines Through Internal Development and Strategic Partnerships.
 
We are focused on increasing our market share in the generic pharmaceutical industry while concentrating additional resources on the development of new products, with an emphasis on controlled substance products.  We continue to improve our financial performance by expanding our line of generic products, increasing unit sales to current customers, creating manufacturing efficiencies and managing our overhead and administrative costs.
 
We have four strategies for expanding our product offerings: (1) deploying our experienced R&D staff to develop products in-house; (2) entering into product development agreements or strategic alliances with third-party product developers and formulators; (3) purchasing ANDAs from other generic manufacturers; and (4) marketing drugs under brand-names.  We expect that each strategy will facilitate our identification, selection and development of additional pharmaceutical products that we may distribute through our existing network of customers.
 
In 2016, the Company announced a strategic partnership with YiChang HEC ChangJiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, an HEC Group company, to co-develop a generic insulin pharmaceutical product for the U.S. market.  The product is currently in late stage development.  The Company will manage the remaining clinical and regulatory steps specific for a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) license to market and will have the exclusive U.S. marketing rights to the product.
 
We have several existing supply and development agreements with both international and domestic companies; in addition, we are currently in negotiations on similar agreements with additional companies through which we can market and distribute future products.  We intend to capitalize on our strong customer relationships to build our market share for such products.
 
Mergers and Acquisitions.
 
We are active in evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions opportunities that are a strategic fit and accretive to our business.  We are particularly interested in opportunities that globalize our business, further vertically integrate our operations, or enhance shareholder value through tax favorable jurisdiction treatment.  During Fiscal 2016, we completed the acquisition of KUPI, the former subsidiary of global biopharmaceuticals company UCB S.A.  KUPI is a U.S. specialty pharmaceuticals manufacturer focused on the development of products that are difficult to formulate or utilize specialized delivery technologies.  Strategic benefits of the acquisition include expanded manufacturing capacity, a diversified product portfolio and pipeline and complementary R&D expertise.

Improve our Operating Profile in Certain Targeted Specialty Markets.
 
In certain situations, we may increase our focus on particular specialty markets within the generic pharmaceutical industry.  By narrowing our focus to specialty markets, we can provide product alternatives in categories with relatively fewer market participants.  We plan to strengthen our relationships with strategic partners, including providers of product development research, raw materials, APIs and finished products.  We believe that mutually beneficial strategic relationships in such areas, including potential financing arrangements, partnerships, joint ventures or acquisitions, could enhance our competitive advantages in the generic pharmaceutical market.
Leverage Ability to Vertically Integrate as a Manufacturer, Supplier and Distributor of Controlled Substance Products.
 
One initiative that is at the core of the Companys strategy is to continue leveraging the asset we acquired in 2007, Cody Labs.  In July 2008, the DEA granted Cody Labs a license to directly import concentrated poppy straw for conversion into opioid-based commercial APIs for use in various dosage forms for pain management.  The value of this license comes from the fact that, to date, only a limited number of companies in the U.S. have been granted this license.  This license, along with Cody Labs expertise in API development and manufacture, allows the Company to perform in a market with high barriers to entry, no foreign dosage form competition and limited domestic competition.  Because of this vertical integration, the Company has direct control of its supply and can avoid increased costs associated with buying APIs from third-party manufacturers, thereby achieving higher margins.  The Company can also leverage this vertical integration not only for direct supply of opioid-based APIs, but also for the manufacture of non-opioid-based APIs.  In January 2017, the Company announced a $50 million expansion plan in conjunction with Forward Cody, an unrelated non-profit economic development corporation, (Forward Cody) to expand our operations in Cody, WY.
 
The Company believes that the demand for controlled substance, pain management drugs will continue to grow as the Baby Boomer generation ages.  By concentrating additional resources in the development of opioid-based APIs and abuse deterrent features to current dosage forms as well as drugs to treat addiction to opioids, the Company is well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity.  The Company is currently vertically integrated on three products with several others in various stages of development.
 
Key Products
 
Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets
 
Levothyroxine Sodium tablets, which are used for the treatment of thyroid deficiency by patients of various ages and demographic backgrounds, are the most prescribed drug in the United States. The product is manufactured by JSP and distributed by us under the JSP Distribution Agreement and is produced and marketed in 12 potencies. Net sales of Levothyroxine Sodium tablets totaled $174.0 million in fiscal year 2017. Levothyroxine is a narrow therapeutic index drug and very difficult to formulate which results in a less competitive market environment for this molecule. In our distribution of these products, we compete with two brand Levothyroxine Sodium products, AbbVies Synthroid and Pfizers Levoxyl, as well as generic products from Mylan and Sandoz.
Fluphenazine Tablets
 
Fluphenazine tablets are used for the treatment of antipsychosis.  Net sales of Fluphenazine tablets totaled $54.0 million in fiscal year 2017.  Currently, our primary generic competitor for this drug is Mylan.
Digoxin Tablets
 
Digoxin tablets, which are used to treat congestive heart failure in patients of various ages and demographics, are produced and marketed with two different potencies. This product is manufactured by JSP and we distribute it under the JSP Distribution Agreement. Net sales of this product totaled $9.5 million in fiscal year 2017. The product is highly potent based on Environment, Health & Safety (EHS), regulations and its API availability is limited given there are only two active suppliers, based on the FDA Drug Master File (DMF) list.  In our distribution of these products, we compete with generic products from Mylan, Impax, West-Ward as well as the brand product Lanoxin distributed by Concordia and an authorized generic (AG) distributed by Par.
Acetazolamide Tablets
 
Acetazolamide tablets are used for the treatment of glaucoma. The product is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces fluid pressure in the eyeball. It also increases the removal of water from the body by the kidneys and may block certain nerve discharges that may contribute to seizures. Net sales of Acetazolamide tablets totaled $18.8 million in fiscal year 2017.  Currently, our primary generic competitors for this drug are Heritage and Taro.
Butalbital Products
 
We distribute three products containing Butalbital.  We have manufactured and sold Butalbital with Aspirin and Caffeine capsules for more than 25 years.  Butalbital with Aspirin, Caffeine and Codeine Phosphate capsules are manufactured by JSP and distributed under the JSP Distribution Agreement.  Additionally, in September 2012, the Company was approved to sell Butalbital, Acetaminophen and Caffeine Tablets.

Butalbital products, which are orally administered in capsule or tablet dosage forms, are prescribed to treat migraines and tension headaches caused by contractions of the muscles in the neck and shoulder area.  The drug is prescribed primarily for adults of various demographics.  Migraines are an increasingly prevalent condition in the United States, and we believe the demand for effective medical treatments will continue to increase.  Net sales of Butalbital products totaled $19.6 million in fiscal year 2017. Although new innovator drugs to treat migraines have been introduced by brand-name drug companies, we believe that there is still a loyal following of doctors and consumers who prefer to use Butalbital products for treatment.  In our distribution of these products, we compete with products from Mallinckrodt, Mikart, Qualitest, Watson, West-Ward, Teva and Breckenridge.
 
Ursodiol Capsules
 
Ursodiol Capsules are produced and marketed in 300 mg capsules and are used for the treatment of gallstones.  Net sales of Ursodiol capsules totaled $48.6 million in fiscal year 2017.  We compete with generic products from Epic and Mylan, as well as the brand product Actigall distributed by Teva.
Omeprazole Capsules
 
Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that decreases the amount of acid produced in the stomach. The product is a generic version of the branded drug Prilosec®. It is indicated for heartburn or irritation of the esophagus caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease. KUPI produces Omeprazole DR capsules in 10mg, 20mg and 40mg dosages. Net sales of Omeprazole capsules totaled $25.3 million in fiscal year 2017. In distributing this product, we compete primarily with Sandoz, Dr. Reddys and Zydus.
Methylphendiate Hydrochloride ER
 
Methylphenidate ER is a central nervous system stimulant indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children six years of age and older, adolescents and adults up to the age of 65. The product is a generic version of the branded drug Concerta®, which is currently marketed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and competes with a generic product marketed by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals and Mylan as well as an AG marketed by Teva. The product was approved by the FDA in 2013 with a therapeutic equivalence rating of AB, meaning the FDA deemed it therapeutically equivalent to the brand-name drug, Concerta®.  Net sales of Methylphenidate ER tablets totaled $32.7 million in fiscal year 2017.
 
During a teleconference in November 2014, the FDA informed KUPI that it had concerns about whether generic versions of Concerta® (methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release tablets), including KUPIs Methylphenidate ER product, are therapeutically equivalent to Concerta®.  The FDA indicated that its concerns were based in part on adverse event reports concerning lack of effect and its analyses of pharmacokinetic data.  The FDA informed KUPI that it was changing the therapeutic equivalence rating of its product from AB (therapeutically equivalent) to BX.  A BX-rated drug is a product for which data are insufficient to determine therapeutic equivalence; it is still approved and can be prescribed, but the FDA does not recommend it as automatically substitutable for the brand-name drug at the pharmacy.
 
During the November 2014 teleconference, the FDA also asked KUPI to either voluntarily withdraw its product or to conduct new bioequivalence (BE) testing in accordance with the recommendations for demonstrating bioequivalence to Concerta proposed in a new draft BE guidance that FDA issued earlier that November.  The FDA had approved the KUPI product (and originally granted it an AB rating) in 2013, on the basis of KUPI data showing its product met bioequivalence criteria set forth in draft bioequivalence guidance that FDA had issued in 2012.  The FDAs position concerning the KUPI product was the subject of a public announcement by the agency.  The Company agreed to conduct new bioequivalence studies per the new draft bioequivalence guidance.  KUPI submitted the data from those studies to FDA in June 2015. The Company continues to pursue the FDA to obtain its decision on the submitted study as well as its response on whether it will restore the AB-rating for our product.
 
On October 18, 2016, the Company received notice from the FDA that it will seek to withdraw approval of the Companys ANDA for Methylphenidate ER.  The FDAs notice includes an opportunity for the Company to request a hearing on this matter.  The Company initially had until November 17, 2016 to request the hearing and until December 19, 2016 to submit all data, information and analyses upon which the request for a hearing relies.
 
On November 30, 2016, the Company announced that the FDA granted a 90-day extension to submit documentation related to the hearing request.  On February 22, 2017, the Company announced that the FDA suspended indefinitely the deadline to submit supporting documentation related to the hearing request in order to give the FDA additional time to retrieve documents requested by the Company.
 
Pain Management Products
 
Cocaine Topical® Solution (C-Topical®), a vertically integrated product, is produced and marketed under a preliminary new drug application (PIND) in two different strengths and two different size containers.  C-Topical® is utilized primarily for the anesthetization of the patient during ear, nose or throat surgery, sinuplasty and in emergency rooms.
 
7




The Company has completed a Phase III clinical trial and our Clinical Research Organization (CRO) is assembling the data for our New Drug Application (NDA) for C-Topical® and continues to actively market the product utilizing a group of brand representatives in key market locations throughout the United States.
 
Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution is produced and marketed in three different size containers.  We manufacture this product at Cody Labs and are currently finishing the manufacturing methods and capabilities to make the API.  This drug is prescribed primarily for the management of pain in adults.
 
Oxycodone HCl Oral Solution (Oxycodone) was produced until August 20, 2012 and marketed until October 4, 2012 in two different size containers, at which point, as a result of FDA enforcement actions against all market participants, the Company voluntarily exited the market.  Prior to the enforcement actions the Company had submitted an ANDA to the FDA and subsequently received approval and commenced shipping Oxycodone in September 2014.  This drug is prescribed primarily for the management and relief of moderate to moderately severe pain.
 
Other products in the pain management franchise include Hydromorphone HCl tablets, which we are vertically integrated, and Codeine Sulfate tablets.  Additionally, the Company added several pain management products through the Silarx acquisition.  Net sales of pain management products totaled $26.1 million in fiscal year 2017.
 
Validated Pharmaceutical Capabilities
 
Lannetts 31,000 square foot manufacturing facility sits on 3.5 acres of Company-owned land.  In addition, we own a 63,000 square foot building residing on 3.0 acres of Company-owned land.  This facility is located within one mile of our manufacturing facility.  The facility houses our Quality Control (QC) laboratories, packaging and research and development and has capacity for additional manufacturing space, if needed.  We also own a 66,000 square foot building on 7.3 acres of land, which is used for certain administrative functions, warehouse space and shipping.  It also has capacity for additional manufacturing space, if needed.  All three of these buildings are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
 
The manufacturing facility of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cody Labs, consists of an approximately 73,000 square foot facility located on 15.0 acres of land in Cody, Wyoming.  Cody Labs leases the facility from Cody LCI Realty, LLC (Realty), a variable interest entity (VIE) in which the Company had a 50% ownership interest until November 30, 2016, when the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest.
 
The Silarx manufacturing facility consists of an 110,000 square foot facility located in Carmel, New York and sits on 25.8 acres of land.  The facility currently houses manufacturing, packaging, research and development and has capacity for additional manufacturing space, if needed.
 
In November 2015, we completed the acquisition of KUPI.  KUPIs 432,000 square foot Seymour, Indiana facility contains approximately 107,000 square feet of manufacturing space as well as a leased 116,000 square foot temperature/humidity controlled storage warehouse.  Seymour has had satisfactory inspections conducted by the FDA and EMA and similar regulatory authorities of Japan, Taiwan, Brazil, Korea and Turkey.  Since 2008, KUPI has made significant improvements to its facility and equipment.  These improvements enabled the facility to increase production from approximately 1.2 billion doses in 2008 to over 2.7 billion doses in 2014.  KUPI also completed a 20,000 square foot expansion of the facility which increased capacity to 3.9 billion doses.
 
We have adopted many processes in support of regulations relating to cGMPs in the last several years and we believe we are operating our facilities in substantial compliance with the FDAs cGMP regulations.  In designing our facilities, full attention was given to material flow, equipment and automation, quality control and inspection. A granulator, an automatic film coating machine, high-speed tablet presses, blenders, encapsulators, fluid bed dryers, high shear mixers, high-speed bottle filling and high potency or specialized manufacturing suites are a few examples of the sophisticated product development, manufacturing and packaging equipment used in the production process.  In addition, our Quality Control laboratory facilities are equipped with high precision instruments, such as automated liquid chromatographs (HPLC and UPLC), gas chromatographs and laser particle size analyzers.
 
We continue to pursue Quality by Design for improving and maintaining quality control and quality assurance programs in our pharmaceutical development and manufacturing facilities, which is outlined in the FDA report entitled, Pharmaceutical Quality for the 21st Century: A Risk-Based Approach.  The FDA periodically inspects our production facilities to determine our compliance with the FDAs manufacturing standards.  Typically, after completing its inspection, the FDA will issue a report, entitled a Form 483, containing observations arising from an inspection.  The FDAs observations may be minor or severe in nature and the degree of severity is generally determined by the time necessary to remediate the cGMP violation, any consequences to the consumer of the products and whether the observation is subject to a Warning Letter from the FDA. By strictly complying with cGMPs and the various FDA guidelines, Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs), as well as adherence to our Standard Operating Procedures, we have never received a cGMP Warning Letter in more than 70 years of business.

Research and Development Process
 
Over the past several years, we have invested heavily in R&D projects.  The costs of these R&D efforts are expensed during the periods incurred.  We believe that such costs may be recovered in future years when we receive approval from the FDA to manufacture and distribute such products.  We have embarked on a plan to grow in future years, which includes organic growth to be achieved through our R&D efforts.  We expect that our growing list of generic products under development will drive future growth.  Over the past several years, we have hired additional personnel in product development, production and formulation.  The following steps outline the numerous stages in the generic drug development process:
1.)          Formulation and Analytical Method Development.  After a drug candidate is selected for future sale, product development scientists perform various experiments in order for the binding agents or lubricants to incorporate APIs into a dosage form that will then, not only be therapeutically equivalent to the brand name drug, but match its size and shape as well.  These experiments will result in the creation of a number of product formulations to determine which formula will be most suitable for our subsequent development process.  Various formulations are tested in the laboratory to measure results against the innovator brand drug.  During this time, we may use reverse engineering methods on samples of the innovator drug to determine the type and quantity of inactive ingredients.  During the formulation phase, our R&D chemists begin to develop an analytical, laboratory testing method.  The successful development of this test method will allow us to test developmental and commercial batches of the product in the future.  All of the information used in the final formulation, including the analytical test methods adopted for the generic drug candidate, will be included as part of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) section of the ANDA submitted to the FDA.
2.)          Scale-up and Tech Transfer.  After product development, scientists and the R&D chemists agree on a final formulation for use in moving the drug candidate forward in the developmental process, we then attempt to increase the batch size of the product.  The batch size represents the standard magnitude to be used in manufacturing a batch of the product.  The determination of batch size affects the amount of raw material that is used in the manufacturing process and the number of expected dosages to be created during the production cycle.  We attempt to determine batch size based on the amount of active ingredient in each dosage, the available production equipment and unit sales projections.  The scaled-up batch is then generally produced in our commercial manufacturing facilities.  During this manufacturing process, we document the equipment used, the amount of time in each major processing step and any other steps needed to consistently produce a batch of that product.  This information, generally referred to as the validated manufacturing process, is included in the ANDA.
3.)          Bioequivalency and Clinical Testing.  After a successful scale-up of the generic drug batch, we schedule and perform generally required bioequivalency testing on the product and in some cases, clinical testing if required by the FDA.  These procedures, which are generally outsourced to third parties, include testing the absorption of the generic product in the human bloodstream compared to the absorption of the innovator drug.  The results of this testing are then documented and reported to us to determine the success of the generic drug product.  Success, in this context, means that we are able to demonstrate that our product is comparable to the innovator product in dosage form, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use.
 
Bioequivalence (meaning that the product performs in the same manner and in the same amount of time as the innovator drug) and a stable formula are the primary requirements for a generic drug approval (assuming the manufacturing plant is in compliance with the FDAs cGMP regulations).  With the exception of 505(b)(2) NDA filings, lengthy and costly clinical trials proving safety and efficacy, which are required by the FDA for innovator drug approvals, are typically unnecessary for generic companies.  If the results are successful, we will continue the collection of information and documentation for assembly of the drug application.
 
4.)          Submission of the ANDA for FDA Review and Approval.  The ANDA process became formalized under The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act (Hatch-Waxman Act).  The Hatch-Waxman Act amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to permit the FDA to review and approve an ANDA for a generic equivalent of a new drug product, which previously received FDA approval through its new drug approval process, without having the generic drug company conduct costly clinical trials.  An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures.
 
We currently file our ANDAs and NDAs electronically.  On July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act was enacted, which included the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (GDUFA).  Under these Amendments the FDA committed to reviewing 90% of complete electronic generic applications within 10 months after the date of submission.  Applications filed after October 2014 are reviewed under this process.  While we have received approval for some of our ANDAs in as little as 14 months, we have also waited longer than 77 months before receiving approval.  The FDA has advised that electronic submissions of applications may shorten the approval process, however ANDAs and NDAs submitted for our products may not receive FDA approval on a timely basis, or at all.

When a generic drug company files an ANDA with the FDA, it must certify either that (i) no patent was filed for the listed drug (a paragraph I certification), (ii) the patent has expired (a paragraph II certification), (iii) the patent will expire on a specified date and the ANDA filer will not market the drug until that date (a paragraph III certification), or (iv) the patent is invalid or would not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the new drug (a paragraph IV certification). A paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA refers.  A paragraph IV certification can trigger an automatic 30 month stay of the ANDA if the innovator company files a claim which would delay the approval of the generic companys ANDA.
 
As of June 30, 2017, we have 9 paragraph IV certifications pending with the FDA.  Three of the P-IV certifications are currently being challenged.  In response to our P-IV certification with respect to the Zomig® nasal spray product, AstraZeneca AB, AstraZeneca UK Limited and Impax Laboratories, Inc. filed two patent infringement complaints against the Company in July 2014.  In response to our P-IV certification with respect to Thalomid®, Celgene Corporation and Childrens Medical Center Corporation filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Company in January 2015.  In response to our P-IV certification with respect to Suprep®, Braintree Laboratories, Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Company in March 2017.  Refer to Note 12 Legal, Regulatory Matters and Contingencies for further information on the current status of the aforementioned P-IV challenges.
 
Sales and Customer Relationships
 
We sell our pharmaceutical products to generic pharmaceutical distributors, drug wholesalers, chain drug retailers, private label distributors, mail-order pharmacies, other pharmaceutical manufacturers, managed care organizations, hospital buying groups, governmental entities and health maintenance organizations.  We promote our products through direct sales, trade shows and bids.  Our practice of maintaining adequate inventory levels, employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of those orders have contributed to a strong reputation among our customers as a dependable supplier of high quality generic pharmaceuticals.
Management
 
We have been focused on enhancing the quality of our management team in anticipation of continuing growth.  As part of our growth, we have established corporate and non-corporate officer positions.  We have hired experienced personnel from large, established, brand pharmaceutical companies as well as competing generic companies to complement the skills and knowledge of the existing management team.  As we continue to grow, additional personnel may need to be added to our management team.  We intend to hire the best people available to expand the knowledge base and expertise within our personnel ranks.

Unlike brand, innovator companies, we generally do not develop new molecules.  However, we have filed and received two patents for APIs at our Cody, Wyoming manufacturing facility, with additional patents in process. Additionally, the Company has completed the Phase III clinical trial and our CRO is assembling the data for our New Drug Application.  The Company continues to actively market the product utilizing a group of brand representatives in key market locations throughout the United States.
 
In fiscal year 2017, we received several ANDA/ANDA supplement approvals from the FDA.  The following summary contains more specific details regarding our latest ANDA approvals.  Market data was obtained from Wolters Kluwer and IMS.

For the 12 months ended April 2017, total U.S. sales of Niacin Extended-Release Tablets USP, 500 mg and 1000 mg, at AWP were approximately $152.0 million, according to IMS.
 
In June 2017, we also received approval to market and launch Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets USP, 5 mg/300 mg, 7.5 mg/300 mg and 10 mg/300 mg, the therapeutic equivalent to the reference standard drug, Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets USP, 5 mg/300 mg, 7.5 mg/300 mg and 10 mg/300 mg, of Mikart, Inc. The product is also marketed under the brand names Vicodin®, Vicodin ES® and Vicodin HP®.  For the twelve months ended April 2017, total U.S. sales of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets USP, 5 mg/300 mg, 7.5 mg/300 mg and 10 mg/300 mg, at AWP were approximately $67.1 million, according to IMS.
 
In June 2017, we also received approval to market and launch Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets USP, 5 mg/325 mg, 7.5 mg/325 mg and 10 mg/325 mg, the therapeutic equivalent to the reference listed drug, Norco® Tablets, 5 mg/325 mg, 7.5 mg/325 mg, and 10 mg/325 mg, of Allergan Pharmaceuticals International Limited.  The product is also marketed under the brand name Lortab® 5 mg/325 mg, 7.5 mg/325 mg, and 10 mg/325 mg.  For the twelve months ended April 2017, total U.S. sales of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets USP, 5 mg/325 mg, 7.5 mg/325 mg and 10 mg/325 mg, at AWP were approximately $744.3 million, according to IMS.
 
We have additional products currently under development which are orally administered solid oral-dosage products (i.e., tablet/capsule) or oral solutions, nasal, topicals or parentarels, as well as other dosage forms designed to be generic equivalents to brand-named innovator drugs.  Our developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications.  The products under development are at various stages in the development cycleformulation, scale-up, clinical testing and FDA review.
 
The cost associated with each product that we are currently developing is dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to, the complexity of the active ingredients chemical characteristics, the price of the raw materials and the FDA-mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies (depending on the FDAs Orange Book classification).  With the introduction of GDUFA and additional guidance issued by the FDA, the cost to develop a new generic product varies but now totals several million dollars.
 
In addition, we currently own several ANDAs that are dormant for products which we currently do not manufacture and market.  Occasionally, we review such ANDAs to determine if the market potential for any of these older drugs has recently changed to make it attractive for us to reconsider manufacturing and selling.  If we decide to introduce one of these products into the consumer market, we must review the original ANDA and related documentation to ensure that the approved product specifications, formulation and other factors meet current FDA requirements for the marketing of the applicable drug.  Generally, in these situations, we file a supplement to the FDA for the applicable ANDA, informing the FDA of any significant changes in the manufacturing process, the formulation, the raw material supplier, or another major feature of the previously approved ANDA.  We would then redevelop the product and submit it to the FDA for supplemental approval.  The FDAs approval process for an ANDA supplement is similar to that of a new ANDA.
 
In addition to the efforts of our internal product development group, we have contracted with numerous outside firms for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products.  These outsourced R&D products are at various stages in the development cycleformulation, analytical method development and testing and manufacturing scale-up.  These products include orally administered solid dosage products, injectables and nasal delivery products that are intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications.  
 
12




We intend to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for some of these R&D products to our own commercial manufacturing sites.  We initiated these outsourced R&D efforts to complement the progress of our own internal R&D efforts.  As of June 30, 2017, we had 19 ANDAs awaiting review and approval at the FDA.
 
We recorded R&D expenses of $42.1 million in fiscal year 2017, $45.1 million in fiscal year 2016 and $30.3 million in fiscal year 2015.  These amounts included expenses associated with bioequivalence studies, internal development resources as well as outsourced development.  While we manage all R&D from our principal executive office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, we have also been taking steps to capitalize on favorable development costs in other countries.  We have strategic relationships with various companies that either act as contract research organizations or API suppliers as well as dosage form manufacturers.  In addition, U.S.-based research organizations have been engaged for product development to enhance our internal development.  Fixed payment arrangements are established between Lannett and these research organizations and in some cases include a royalty provision.  Development payments are normally scheduled in advance, based on attaining development milestones.
 
Raw Materials and Finished Goods Suppliers
 
Our use of raw materials in the production process consists of using pharmaceutical chemicals in various forms that are generally available from several sources.  FDA approval is required in connection with the process of using active ingredient suppliers.  In addition to the raw materials we purchase for the production process, we purchase certain finished dosage inventories.  We sell these finished dosage form products directly to our customers along with the finished dosage form products manufactured in-house.  We generally take precautionary measures to avoid a disruption in raw materials and finished goods, such as finding secondary suppliers for certain raw materials or finished goods when available.
 
The Companys primary finished goods inventory supplier is JSP, in Bohemia, New York.  Purchases of finished goods from JSP accounted for 36% of our inventory purchases in fiscal year 2017, 52% in fiscal year 2016 and 68% in fiscal year 2015.  On March 23, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with JSP for the exclusive distribution rights in the United States to the current line of JSP products, in exchange for 4.0 million shares of the Companys common stock.  The JSP products covered under the agreement included Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine with Codeine Phosphate Capsules; Digoxin Tablets; and Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, sold generically and under the brand-name Unithroid®.  On August 19, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with JSP to extend its initial contract to continue as the exclusive distributor in the United States of three JSP products: Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine with Codeine Phosphate Capsules USP; Digoxin Tablets USP; and Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets USP. The amendment to the original agreement extends the initial contract, which was due to expire on March 22, 2014, for five years through March 23, 2019.  In connection with the amendment, the Company issued a total of 1.5 million shares of the Companys common stock to JSP and its designees.  The Company recorded a $20.1 million expense in cost of sales, which represented the fair value of the shares on August 19, 2013.  If the parties agree to a second five year extension from March 23, 2019 to March 23, 2024, the Company is required to issue to JSP or its designees an additional 1.5 million shares of the Companys common stock.  Both Lannett and JSP have the right to terminate the contract if one of the parties does not cure a material breach of the contract within thirty (30) days of notice from the non-breaching party.
 
During the renewal term of the JSP Distribution Agreement, the Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase minimum dollar quantities of JSP products.  There is no guarantee that the Company will continue to meet the minimum purchase requirement for Fiscal 2018 and thereafter.  If the Company does not meet the minimum purchase requirements, JSPs sole remedy is to terminate the agreement.
 
We have entered into definitive supply and development agreements with JSP, Summit Bioscience LLC, HEC Pharm Group, Pharma Pass II LLC and various other international and domestic companies.  The Company is currently in negotiations on similar agreements with other companies and is actively seeking additional strategic partnerships, through which it will market and distribute products manufactured in-house or by third parties.  The Company plans to continue evaluating potential merger and acquisition opportunities as well as product acquisitions that are a strategic fit and accretive to the business.
 
Customers and Marketing
 
We sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors, generic drug distributors, mail-order pharmacies, group purchasing organizations, chain drug stores and other pharmaceutical companies.  The pharmaceutical industrys largest wholesale distributors, Amerisource Bergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health, accounted for 28%, 21% and 6%, respectively, of our total net sales in fiscal year 2017 and 25%, 16% and 7%, respectively, of our total net sales in fiscal year 2016.  Our largest chain drug store customer accounted for 5% of total net sales in fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016.
 
Sales to wholesale customers include indirect sales, which represent sales to third-party entities, such as independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and group purchasing organizations, collectively referred to as indirect customers.  
 
13




We enter into definitive agreements with our indirect customers to establish pricing for certain covered products.  Under such agreements, the indirect customers independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these agreed-upon prices.  We will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed-upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesalers invoice price.  This credit is called a chargeback.  For more information on chargebacks, see the section entitled Critical Accounting Policies in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.  These indirect sale transactions are recorded on our books as sales to wholesale customers.
 
We promote our products through direct sales, trade shows and group purchasing organizations bidding processes.  We also market our products through private label arrangements, under which we manufacture our products with a label containing the name and logo of our customer.  This practice is commonly referred to as private label.  Private label allows us to leverage our internal sales efforts by using the marketing services from other well-respected pharmaceutical competitors.  The focus of our sales efforts is the relationships we create with our customer accounts.
 
Strong and dependable customer relationships have created a positive platform for us to increase our sales volumes.  Historically and in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, our advertising expenses were immaterial.  When our sales representatives make contact with a customer, we will generally offer to supply the customer our products at fixed prices.  If accepted, the customers purchasing department will coordinate the purchase, receipt and distribution of the products throughout its distribution centers and retail outlets.  Once a customer accepts our supply of a product, the customer typically expects a high standard of service, including timely receipt of products ordered, availability of convenient, user-friendly and effective customer service functions and maintaining open lines of communication.
 
We believe that retail-level consumer demand dictates the total volume of sales for various products.  In the event that wholesale and retail customers adjust their purchasing volumes, we believe that consumer demand will be fulfilled by other wholesale or retail sources of supply.  As a result, we attempt to develop and maintain strong relationships with most of the major retail chains, wholesale distributors and mail-order pharmacies in order to facilitate the supply of our products through whatever channel the consumer prefers.  Although we have agreements with customers governing the transaction terms of our sales, generally there are no minimum purchase quantities applicable to these agreements.
 
Competition
 
The manufacturing and distribution of generic pharmaceutical products is a highly competitive industry.  Competition is based primarily on price.  In addition to competitive pricing, our competitive advantages are our ability to provide strong and dependable customer service by maintaining adequate inventory levels, employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of orders.  We ensure that our products are available from national wholesale, chain drug and mail-order suppliers as well as our own warehouse.  The modernization of our facilities, hiring of experienced staff and implementation of inventory and quality control programs have improved our competitive cost position.

Government Regulation
 
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, principally by the FDA and, in cases of controlled substance products the DEA and to a lesser extent by other federal regulatory bodies and state governments.  The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), the Controlled Substance Act (the CSA) and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, pricing, advertising and promotion of our generic drug products.  Non-compliance with applicable regulations can result in fines, product recalls and seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, personal and/or corporate prosecution and debarment and refusal of the government to approve new drug applications.  The FDA also has the authority to revoke previously approved drug applications after a hearing.
 
Generally, FDA approval is required before a prescription drug can be marketed.  A new drug is one not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe and effective for its intended use.  New drugs are typically developed and submitted to the FDA by companies expecting to brand the product and sell it.  The FDA review process for new drugs is very extensive and requires a substantial investment to research and test the drug candidate.  However, less burdensome approval procedures are generally used for generic equivalents.  Typically, the investment required to develop a generic drug is less costly than the innovator drug.
 
There are currently three ways to obtain FDA approval of a drug:
 
·                  New Drug Applications (NDA): Unless one of the two procedures discussed in the following sections is available, a manufacturer must conduct and submit to the FDA complete clinical studies to establish a drugs safety and efficacy.  The new drug approval process generally involves:
 
·                  completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing in compliance with the FDAs GLP regulations;
 
·                  submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 
·                  performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
 
15




·                  satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDAs cGMP regulations; and
 
·                  submission to and approval by the FDA of an NDA.
 
The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.  Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent Institutional Review Board.  Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.  These phases generally include:
 
·                  Phase I, during which the drug is introduced into healthy human subjects or, on occasion, patients and is tested for safety, stability, dose tolerance and metabolism;
 
·                  Phase II, during which the drug is introduced into a limited patient population to determine the efficacy of the product in specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and
 
·                  Phase III, during which the clinical trial is expanded to a larger and more diverse patient group at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to further evaluate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety.
 
The drug sponsor, the FDA, or the independent Institutional Review Board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
The results of preclinical animal studies and human clinical studies, together with other detailed information, are submitted to the FDA as part of the NDA.  The NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information.  The FDA may disapprove the NDA if applicable FDA regulatory criteria are not satisfied or it may require additional clinical data.  Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-market regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur or are identified after the product reaches the marketplace.  In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 
The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and withdraw approvals.
 
Satisfaction of FDA new drug approval requirements typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.  Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and/or require additional procedures which increase manufacturing costs.  Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials.  Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval.  Even if a product receives regulatory approval, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
·                  Abbreviated New Drug Applications: An ANDA is similar to an NDA except that the FDA generally waives the requirement of complete clinical studies of safety and efficacy.  However, it may require bioavailability and bioequivalence studies.  Bioavailability indicates the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug in the bloodstream needed to produce a therapeutic effect.  Bioequivalence compares one drug product with another and indicates if the rate of absorption and the levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body are within prescribed statistical limits to those of a previously approved drug.  Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, an ANDA may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the equivalent of an approved drug regardless of when such other drug was approved.  The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product.  A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition.  However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.
 
In addition to establishing a new ANDA procedure, the Hatch-Waxman Act created statutory protections for approved brand-name drugs.  Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, an ANDA for a generic drug may not be made effective until all relevant product and use patents for the brand-name drug have expired or have been determined to be invalid.  Prior to this act, the FDA gave no consideration to the patent status of a previously approved drug.  
 
16




Upon NDA approval, the FDA lists in its Orange Book the approved drug product and any patents identified by the NDA applicant that relate to the drug product.  Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the FDAs Orange Book before expiration of the referenced patent(s), must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the ANDA has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the ANDA is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification.  A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA refers.  Before the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the MMA), which amended the Hatch-Waxman Act, if the NDA holder or patent owner(s) asserted a patent challenge within 45 days of its receipt of the certification notice, the FDA was prevented from approving that ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in an ANDA applicants favor, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay.  In some cases, NDA owners and patent holders have obtained additional patents for their products after an ANDA had been filed but before that ANDA received final marketing approval and then initiated a new patent challenge, which resulted in more than one 30-month stay.  The MMA amended the Hatch-Waxman Act to eliminate certain unfair advantages of patent holders in the implementation of the Hatch-Waxman Act.  As a result, the NDA owner remains entitled to an automatic 30-month stay if it initiates a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of its receipt of notice of a paragraph IV certification, but only if the patent infringement lawsuit is directed to patents that were listed in the FDAs Orange Book before the ANDA was filed.  An ANDA applicant is now permitted to take legal action to enjoin or prohibit the listing of certain of these patents as a counterclaim in response to a claim by the NDA owner that its patent covers its approved drug product.
 
As of June 30, 2017, we have 9 paragraph IV certifications pending with the FDA.  Three of the P-IV certifications are currently being challenged.  In response to our P-IV certification with respect to the Zomig® nasal spray product, AstraZeneca AB, AstraZeneca UK Limited and Impax Laboratories, Inc. filed two patent infringement complaints against the Company in July 2014.  In response to our P-IV certification with respect to Thalomid®, Celgene Corporation and Childrens Medical Center Corporation filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Company in January 2015.  In response to our P-IV certification with respect to Suprep®, Braintree Laboratories, Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Company in March 2017.  Refer to Note 12 Legal, Regulatory Matters and Contingencies for further information on the current status of the aforementioned P-IV challenges.
 
If an ANDA applicant is the first-to-file a substantially complete ANDA with a paragraph IV certification and provides appropriate notice to the FDA, the NDA holder and all patent owner(s) for a particular generic product, the applicant may be awarded a 180-day period of marketing exclusivity against other companies that subsequently file ANDAs for that same product.  A substantially complete ANDA is one that contains all the information required by the Hatch-Waxman Act and the FDAs regulations, including the results of any required bioequivalence studies.  The FDA may refuse to accept the filing of an ANDA that is not substantially complete or may determine during substantive review of the ANDA that additional information, such as an additional bioequivalence study, is required to support approval.
 
Such a determination may affect an applicants first-to-file status and eligibility for a 180-day period of marketing exclusivity for the generic product.  The MMA also modified the rules governing when the 180-day marketing exclusivity period is triggered or forfeited and shared.  Prior to the legislation, the 180-day marketing exclusivity period was triggered upon the first commercial marketing of the ANDA or a court decision holding the patent invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed.  For ANDAs accepted for filing before March 2000, that court decision had to be final and non-appealable (other than a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari).  In March 2000, the FDA changed its position in response to two court cases that challenged the FDAs original interpretation of what constituted a court decision under the Hatch-Waxman Act.  Under the changed policy, the 180-day marketing exclusivity period began running immediately upon a district court decision holding the patent at issue invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, regardless of whether the ANDA had been approved and the generic product had been marketed.  In codifying the FDAs original policy, the MMA retroactively applies a final and non-appealable court decision trigger for all ANDAs filed before December 8, 2003 leaving intact the first commercial marketing trigger.  As for ANDAs filed after December 8, 2003, the marketing exclusivity period is only triggered upon the first commercial marketing of the ANDA product, but that exclusivity may be forfeited under certain circumstances, including, if the ANDA is not marketed within 75 days after a final and non-appealable court decision by the first-to-file or other ANDA applicant, or if the FDA does not tentatively approve the first-to-file applicants ANDA within 30 months.
 
In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent market exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA.  If the listed drug is a new chemical entity (NCE), the FDA may not accept an ANDA for a bioequivalent product for up to five years following approval of the NDA for the NCE.

If the listed drug is not a new chemical entity but the holder of the NDA conducted clinical trials essential to approval of the NDA or a supplement thereto, the FDA may not approve an ANDA for a bioequivalent product before expiration of three years.  Certain other periods of exclusivity may be available if the listed drug is indicated for treatment of a rare disease or is studied for pediatric indications.
 
·                  Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications: For a drug that is identical to a previously approved drug, a prospective manufacturer need not go through the full NDA procedure.  Instead, it may demonstrate safety and efficacy by relying on published literature and reports where at least some of information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.  The Hatch-Waxman Act permits the applicant to rely upon certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product.  The manufacturer must also submit, if the FDA so requires, bioavailability or bioequivalence data illustrating that the generic drug formulation produces the same effects, within an acceptable range, as the previously approved innovator drug.  Because published literature to support the safety and efficacy of post-1962 drugs may not be available, this procedure is of limited utility to generic drug manufacturers and the resulting approved product will not be interchangeable with the innovator drug as an ANDA drug would be unless bioequivalency testing were undertaken and approved by FDA.  Moreover, the utility of Section 505(b)(2) applications have with the exception of Grandfathered drugs  been diminished by the availability of the ANDA process, as described above.
 
Additionally, certain products marketed prior to the FDCA may be considered GRASE (Generally Recognized As Safe and Effective) or Grandfathered.  GRASE products are those old drugs that do not require prior approval from FDA in order to be marketed because they are generally recognized as safe and effective based on published scientific literature.  Similarly, Grandfathered products are those which entered the market before the passage of the 1938 act or the 1962 amendments to the act.  Under the grandfather clause, such a product is exempted from the effectiveness requirements [of the act] if its composition and labeling have not changed since 1962 and if, on the day before the 1962 amendments became effective, it was (1) used or sold commercially in the United States, (2) not a new drug as defined by the act at that time and (3) not covered by an effective application.
 
Manufacturing cGMP Requirements
 
Among the requirements for a new drug approval, a companys manufacturing methods must conform to FDA cGMP regulations before a facility may be used to manufacture a product.  The FDA performs pre-approval inspections to assess a companys manufacturing methods as part of a new drug approval process.  These inspections include reviews of procedures and operations used in the manufacture and testing of our products to assess compliance with application regulations.  The cGMP regulations must be followed at all times during which the approved drug is manufactured and the manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other authorities.  FDAs cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation.  In complying with the standards set forth in the cGMP regulations, we must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance.
 
Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including but not limited to, the seizure or recall of non-complying drug products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and/or civil and criminal penalties.  Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling changes or in product removal.  Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval.
 
Other Regulatory Requirements
 
With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.  The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FDCA and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA and state and/or federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.
 
We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research.  In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and withdraw approvals.

Any one or a combination of FDA regulatory or enforcement actions against the Company could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
 
DEA Regulation
 
We maintain registrations with the DEA that enable us to receive, manufacture, store and distribute controlled substances in connection with our operations.  Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the CSA.  The CSA governs, among other things, the distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances.  We are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess our ongoing compliance with the DEAs regulations.  Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation or a denial of renewal of our DEA registration, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and state legislatures have enacted and actively enforce, a number of laws whose purpose is to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal health care programs.  Our business is subject to compliance with these laws, such as Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Dodd-Frank and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).
Anti-Kickback Statutes, Sunshine Act and Federal False Claims Act
 
The federal health care programs fraud and abuse law (sometimes referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statue) prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid.  The definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments.  Several courts have interpreted the statutes intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the statute has been violated.  Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs.  In addition, some kickback allegations have been claimed to violate the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below.
 
The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry.  Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) to issue a series of regulations, known as safe harbors.  These safe harbors, issued by the OIG beginning in July 1991, set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute.  The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued.
 
However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as OIG.
 
Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute.  Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for health care items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 
Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on marketing of health care services and products, among other activities and recently have brought cases against companies and certain sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business.
 
Another development affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the Federal False Claims Act (FFCA) and in particular, action brought pursuant to the FFCAs Whistleblower or Qui Tam provisions.  The FFCA imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program.  The Qui Tam provisions of the FFCA allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery.  In recent years, the number of suits brought against health care providers by private individuals has increased dramatically.  In addition, various states have enacted false claims law analogous to the FFCA, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal health care program.
 
19




When an entity is determined to have violated the FFCA, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties.  Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits or causes another to submit a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government.  The federal government has used the FFCA to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals and improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, in addition to the more predictable allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered.  In addition, the federal government has prosecuted companies under the FFCA in connection with off-label promotion of products.  Our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesale or estimated retail prices of our products, the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our products and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.  We are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the FFCA or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions.  However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance.
 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (FCPA), was enacted for the purpose of making it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.  Specifically, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit the bribery of government officials.
 
HIPAA and Other Fraud and Privacy Regulations
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created two new federal crimes: health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters.  The HIPAA health care fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowing and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors.  A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion from government-sponsored programs.  The HIPAA false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services.  A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and/or imprisonment.
 
Pricing
 
In the United States, our sales are dependent upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including federal and state programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and private organizations such as commercial health insurance and managed care companies.  Such third-party payors increasingly challenge the price of medical products and services and instituting cost containment measures to control or significantly influence the purchase of medical products and services.
 
Over the past several years, the rising costs of providing health care services has triggered legislation to make certain changes to the way in which pharmaceuticals are covered and reimbursed, particularly by government programs.  For instance, recent federal legislation and regulations have created a voluntary prescription drug benefit, Medicare Part D, which revised the formula used to reimburse health care providers and physicians under Medicare Part B and imposed significant revisions to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.  These changes have resulted in and may continue to result in, coverage and reimbursement restrictions and increased rebate obligations by manufacturers.
 
In addition, there continues to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of health care.  Examples of how limits on drug coverage and reimbursement in the United States may cause reduced payments for drugs in the future include:
 
·                  changing Medicare reimbursement methodologies;
 
·                  revising drug rebate calculations under the Medicaid program;
 
·                  reforming drug importation laws;
 
·                  fluctuating decisions on which drugs to include in formularies; and
 
·                  requiring pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies.
 
20




We cannot predict the likelihood or pace of such additional changes or whether there will be significant legislative or regulatory reform impacting our products, nor can we predict with precision what effect such governmental measures would have if they were ultimately enacted into law.  However, in general, we believe that legislative and regulatory reform activity likely will continue.
 
Current or future federal or state laws and regulations may influence the prices of drugs and, therefore, could adversely affect the prices that we receive for our products. Programs in existence in certain states seek to set prices of all drugs sold within those states through the regulation and administration of the sale of prescription drugs. Expansion of these programs, in particular, state Medicaid programs, or changes required in the way in which Medicaid rebates are calculated under such programs, could adversely affect the price we receive for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, generic pharmaceutical drug prices have been the focus of increased scrutiny by certain states attorney generals, the U.S. Department of Justice and Congress. Decreases in health care reimbursements or prices of our prescription drugs could limit our ability to sell our products or decrease our revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
The Company believes that under the current regulatory environment, the generic pharmaceutical industry as a whole will be the target of increased governmental scrutiny, especially with respect to state and federal anti-trust and price fixing claims.
 
In July 2014, the Company and at least one of its competitors each received a subpoena and interrogatories from the Connecticut Attorney Generals Office concerning its investigation into the pricing of Digoxin.  In June 2016, the Connecticut Attorney General issued interrogatories and a subpoena to an employee of the Company.  The Company maintains that it acted in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and continues to cooperate with the Connecticut Attorney Generals investigation.
 
In Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, the Company and certain affiliated individuals each were served with a grand jury subpoena relating to a federal investigation of the generic pharmaceutical industry into possible violations of the Sherman Act. The subpoenas request corporate documents of the Company relating to corporate, financial and employee information, communications or correspondence with competitors regarding the sale of generic prescription medications and the marketing, sale, or pricing of certain products, generally for the period of 2005 through the dates of the subpoenas.  Based on reviews performed to date by outside counsel, the Company currently believes that it has acted in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and continues to cooperate with the federal investigation.
 
EPA Violation Notice
 
On July 13, 2017, the United States Department of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sent a Finding of Violation to KUPI alleging several violations of national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants at KUPIs Seymour, Indiana facility.  The EPA is giving the company the opportunity to discuss the matter with the agency before filing a formal complaint or assessing fines with respect to the alleged violations.  The Company is conducting an investigation into the matter and cannot reasonably predict the outcome of any potential EPA action at this time.
Other Applicable Laws
 
We are also subject to federal, state and local laws of general applicability, including laws regulating working conditions and the storage, transportation, or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances, hazardous waste, or environmental contaminants.  We monitor our compliance with laws and we believe we are in substantial compliance with all regulatory bodies.
 
As a publicly-traded company, we are also subject to significant regulations and laws, included in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Since its enactment, we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices and we continue to update the program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements.
 
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2017, we had 1,126 employees.
