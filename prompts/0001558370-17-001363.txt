 Item 1. Business
     Genesis Healthcare, Inc. (Genesis) is a holding company with subsidiaries that, on a combined basis, comprise one of the nation's largest post-acute care providers.  As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company,” and similar terms, refer collectively to Genesis and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.  We offer inpatient services through our network of skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities.  We also supply rehabilitation and respiratory therapy in approximately 1,700 locations in 45 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2016.  In addition, we provide a full complement of administrative and consultative services to our affiliated operators through our administrative services subsidiary and to third-party operators with whom we contract through our management services subsidiary. There were 42 facilities subject to such management services agreements with unaffiliated or jointly owned skilled nursing facility operators as of as of December 31, 2016. All of our healthcare operating subsidiaries focus on providing quality care to the people we serve, and our skilled nursing facility subsidiaries, which comprise the largest portion of our consolidated business, have a strong commitment to treating patients who require a high level of skilled nursing care and extensive rehabilitation therapy, whom we refer to as high-acuity patients.     Operations
 As of December 31, 2016, we offered inpatient services through our network of 499 skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities across 34 states, consisting of 473 skilled nursing facilities and 26 stand-alone assisted/senior living facilities. Of the 499 facilities, 393 are leased, 64 are owned, 36 are managed and six are joint ventures. Collectively, these skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities have 59,991 licensed beds, approximately 64% of which are concentrated in the states of California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia. We also own five skilled nursing facilities in California that we lease to an unaffiliated third party operator. See Item 2. “Properties” for the full count of facilities by state.  Our skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities are generally clustered in large urban or suburban markets. We leased 79% of our facilities as of December 31, 2016.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated approximately 83% of our revenue from our skilled nursing facilities. The remainder of our revenue is generated from our assisted/senior living services, rehabilitation therapy services provided to third-party facilities, and other ancillary services.

 Our services focus primarily on the medical and physical issues facing elderly patients and are provided by our skilled nursing facilities, assisted/senior living communities, integrated and third-party rehabilitation therapy business, and other ancillary services. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had three reportable operating segments: (1) inpatient services, which includes the operation of skilled nursing facilities and assisted/senior living facilities and is the largest portion of our business; (2) rehabilitation therapy services, which includes our integrated and third-party rehabilitation and respiratory therapy services; and (3) all other services. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the inpatient services segment generated approximately 86% of our revenue, the rehabilitation therapy services segment generated approximately 12% of our revenue and all other services accounted for the balance of our revenue. For additional information regarding the financial performance of our reportable operating segments, see Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 6, "Segment Information,"” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 Inpatient Services Segment
 Skilled Nursing Facilities
 As of December 31, 2016, our skilled nursing facilities provided skilled nursing care at 473 regionally clustered facilities, having 56,357 licensed beds, in 34 states.  We have developed programs for, and actively market our services to, high-acuity patients who are typically admitted to our facilities as they recover from strokes, other neurological conditions, cardiovascular and respiratory ailments, joint replacements and other muscular or skeletal disorders. 
 We use interdisciplinary teams of experienced medical professionals to provide services prescribed by physicians. These teams include registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, certified nursing assistants and other professionals who provide individualized comprehensive nursing care. Many of our skilled nursing facilities are equipped to provide specialty care, such as on-site dialysis, ventilator care, cardiac and pulmonary management. We also provide standard services to each of our skilled nursing patients, including room and board, special nutritional programs, social services, recreational activities and related healthcare and other services.
 Our PowerBack Rehabilitation branded facilities are designed to provide short-stay skilled nursing facilities which deliver a comprehensive rehabilitation regimen in accommodations specifically designed to serve high-acuity patients. We believe that having PowerBack Rehabilitation facilities enables us to more effectively serve higher acuity patients and achieve a higher skilled mix than a traditional hybrid skilled nursing facility, which in turn results in higher reimbursement rates. Skilled mix is the average daily number of Medicare and insurance patients we serve at our skilled nursing facilities divided by the average daily number of total patients we serve at our skilled nursing facilities.  Insurance as a payor source includes both traditional commercial insurance programs as well as managed care plans, including Medicare Advantage plans.  As of December 31, 2016, we operated 10 PowerBack Rehabilitation facilities with 997 beds. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we have 42 facilities subject to management agreements with unaffiliated or jointly owned skilled nursing facility operators. The income associated with the management services provided to the third-party facility operator is included in inpatient services in our segment reporting as services are performed primarily by personnel supporting the inpatient services segment. 
 Our administrative service company provides a full complement of administrative and consultative services to our affiliated operators to allow them to better focus on the delivery of healthcare services.
 Assisted/Senior Living Facilities
 We complement our skilled nursing care business by providing assisted/senior living services at 26 stand-alone facilities with 2,182 beds and offer an additional 1,452 assisted/senior living beds within our skilled nursing facilities as of December 31, 2016. Our assisted/senior living facilities provide residential accommodations, activities, meals, security, housekeeping and assistance in the activities of daily living to seniors who are independent or who require some support, but not the level of nursing care provided in a skilled nursing facility.  Rehabilitation Therapy Services
 As of December 31, 2016, we provided rehabilitation therapy services, including speech-language pathology (SLP), physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and respiratory therapy, to approximately 1,700 healthcare 

 
  2

 
locations in 45 states and the District of Columbia, including 461 facilities operated by us. We provide rehabilitation therapy services at our skilled nursing facilities and assisted/senior living facilities as part of an integrated service offering in connection with our skilled nursing care.  We believe that an integrated approach to treating high-acuity patients enhances our ability to achieve successful patient outcomes and enables us to identify and treat patients who can benefit from our rehabilitation therapy services. We believe hospitals and physician groups often refer high-acuity patients to our skilled nursing facilities because they recognize the value of an integrated approach to providing skilled nursing care and rehabilitation therapy services.  
 We believe that we have also established a strong reputation as a premium provider of rehabilitation therapy services to third-party skilled nursing operators in our local markets, with a recognized ability to provide these services to high-acuity patients. Our approach to providing rehabilitation therapy services for third-party operators emphasizes quality treatment and successful clinical outcomes. In addition to our rehabilitation therapy services in the United States, we have a presence in the Chinese and Hong Kong markets with initiatives to develop a rehabilitation therapy care delivery model and other services.  The revenues generated and long-lived assets associated with this expansion are immaterial as of December 31, 2016.
 Other Services
 As of December 31, 2016, we provided an array of other specialty medical services, including physician services, staffing services, and other healthcare related services.
 Industry Trends
 Over the past several decades, dynamic changes in the healthcare market have reshaped the landscape for post-acute and long-term care support services. Demand for services has traditionally been driven by changing demographics, including age. The prevalence of disability and functional impairment is age-related. 
 Market force changes across the healthcare spectrum had realigned the capabilities and responsiveness of health providers. Payment incentives had reshaped the role of the acute care sector imposing an increased emphasis on shorter lengths of inpatient stays. This shifted the focus of rehabilitative and recuperative services to post-acute providers. Traditionally, over 35% of hospital discharges required further medical intervention. For those patients over the age of 70 years requiring follow-through care, a significant portion were discharged to the post-acute/skilled nursing sector. 
 The post-acute/skilled nursing sector had expanded clinical and rehabilitative capacities to meet this demand. Among the major changes in the delivery of long-term care services was this rising demand for short-stay/post-acute care. Skilled nursing facilities had strengthened clinical specialization delivering high intensity rehabilitation, restorative care and specialized clinical programs with emphasis on successful discharges to home- and community-based settings.   
 In addition to responding to the rehabilitative and restorative needs of patients discharged from the acute care sector, center-based programs continue to provide medical, social and specialized supportive services for those patients whose medical and functional conditions are such that they require nursing home care and protective services. Programs have been developed to provide dementia care, palliative and hospice services and long-stay home-life environments. 
 Over the last several years, the post-acute/long-term care services sector has responded to the broader trends reshaping healthcare delivery:  (i) value, (ii) cost efficiencies, (iii) measured quality and outcomes, (iv) care coordinating integration, and (v) patient/resident centered care. The post-acute care/skilled nursing and rehabilitation sectors are investing efforts and energies to demonstrate value, to strengthen care efficiencies and to develop measurable benchmarks for performance.
     Changes in post-acute and long-term care services sector include:
     Aging Demographic Trends: According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 70% of the U.S. population over the age of 65 can expect to use some form of post-acute care during their lives. While we are currently experiencing a trough in the number of people over the age of 65, demographic trends are expected to improve. Post-acute 

 
  3

 
care spending is expected to rise as the populations of people in the U.S. over the ages of 65 are expected to increase from 46 million in 2014, to 56 million in 2020 and to 98 million older persons by 2060, more than twice the number in 2014.  As the average life expectancy continues to increase and as the elderly population becomes a greater proportion of the overall U.S. population, management expects there to be an increasing demand for nursing and post-acute care.
     Supply/Demand Dynamics:  The supply of skilled nursing facilities has been decreasing, partially due to the increase in required clinical capabilities to care for higher acuity patients. In the coming years, management expects a supply and demand imbalance in the skilled nursing industry due to the continued decline in the supply of beds and the projected increase in an aging population with longer life expectancies.
     Shift of Patients to Quality Care in Cost-Effective Settings:  As a result of rising U.S. healthcare costs, government regulations and payor preferences have led to a shift in the provision of care for higher acuity patients to less costly settings. Government sponsored programs, private insurance companies and other third-party payors have recognized that treating patients requiring complex medical care in skilled nursing facilities is a cost-effective alternative to receiving treatment in an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) or long-term acute care (LTAC) hospital. This dynamic makes skilled nursing facilities an attractive provider for payors and acute care hospitals seeking cost effective quality care settings when discharging patients.  As a result, skilled nursing facilities are generally serving a larger population of higher acuity patients than in the past.
     Growth of Medicare and Medicaid Replacement Programs through Managed Care Organizations: As the expansion of Medicaid and Medicare continues, we expect migration towards managed care programs because managed Medicaid and Medicare programs improve access to coordinated healthcare services, including preventive care, and are designed to control healthcare costs.  We believe post-acute providers like ours with sufficient size and scale to provide clinically coordinated care across the entire post-acute care continuum are well positioned to obtain more referrals and become a provider of choice for these payors.
 Value-Based Care Delivery and Reimbursement Reform:  A significant goal of federal healthcare reform is to transform the delivery of healthcare by changing reimbursement for healthcare services to hold providers accountable for the cost and quality of care provided.  Medicare is implementing Value-Based Care Delivery models to focus on patient outcomes and cost containment along the entire healthcare continuum.  Accordingly, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is implementing demonstration and mandatory programs to bundle acute care and post-acute care reimbursement to hold providers accountable for costs across a broader continuum of care.  These reimbursement methodologies and similar programs are likely to continue and expand, both in public and commercial health plans. On January 26, 2015, CMS announced its goal to have up to 50% of Medicare payments for quality and value through alternative payment models such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) or bundled payments by 2018. Providers who respond successfully to these trends and are able to deliver quality care at lower cost are likely to benefit financially.
 Acquisition Opportunities:  The skilled nursing industry is large and highly fragmented, characterized predominantly by numerous local and regional providers. We believe this fragmentation provides significant acquisition opportunities for us.
     Revenue Sources
     We derive revenue primarily from the Medicaid and Medicare programs, managed care and commercial insurance payors and private pay patients.
      Medicaid
     Medicaid typically covers patients that require standard room and board services, and provides reimbursement rates that are generally lower than rates earned from other sources. Medicaid is a program financed by state funds and matching federal funds administered by the states and their political subdivisions. Medicaid programs generally provide health benefits for qualifying individuals, and may supplement Medicare benefits for persons aged 65 and older meeting financial eligibility. Medicaid reimbursement formulas are established by each state with the approval of the federal government in accordance with federal guidelines. Seniors who enter skilled nursing facilities as private pay clients can become eligible 

 
  4

 
for Medicaid once they have substantially depleted their assets. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for skilled nursing facilities.
     Reimbursement varies from state to state and is based upon a number of different systems, including cost-based, prospective payment and negotiated rate systems. Rates are subject to statutory and regulatory changes and interpretations and rulings by individual state agencies.
     During recent years, a number of states have advanced initiatives expanding managed care programs to include managing long-term care support services for Medicaid residents. Some states have focused efforts towards integrating Medicare and Medicaid delivery for individuals who are dually eligible for both programs. Across the states, there are a number of pilot initiatives underway. Most of these initiatives attempt to improve integration of delivery, strengthen care management and improve cost efficiencies. 
     Medicare
      Medicare is a federal program that provides healthcare benefits to individuals who are 65 years of age or older or are disabled. To achieve and maintain Medicare certification, a skilled nursing facility must sign a Medicare provider agreement and meet the CMS “Requirements for Participation” on an ongoing basis, as determined in periodic facility inspections or “surveys” conducted primarily by the state licensing agency in the state where the facility is located. Medicare pays for inpatient skilled nursing facility services under the prospective payment system. The prospective payment for each beneficiary is based upon the medical condition of and care needed by the beneficiary. Medicare Part A skilled nursing facility coverage is limited to 100 days per episode of illness for those beneficiaries who require daily care following discharge from an acute care hospital.  
· | Medicare Part A provides for inpatient services including hospital care, skilled nursing care, hospice and home healthcare.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Medicare Part B provides for outpatient services including physician services, diagnostic services, durable medical equipment, skilled therapy services and medical supplies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Medicare Part C is a managed care option (“Medicare Advantage”) for beneficiaries who are entitled to Part A and enrolled in Part B and are administered by commercial health insurers that contract with Medicare or Medicaid.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Medicare Part D is a benefit that provides prescription drug benefits for both Medicare and Medicare/Medicaid dual eligible patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Medicare reimburses our skilled nursing facilities under a prospective payment system (PPS) for a defined bundle of inpatient covered services. Medicare coverage criteria requires that a beneficiary spend at least three qualifying days in an inpatient acute setting before Medicare will cover the skilled nursing service. While beneficiaries are eligible for up to 100 days per spell of illness of skilled nursing care services (defined as requiring daily skilled nursing and/or skilled rehabilitation services), current law imposes a daily co-payment after the 20th day of covered services. Under a PPS, facilities are paid a predetermined amount per patient, per day, for certain services based on the anticipated costs of treating patients.  The amount to be paid is determined by classifying each patient into a resource utilization group (RUG) category that is based upon each patient's acuity level. 
     Under PPS, Medicare reimburses our skilled nursing facilities for a defined bundle of Medicare Part A services. For Medicare beneficiaries who qualify for the Medicare Part A coverage, rehabilitation services are purchased through the per diem payment. For beneficiaries who do not meet the coverage criteria for Part A services, rehabilitation services may be purchased under Medicare Part B. As discussed above, there are specific coverage and payment requirements. One of the more challenging rehabilitation requirements is that covered Part B services are limited with a payment cap by combined SLP and PT services and a separate annual cap for OT services. These caps were implemented under the authority of the Balanced Budget Amendments of 1997. On multiple occasions during the past two decades, Congress 

 
  5

 
has interceded to suspend the “therapy caps” offering an “exceptions process” so claims in excess of the annualized cap can be processed.    
     Current law requires CMS to calculate an annual market basket update to the payment rates. Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) directed the agency to reduce that payment level by a calculated multi-factor productivity adjustment. The agency also retains the authority to review and adjust payments for corrections to previous year market baskets where over/under payment exceeded 0.05% between the projected market basket and the actual performance. Annually, on a federal fiscal year basis (October 1), the agency makes its payment changes. Normally CMS issues proposed rules during April providing 60-days for stakeholder input, and issues finalized rules 60 days prior to the start of the fiscal year. If there are no substantive changes in rules and regulations, the agency has the authority to issue rate adjustments in a notice, rather than a proposed rule. The notice must be issued 60 days before the beginning of the fiscal year.
     Congress has the authority to change the law governing how all providers, including skilled nursing providers, are reimbursed, and the criteria and conditions for coverage. For example, under the Budget Control Act of 201l, Congress authorized a 2% sequestration on Medicare payments to most providers. Subsequent actions by Congress extended sequestration through 2023. Indeed, during the past two years, Congress has enacted several new laws that impact how skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed under Medicare. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) of 2014 established a skilled nursing facility Value-Based Incentive/Penalty program based on hospital readmissions. The fiscal year 2016 final skilled nursing facilities PPS rules set forth the criteria for this program to be implemented by 2019.  The IMPACT (Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation) Act of 2014 establishes an aggressive time-line for standardized patient assessment for post-acute providers, including skilled nursing facilities. CMS has been engaging stakeholders in developing implementation instructions. 
     CMS issued new guidelines on July 30, 2015, published in the Federal Register on August 4, 2015, which included new quality reporting requirements and instructions for establishing a value-based purchasing incentive program based on hospital-readmissions performance. CMS has not indicated whether there will be skilled nursing facility PPS rule-making for fiscal year 2017. The agency is expected to provide additional guidance regarding implementation of the IMPACT Act. 
     The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 extended the therapy exceptions process but added a second tier cap mandating Medical Manual Review for claims submitted that exceeded $3,700 for PT and SLP services combined and another threshold of $3,700 for OT services.  The Medicare Access & CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which authorized payment reforms for physicians and other professional services, including the three rehabilitative therapies, included provisions not only stabilizing the professional fee schedules, but also extending the therapy cap exceptions process through December 31, 2017. 
     In addition to setting the payment rules for skilled nursing facility services, CMS annually adjusts its payment rules for other post-acute services including inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-stay inpatient hospitals, home health agencies and hospice services. It is important to understand the Medicare program and its reimbursement rates and rules are subject to frequent change. These include statutory and regulatory changes, rate adjustments (including retroactive adjustments), administrative or executive orders and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially adversely affect the rates at which Medicare reimburses us for our services.  Budget pressures often lead the federal government to reduce or place limits on reimbursement rates under Medicare. Implementation of these and other types of measures has in the past, and could in the future, result in substantial reductions in our revenue and operating margins.

 Managed Care and Commercial Insurance
     Managed care patients are insured by certain third-party entities, typically a senior HMO plan, or who are Medicare beneficiaries who have assigned their Medicare benefits to a Medicare Advantage HMO plan. Another type of insurance, long-term care insurance, is also becoming more widely available to consumers, but is not expected to contribute significantly to industry revenues in the near term.     Private and Other Payors
     Private and other payors consist primarily of individuals, family members or other third parties who directly pay for the services we provide.
     Reimbursement for our Services
     Reimbursement for Skilled Nursing Facilities
     The majority of skilled nursing facility revenues in the U.S. come from Medicare and Medicaid, with the remainder of revenues derived from managed care and commercial insurance, other third-party sources and private pay.  Typically, all patients that enter a skilled nursing facility begin as a short-term acute care patient and either get discharged, or become long-term care residents.  After a patient no longer qualifies for skilled care under Medicare, the reimbursement of costs incurred by a skilled nursing facility patient will be shifted to private pay (out of pocket) resources and then Medicaid if the patient qualifies.    Historically, adjustments to reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid have had a significant effect on our revenue and results of operations.  Recently enacted, pending and proposed legislation and administrative rulemaking at the federal and state levels could have similar effects on our business.  Efforts to impose reduced reimbursement rates, greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, any delay or default by the federal or state governments in making Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement payments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Reimbursement for Assisted/Senior Living Facilities
     Assisted/senior living facilities generate revenues primarily from private pay sources, including third-party insurance and self pay, with only a small portion derived from government sources.
     Reimbursement for Rehabilitation Services
     Outside of therapy received during a Medicare Part A covered stay of up to 100 days, most of our rehabilitation therapy services are typically reimbursed under the Medicare Part B program. The payments made to our rehabilitation therapy services segment for services it provides to skilled nursing facilities are determined by negotiated patient per diem rates or a negotiated fee schedule based on the type of service rendered. In addition, this segment is also directly reimbursed from the Medicare Part B program and other insurance companies through its certified outpatient rehabilitation agencies and group practices for services provided in assisted living facilities, homes and the community.  Recent Regulatory and other Governmental Actions Affecting Revenue
     Skilled Nursing Facilities
     Healthcare Reform Initiatives
     We believe we are transforming our business and operations for success in a post-healthcare reform environment.  As healthcare reform continues to be implemented, we believe post-acute healthcare providers who provide quality diversified care, have density and strong reputations in local markets, have good relationships with acute care hospitals

and payors and operate with scale will have a competitive advantage in an episodic payment environment.  We believe our organic and strategic growth strategies should position us to become a valuable partner to acute care hospitals and managed care organizations that are seeking to increase care coordination, reduce lengths of stay and hospital readmissions, more effectively manage healthcare costs and develop new care delivery and payment models.
     As the industry and its regulators engage in this new environment, we are positioning ourselves to adapt to changes that are ultimately made to the delivery system:
    
· | Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) – Effective January 1, 2016, we entered Genesis Physician Services (GPS), our physician services subsidiary, into the MSSP. While beneficiary attribution is retrospective, preliminary data show that we are managing approximately 15,000 Medicare fee for service beneficiaries with annualized Medicare spending of more than $800 million. These numbers are subject to modification and will not be reconciled by the CMS until mid-2017. Successful participation requires us to save at least approximately three percent of the total Medicare spend under management in order to share in up to 50 percent of the savings with CMS predicated upon achieving certain quality initiatives. Once the savings hurdle has been reached, Genesis begins sharing based on the first dollar of savings. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) – Participation success is determined retrospectively given the lack of available historical data around the bundles, however, we have received four quarterly reconciliations in 2016 representing the last three fiscal quarters of 2015 and the first quarter in 2016. The reconciliations for these four fiscal quarters netted a positive $3.8 million. In addition, we received the reconciliation for the second quarter of 2016 in January 2017 which netted a positive $1.9 million. Cumulatively, the five quarters of reconciled data provide the necessary historical data, combined with our current period data, to accrue the third and fourth quarters of 2016 as a net positive of $4.3 million for both quarters. Based on the BPCI quarterly reconciliations, accumulated historical data and current data, we have recorded a net positive amount of $10.0 million in 2016. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) – The CJR model focuses on coordinated, patient-centered care. Under this model, the hospital in which the hip or knee replacement takes place would be accountable for the costs and quality of care from the time of the surgery through 90 days after an “episode” of care. On April 1, 2016, the CJR Program went into effect in 67 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) throughout the country. We have approximately 100 facilities in 22 of those MSAs. While the program was recently enacted, we have already experienced a significant decline from this class of diagnosis-related groups from recent years primarily due to the proliferation of ACOs and the BPCI program resulting from the PPACA.

· | Vitality to You – We continue to make great progress with our new Vitality to You service offering which brings medically necessary outpatient rehab therapy services directly to patients in the home and community. In 2016, Vitality to You saw revenue expand by 132% as compared to 2015. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Medicare Rate Increase
     On July 29, 2016, CMS issued a final rule for fiscal year 2017 outlining a net increase of 2.4% to Medicare reimbursement rates for skilled nursing facilities attributable to a 2.7% market basket increase, reduced by a 0.3% multi-factor productivity adjustment required by law.  The final rule continues the shift to move the Medicare program, and the health care system at large, toward paying providers based on the quality, rather than the quantity, of care.  The final rule also further defines and notes changes in consolidated billing for skilled nursing facilities for fiscal year 2017 (which began October 1, 2016); the Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program; the quality reporting program and the payments models research.   
     Effective October 1, 2017, the fiscal year 2018 market basket will be limited to a 1% increase.
     On July 30, 2015, CMS issued its final rule outlining fiscal year 2016 Medicare payment rates for skilled nursing facilities. CMS estimated that aggregate payments to skilled nursing facilities would increase by 1.2% for fiscal year 2016 (which began October 1, 2015). This estimated increase reflected a 2.3% market basket increase, reduced by a 

 
  8

 
0.6% forecast error adjustment and further reduced by a 0.5% multi-factor productivity adjustment required by the PPACA. This final rule also identified a new skilled nursing facility VBP and an all-cause all-condition hospital readmission measure.
 On July 31, 2014, CMS issued its final rule providing for, among other things, a net increase of 2.0% in PPS payments to skilled nursing facilities for CMS fiscal year 2015 (which began October 1, 2014) as compared to the PPS payments in CMS fiscal year 2014 (which ended September 30, 2014).  The 2.0% increase is on a net basis, after the application of a 2.5% market basket increase reduced by a 0.5% multi-factor productivity adjustment required by the PPACA. There was no forecast error adjustment.
     Episode Payment Models (EPM)
     On January 3, 2017, CMS issued its final rule implementing three new Medicare Parts A and B episode payment models and implements changes to the existing CJR model. Under the three new episode payment models, acute care hospitals in certain selected geographic areas will participate in retrospective episode payment models targeting care for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries receiving services during acute myocardial infarction (AMI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and surgical hip/femur fracture treatment (SHFFT) episodes. AMI and CABG episodes will be tested in 98 MSAs and SHFFT episodes will be tested in the current 67 MSAs participating in CJR.  The SHFFT payment model will support clinicians in providing care to patients who received surgery after a hip fracture, other than hip replacement.  All related care within 90 days of hospital discharge will be included in the episode of care. Hospitals may share in risk and savings with other providers, including skilled nursing facilities. The provisions contained in the instructions become effective July 1, 2017.     Civil Monetary Penalties (CMP)
     On November 2, 2015, the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (the 2015 Act) became law. Prior to 2015, CMPs authorized under the Social Security Act were exempt from inflation adjustments under the law. The 2015 Act requires agencies to: 
· | Adjust the level of applicable CMPs with an initial “catch-up” adjustment, through interim final rulemaking (IFR); and,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Make subsequent annual adjustments for inflation.
--+--------------------------------------------------

      The 2015 Act provides that “catch-up” adjustments are based on the percentage change between the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the month of October in the year a CMP was originally established and the CPI-U for October 2015. Subsequent annual adjustments are based on the extent to which of the CPI-U for the month of October of a current year exceeds the CPI for the month of October of the previous year.
     These new CMP amounts apply to any CMP imposed on or after September 6, 2016 (the effective date of the IFR) for noncompliant conduct that occurred on or after November 2, 2015, regardless of when the noncompliance was identified. The IFR only affects specific CMP amounts and not any other related provisions, such as the factors reviewed for assessing CMPs for example.  
     Many of the CMPs have been unadjusted for decades.  The inflationary increase effectively doubles the cost to skilled nursing facilities for these adjusted CMPs.
     Requirements for Participation
     On October 4, 2016, CMS published a final rule to make major changes to improve the care and safety of residents in long-term care facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The policies in this final rule are targeted at reducing unnecessary hospital readmissions and infections, improving the quality of care, and strengthening safety measures for residents in these facilities.

 Changes finalized in this rule include:
    
· | Strengthening the rights of long-term care facility residents, including prohibiting the use of pre-dispute binding arbitration agreements.

· | Ensuring that long-term care facility staff members are properly trained on caring for residents with dementia and in preventing elder abuse.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ensuring that long-term care facilities take into consideration the health of residents when making decisions on the kinds and levels of staffing a facility needs to properly take care of its residents.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ensuring that staff members have the right skill sets and competencies to provide person-centered care to residents. The care plans developed for residents will take into consideration their goals of care and preferences.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improving care planning, including discharge planning for all residents with involvement of the facility’s interdisciplinary team and consideration of the caregiver’s capacity, giving residents information they need for follow-up after discharge, and ensuring that instructions are transmitted to any receiving facilities or services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Allowing dietitians and therapy providers the authority to write orders in their areas of expertise when a physician delegates the responsibility and state licensing laws allow.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Updating the long-term care facility’s infection prevention and control program, including requiring an infection prevention and control officer and an antibiotic stewardship program that includes antibiotic use protocols and a system to monitor antibiotic use.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The regulations took effect on November 28, 2016. CMS is implementing the regulations using a phased approach. The phases are as follows: 
    
· | Phase 1: The regulations included in Phase 1 were implemented November 28, 2016.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: The regulations included in Phase 2 must be implemented by November 28, 2017.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3: The regulations included in Phase 3 must be implemented by November 28, 2019.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Some regulatory sections are divided among more than one phase, and some of the more extensive new requirements have been placed in later phases to allow facilities time to successfully prepare for compliance.
     The total costs associated with implementing the new regulations are not known at this time.  Failure to comply with the new regulations could result in exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We have substantially complied with the regulations imposed through the Phase 1 implementation thus far.
     Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act (IMPACT)
     In 2014, with strong support from most stakeholders, Congress enacted the IMPACT Act. The intent of this enactment was to improve the uniformity of data reporting across the post-acute sector and to move forward with a common assessment tool rationalizing the delivery of post-acute services. The IMPACT Act requires that CMS develop and implement quality measures from five quality measure domains using standardized assessment data.  In addition, the IMPACT Act requires the development and reporting of measures pertaining to resource use, hospitalization, and discharge to the community. Through the use of standardized quality measures and standardized data, the intent of the IMPACT Act, among other obligations, is to enable interoperability and access to longitudinal information for providers to facilitate coordinated care, improved outcomes, and overall quality comparisons.
     Data collection for certain measures including pressure ulcers, falls and functional goals will be gathered quarterly beginning October 1, 2016 with a deadline to submit errors by May 15, 2017.  Failure to submit the required data will result in a 2% Medicare payment penalty beginning October 1, 2017.

 Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing Program (VBP)
      The CMS Skilled Nursing Facility VBP Program is one of many VBP programs that aims to reward quality and improve health care. Beginning October 1, 2018, skilled nursing facilities will have an opportunity to receive incentive payments based on performance on the specified quality measure.
      PAMA, enacted into law on April 1, 2014, authorized the VBP Program and requires CMS to adopt a VBP payment adjustment for skilled nursing facilities beginning October 1, 2018. By law, the VBP Program is limited to a single readmission measure at a time. 
     PAMA requires CMS to, among other things: 

· | Furnish value-based incentive payments to skilled nursing facilities for services beginning October 1, 2018.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop a methodology for assessing performance scores.
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | Adopt performance standards on a quality measure that include achievement and improvement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rank skilled nursing facilities based on their performance from low to high. The highest ranked facilities will receive the highest payments, and the facilities ranked in the bottom 40% will receive payments that are less than what they otherwise would have received without the VBP Program.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  CMS will withhold 2% of Medicare payments starting October 1, 2018, to fund the incentive payment pool and will then redistribute 50% to 70% of the withheld payments back to skilled nursing facilities through the VBP Program.  Failure to qualify for the incentive payment pool at levels that at least match the 2% withholding could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
     Texas Minimum Payment Amount Program
     We manage the operations of 20 skilled nursing facilities in the state of Texas, which we consolidate through our controlling interests in those entities through management agreements.  Those skilled nursing facilities participated in a voluntary supplemental Medicaid payment program known as the Minimum Payment Amount Program (MPAP), which expired August 31, 2016.  The purpose of MPAP funds was to continue a level of funding for participating skilled nursing facilities so that they could more readily provide quality care to Medicaid beneficiaries. While the state had been actively appealing CMS, the MPAP expired and has not been extended or replaced with a similar funding mechanism. There can be no assurances that such an extension or replacement of those supplemental funds will be reached.  On an annualized basis, MPAP provided $62 million of revenue and enhanced pre-tax income of our participating skilled nursing centers by approximately $18 million.
     Payroll-Based Journal
 One of the CMS initiatives authorized by the PPACA was to improve the accuracy of nursing home staffing data. CMS initiated and rolled-out an electronic payroll-based journal requirement effective July 1, 2016. This system allows staffing and census information to be collected on a regular and more frequent basis than previously collected. It is also auditable to ensure accuracy.  All long-term care facilities have access to this system at no cost to facilities. 
 As discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” the services we provide, the credentials of the employees providing them and the enforcement actions that post-acute nursing home and rehabilitation services are subject to are complex and constantly changing. Virtually all aspects of services provided are regulated. Survey and certification interpretive guidelines, scope of practice acts, admission, assessment and assessment requirements are rigidly enforced.  
     Rehabilitation Services
     A portion of our rehabilitation therapy service reimbursement is tied to the Medicare Part B program as outpatient therapy services. These are therapy services provided to inpatient residents of skilled nursing facilities who do not meet the rigorous criteria for Medicare Part A coverage or have exhausted their Medicare Part A coverage and patients in the community who are being serviced through Medicare certified outpatient rehabilitation agencies or group practices we 

 
  11

 
operate. These outpatient services are reimbursed under the Medicare Part B fee schedules. These fee schedules are updated annually through rule-making by CMS. 
     As part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress established annual caps, commonly referred to as therapy caps, that limit the amounts that can be paid (including deductible and coinsurance amounts) for rehabilitation therapy services rendered to any Medicare beneficiary under Medicare Part B. A specific cap was established for the combined PT and SLP services and a separate cap for OT services without applying for an exception. Under the law, these caps are indexed. In 2015 for PT and SLP services combined, the limit on incurred expenses was $1,940. In 2015 for OT services, the limit was $1,940. On October 30, 2015, CMS issued final rules for calendar year 2016 resulting in respective therapy caps increasing to $1,960.
     During the past decade and a half, Congress has intervened periodically to suspend and/or revise the cap limitations or provide an exception process. As part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Congress directed CMS to develop a process that allows exceptions for Medicare beneficiaries to therapy caps when continued therapy is deemed medically necessary. Since that enactment, Congress has extended the exceptions process to the therapy caps several times. Under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, Congress extended the exceptions process through December 31, 2017. 
     As part of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Congress instructed CMS to implement a manual medical review (MMR) process for Medicare Part B therapy claims that qualified for the exceptions process but exceeded a $3,700 threshold (combined PT/SLP services and a separate threshold of $3,700 for OT services). This process was extended as part of the PAMA. Responding to concerns that MMR was causing delays in processing claims and undue hardships, Congress as part of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 extended the MMR process through December 31, 2017, revised the statute to give CMS authority to selectively target its review process and clarified that MMRs should be applied as post-payment reviews. In February 2016, CMS issued an initial notice of how it plans to revise its application of the MMR process. 
     Federal Health Care Reform
 In addition to the matters described above affecting Medicare and Medicaid participating providers, PPACA enacted several reforms with respect to skilled nursing facilities, including payment measures to realize significant savings of federal and state funds by deterring and prosecuting fraud and abuse in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While many of the provisions of PPACA will not take effect for several years or are subject to further refinement through the promulgation of regulations, some key provisions of PPACA are presently effective.
· | Enhanced CMPs and Escrow Provisions. PPACA includes expanded CMP and related provisions applicable to all Medicare and Medicaid providers. CMS rules adopted to implement applicable provisions of PPACA also provide that assessed CMPs may be collected and placed in whole or in part into an escrow pending final disposition of the applicable administrative and judicial appeals processes. To the extent our businesses are assessed large CMPs that are collected and placed into an escrow account pending lengthy appeals, such actions could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nursing Home Transparency Requirements. In addition to expanded CMP provisions, PPACA imposes new transparency requirements for Medicare-participating nursing facilities. In addition to previously required disclosures regarding a facility's owners, management and secured creditors, PPACA expanded the required disclosures to include information regarding the facility's organizational structure, additional information on officers, directors, trustees and "managing employees" of the facility (including their names, titles, and start dates of services), and information regarding certain parties affiliated with the facility. The transparency provisions could result in the potential for greater government scrutiny and oversight of the ownership and investment structure for skilled nursing facilities, as well as more extensive disclosure of entities and individuals that comprise part of skilled nursing facilities' ownership and management structure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Suspension of Payments During Pending Fraud Investigations. PPACA provides the federal government with expanded authority to suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments if a provider is investigated for allegations or issues of fraud. This suspension authority creates a new mechanism for the federal government to suspend both Medicare and Medicaid payments for allegations of fraud, independent of whether a state exercises its authority
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  12

 

to suspend Medicaid payments pending a fraud investigation. To the extent the suspension of payments provision is applied to one of our businesses for allegations of fraud, such a suspension could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Overpayment Reporting and Repayment; Expanded False Claims Act Liability. PPACA enacted several important changes that expand potential liability under the federal False Claims Act (FCA). Overpayments related to services provided to both Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries must be reported and returned to the applicable payor within specified deadlines, or else they are considered obligations of the provider for purposes of the federal FCA. This new provision substantially tightens the repayment and reporting requirements generally associated with operations of healthcare providers to avoid FCA exposure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Home- and Community-Based Services. PPACA provides that states can provide home- and community-based attendant services and supports through the Community First Choice State plan option. States choosing to provide home- and community-based services under this option must make such services available to assist with activities of daily living and health related tasks under a plan of care agreed upon by the individual and his/her representative. PPACA also includes additional measures related to the expansion of community- and home-based services and authorizes states to expand coverage of community- and home-based services to individuals who would not otherwise be eligible for them. The expansion of home- and community-based services could reduce the demand for the facility-based services that we provide.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Health Care-Acquired Conditions. PPACA provides that the Secretary of HHS must prohibit payments to states for any amounts expended for providing medical assistance for certain medical conditions acquired during the patient's receipt of healthcare services. The CMS regulation implementing this provision of PPACA prohibits states from making payments to providers under the Medicaid program for conditions that are deemed to be reasonably preventable. It uses Medicare's list of preventable conditions in inpatient hospital settings as the base (adjusted for the differences in the Medicare and Medicaid populations) and provides states the flexibility to identify additional preventable conditions and settings for which Medicaid payment will be denied.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Value-Based Purchasing. PPACA requires the Secretary of HHS develop a plan to implement a VBP program for payments under the Medicare program for skilled nursing facilities and to submit a report containing the plan to Congress. The intent of the provision is to potentially reconfigure how Medicare pays for healthcare services, moving the program towards rewarding better value, outcomes, and innovations, instead of volume. According to the plan submitted to Congress in June 2012, the funding for the VBP program could come from payment withholds from poor-performing skilled nursing facilities or by holding back a portion of the base payment rate or the annual update for all skilled nursing facilities. The scope of the VBP program is uncertain as to the full effect it would have upon skilled nursing facilities, but its funding or other provisions could negatively affect skilled nursing facilities. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Anti-Kickback Statute Amendments. PPACA amended the Anti-Kickback Statute so that (i) a claim that includes items or services violating the Anti-Kickback Statute also would constitute a false or fraudulent claim under the federal FCA and (ii) the intent required to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute is lowered such that a person need not have actual knowledge or specific intent to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute in order for a violation to be deemed to have occurred. These modifications of the Anti-Kickback Statute could expose us to greater risk of inadvertent violations of the statute and to related liability under the federal FCA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The provisions of PPACA discussed above are examples of recently enacted federal health reform provisions that we believe may have a material impact on the long-term care industry generally and on our business. However, the foregoing discussion is not intended to constitute, nor does it constitute, an exhaustive review and discussion of PPACA. It is possible that other provisions of PPACA may be interpreted, clarified, or applied to our businesses in a way that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similar federal and/or state legislation that may be adopted in the future could have similar effects.

 Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the following competitive strengths will enable us to maintain a leading market position and continue to increase our cash flows.
 Quality Patient Care, Differentiated Clinical Capabilities and Clinical Specialization: To ensure clinical oversight and continuity of patient care, we employ physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners that are primarily involved in providing medical direction and/or direct patient care. This medical staff structure allows for significant involvement of physicians at all levels of the organization, thus ensuring that an emphasis on quality care is maintained.  In an effort to further enhance the quality of care that we provide to our patients, we have made significant investments to modernize our physical plant, expand rehabilitation gym capacity and develop clinical specialty units.  Since 2007, the number of clinical specialty units in our facilities has grown from 58 units to more than 200 units.  The addition of clinical specialty units to our facility portfolio has allowed us to better meet the needs of our patients.  These specialty units, along with our advanced capabilities in post-acute cardiac and pulmonary management, differentiate us in local areas, as competitors often do not offer these programs.  Our focus on quality patient care, differentiated clinical capabilities and clinical specialization has attracted higher acuity patients who are typically reimbursed by Medicare or managed care payors.
 Leading Post-Acute Provider: We are a leading provider of post-acute care services.  We are the largest operator of skilled nursing facilities in the U.S. and also operate the second largest post-acute rehabilitation therapy services business in the U.S.  Our size allows us to realize economies of scale, purchasing power and increased operating efficiencies that are not available to smaller operators.  Our scale also positions us to take advantage of potential acquisition opportunities in the fragmented post-acute care industry and benefit from synergies not available to many potential acquirers.  
 Strong Geographic Density in Regional Markets:  We have developed geographic density in attractive markets with 64% of our total licensed skilled nursing beds located in nine states: California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia.  Within these and other states, we seek to cluster our facilities to create a dense, localized footprint.   By clustering our facilities, we are able to provide a larger and more diverse number of clinical services within a regional market.  As a result, we are often the leading skilled nursing facility operator in many of the regional markets in which we operate, based on number of beds.  Strategically clustered facilities in single or contiguous markets also allow us to achieve lower operating costs through greater purchasing power and operating efficiencies, facilitate the development of strong relations with state and local regulators and provide us with the ability to coordinate sales and marketing strategies.  Our strong reputation and operating performance in regional markets also allows us to develop relationships with key referral sources, including hospitals and other managed care payors, which has led to an increase in the number of high-acuity patients that are referred to our facilities.  
 Experienced Management Team with Proven Operating Performance: We have an experienced management team with deep post-acute experience and a track record of growth and integration experience, providing a distinct competitive advantage in navigating the complex and evolving post-acute care industry.  Our management team has also demonstrated an ability to consummate successfully and integrate both large and small acquisitions.  
 Key Partnerships and Relationships: We have partnered with hospitals in our local markets to enhance the coordination of patient care during and after a post-acute rehabilitation stay. The goal of these relationships is to provide quality care while lowering hospital readmission rates and reducing overall healthcare costs.  Further, these relationships allow us to manage patient outcomes and coordinate care once a patient leaves the acute care setting and enters one of our facilities.  We have also forged key relationships with managed care payors to better align quality goals and reimbursement, resulting in a more coordinated care approach that reduces hospital readmissions.  As an increasing number of patients gain access to health insurance through healthcare reform or move to managed Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are poised to capture additional market share as managed care companies look to match quality patient care with a cost efficient setting. 
 Growth Strategy
 We focus on growth through various internal and external initiatives.  These initiatives include a continuation of existing core strategies and a number of newly developed strategies designed to capitalize on our competitive strengths 

 
  14

 
and position us for success in a post-healthcare reform environment.  These growth strategies can be categorized into the following key initiatives:  
 Commitment to quality care.  We are focused on qualitative and quantitative clinical performance measures in order to enhance and improve the care provided in our facilities.  We continually seek to enhance our reputation for providing clinical capabilities and favorable outcomes.  Among other things, we have and will continue to increase our professional nursing mix and integrate nurse practitioners and employed physicians into our clinical model.  We have incentivized our management team to improve clinical performance to further ensure accountability for the quality of care. 
 Capitalize on attractive demographics. With the increasing elderly population and corollary increase in life expectancy, management believes there will be increasing demand for post-acute care services.  To address this growing demand and the subsequent increase in healthcare costs, acute care providers will increasingly look to post-acute service providers with demonstrated capabilities and proven performance to play a larger role in the care of medically complex, post-acute care patients.  At the same time, both private and public payors are seeking more efficient and economic means of meeting the needs of the growing elderly demographic.  Payors prefer to shift patients away from costlier hospital and LTAC settings to skilled nursing facilities, where personalized rehabilitation and skilled nursing care can be provided at a lower cost.  To facilitate this transfer, skilled nursing facilities that can demonstrate proven clinical capabilities will be better suited to capture a greater proportion of these patients. As a leading national provider of post-acute services, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for post-acute services. 
 Focus on high-acuity patients. We will continue to differentiate our facilities to capture high-acuity patients by growing the number of clinical specialty units, expanding therapy gym capacity, developing the clinical skills of employees, developing relationships with acute care hospitals and managed care payors, and expanding the use of exclusively employed physicians.  By treating higher acuity patients, we strive to increase our skilled mix and further position ourselves for shifting demographics of our aging population.
 Grow the rehabilitation therapy segment. We expect to continue to grow our market share of therapy contracts by further enhancing our reputation in the industry and by demonstrating the value of our services to prospective customers and their patients.  We also plan to capitalize on organic cash flow growth opportunities through expansion of clinical therapy services to existing customers and continued improvement in the productivity of our therapists through the use of technology and improved workflow.
 Improve operating efficiency.  We are continually focused on improving operating efficiency and controlling costs, while maintaining quality patient care.  Investments in information systems, the development of tools to more effectively manage operating costs and the reengineering of key business and operating processes are an economically effective way to organically grow cash flow.  
 Grow through selective acquisitions and successful integration. The post-acute care industry is highly fragmented.  The vast majority of skilled nursing facilities are owned by local and regional groups, providing an opportunity for industry consolidation.  As the largest operator of skilled nursing facilities in the United States, we are well positioned to purchase facilities.  In today’s challenging economic, credit and reimbursement environment, many operators are facing challenges due to scale limitations vis-à-vis their larger competitors.  As local and regional groups seek an exit strategy, we believe we can make compelling offers for their businesses owing to the strong strategic fit with our businesses.  Non-strategic buyers and buyers with limited acquisition and integration experience may not be able to achieve the same synergies and, therefore, may not be able to make similar offers.
 We seek strategic acquisitions in selected target markets with strong demographic trends for growth in our service population.  Expansion of existing facility clusters and the creation of new clusters in local markets will allow us to leverage existing operations and to achieve greater operating efficiencies.  Given our existing scale and geographic footprint, growth through acquisition can often be achieved more rapidly and efficiently than organic development.  
 Position ourselves for success in a post-healthcare reform environment. As healthcare reform continues to be implemented, we believe post-acute healthcare providers who provide quality diversified care, have density and strong reputations in local markets, have good relationships with acute care hospitals and operate with scale will have a 

 
  15

 
competitive advantage in an episodic payment environment.  Our previously described organic and strategic growth strategies will position us well to become a valuable partner to acute care hospitals and managed care organizations that are seeking to increase care coordination, reduce lengths of stay, more effectively manage healthcare costs and develop new care delivery and payment models.
 Government Regulation
 General
 Healthcare is an area of extensive and frequent regulatory change. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a significant impact on our methods and costs of doing business.  Our subsidiaries that provide healthcare services are subject to federal, state and local laws relating to, among other things, licensure, delivery, quality and adequacy of care, physical plant requirements, life safety, personnel and operating policies.  In addition, our provider subsidiaries are subject to federal and state laws that govern billing and reimbursement, relationships with vendors and business relationships with physicians.  Such laws include the Anti-Kickback Statue, the FCA, the Stark Law and state corporate practice of medicine statutes.
 Governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our skilled nursing facilities, assisted/senior living facilities and outpatient rehabilitation agencies to verify that we continue to comply with the regulations and standards. We must pass these inspections to remain licensed under state laws, to comply with our Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements, and, in some instances, to continue our participation in the Veterans Administration program. We can only participate in these third-party payment programs if inspections by regulatory authorities reveal that our facilities and agencies are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements. In the ordinary course of business, we may receive notices from federal or state regulatory authorities alleging deficiencies in certain regulatory practices. These statements of deficiency may require us to take corrective action to regain and maintain compliance.  In some cases, federal or state regulators may impose other remedies including imposition of CMPs, temporary payment bans, loss of certification as a provider in the Medicare and/or Medicaid program and revocation of a state operating license. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are subject from time to time to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies related to compliance with participation and payment rules under government payment programs. These inquiries may originate from the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) audits, state Medicaid agencies, local and state ombudsman offices and CMS Recovery Audit Contractors, among other agencies. We believe that the regulatory environment surrounding the healthcare industry subjects providers to intense scrutiny.  Federal and state governments continue to impose citations for regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory penalties, including demands for refund of overpayments, expanded CMPs that extend over long periods of time and date back to incidents long before surveyor visits, Medicare and Medicaid payment bans and terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We vigorously contest these matters where appropriate; however, there are significant legal and other expenses involved that consume our financial and personnel resources. Expansion of enforcement activity could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Quality of Care Measures
 In 2008, CMS created the Five-Star Quality Rating System (the Star Ratings) to help consumers, families and caregivers compare skilled nursing facilities and choose providers more easily.  Skilled nursing facilities are rated from one to five stars based on three components: survey results over the past three years, quality measure calculations and staffing data. Each of the components receives star rankings as well. Skilled nursing facilities with five stars are considered to have much above average quality and skilled nursing facilities with one star are considered to have quality much below average. Families are increasingly consulting the Star Ratings prior to placing a family member in a skilled nursing facility and hospital referral partners are increasingly narrowing their panels of skilled nursing facilities to include only those with at least a three-star overall rating. However, CMS has acknowledged that there are limitations in using the Star Ratings to make inferences about nursing center quality, including (i) variations by state in survey processes, (ii) the use of a single two-week snapshot for the staffing rating and (iii) quality measures do not represent all aspects of care that could be important to consumers.  The foundation of the Star Rating is the annual survey.  Survey results carry forward three years with the most recent survey weighted 50% while older surveys are weighted 33% and 17%, respectively. 

 
  16

 

 The table below summarizes the Star Rating given to our skilled nursing facilities:
    
 | Year ended 
 | December 31, 2016
Number of skilled nursing facilities | | 473 | 
Number of 3, 4 and 5-Star skilled nursing facilities | | 243 | 
Percentage of 3, 4 and 5-Star skilled nursing facilities | | 51 | %

      We strive to provide quality care and to achieve higher Star Ratings.  Our performance on Star Ratings has been negatively impacted by: (i) CMS changing its Star Rating scoring methodology in 2015 and introduction of new quality measures in 2016 resulting in many skilled nursing facilities (for both us and third parties) experiencing lower quality measure ratings, resulting in a decrease in Star Ratings; and (ii) the acquisition of Skilled Healthcare Group, Inc., whose skilled nursing facilities generally had poorer than average Star Ratings.  
 Civil and Criminal Fraud and Abuse Laws and Enforcement
 Federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulate both the provision of services to government program beneficiaries and the methods and requirements for submitting claims for services rendered to such beneficiaries. Under these laws, individuals and organizations can be penalized for submitting claims for services that are not provided; that have been inadequately provided; billed in an incorrect manner, intentionally or accidentally, or other than as actually provided; not medically necessary; provided by an improper person; accompanied by an illegal inducement to utilize or refrain from utilizing a service or product; or billed or coded in a manner that does not otherwise comply with applicable governmental requirements. Penalties also may be imposed for violation of anti-kickback and patient referral laws.
 Federal and state governments have a range of criminal, civil and administrative sanctions available to penalize and remediate healthcare fraud and abuse, including exclusion of the provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, imposition of civil and criminal fines, suspension of payments and, in the case of individuals, imprisonment.
 We have internal policies and procedures, including a program designed to facilitate compliance with and to reduce exposure for violations of these and other laws and regulations. However, because enforcement efforts presently are widespread within the industry and may vary from region to region, there can be no assurance that our internal policies and procedures will significantly reduce or eliminate exposure to civil or criminal sanctions or adverse administrative determinations.
 Anti-Kickback Statute
 Federal law commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of anything of value, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony, and sanctions for each violation include imprisonment of up to five years, significant criminal fines, significant CMPs plus three times the amount claimed or three times the remuneration offered, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Additionally, violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA.  Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against kickbacks and other practices that are intended to induce referrals applicable to all payors.
 We are required under the Medicare requirements for participation and some state licensing laws to contract with numerous healthcare providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and hospice agencies and to arrange for these individuals or entities to provide services to our residents and patients. In addition, we have contracts with other suppliers, including pharmacies, laboratories, x-ray companies, ambulance services and medical equipment companies. Some of these individuals or entities may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to us, and we may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to these individuals or entities. Certain safe harbor provisions have been created so that although a relationship could potentially implicate the federal anti-kickback statute, it would not be treated as an offense under the statute. We attempt to structure these arrangements in a manner that falls within one of the safe harbors. Some of these arrangements may not ultimately satisfy the applicable safe harbor requirements, but failure to meet the safe harbor does not necessarily mean an arrangement is illegal.

 
  17

 

 We believe that our arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers are in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. However, if any of our arrangements with third parties were to be challenged and found to be in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, we could be required to repay any amounts we received, subject to criminal penalties, and we could be excluded from participating in federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The occurrence of any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Stark Law
 Federal law commonly known as the Stark Law prohibits a physician from making referrals for particular healthcare services to entities with which the physician (or an immediate family member of the physician) has a financial relationship if the services are payable by Medicare or Medicaid. If an arrangement is covered by the Stark Law, the requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met for the physician to be able to make referrals to the entity for designated health services and for the entity to be able to bill for these services. Although the term “designated health services” does not include long-term care services, some of the services provided at our skilled nursing facilities and other related business units are classified as designated health services, including PT, SLP and OT services. The term “financial relationship” is defined very broadly to include most types of ownership or compensation relationships. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from seeking payment from the patient or the Medicare and Medicaid programs for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral.
 The Stark Law contains exceptions for certain physician ownership or investment interests in, and certain physician compensation arrangements with, certain entities. If a compensation arrangement or investment relationship between a physician, or immediate family member, and an entity satisfies the applicable requirements for a Stark Law exception, the Stark Law will not prohibit the physician from referring patients to the entity for designated health services. The exceptions for compensation arrangements cover employment relationships, personal services contracts and space and equipment leases, among others.
 If an entity violates the Stark Law, it could be subject to significant civil penalties. The entity also may be excluded from participating in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. If the Stark Law were found to apply to our relationships with referring physicians and no exception under the Stark Law were available, we would be required to restructure these relationships or refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from these physicians. If we were found to have submitted claims to Medicare or Medicaid for services provided pursuant to a referral prohibited by the Stark Law, we would be required to repay any amounts we received from Medicare or Medicaid for those services and could be subject to CMPs. Further, we could be excluded from participating in Medicare and Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we were required to repay any amounts to Medicare or Medicaid, subjected to fines, or excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would be harmed significantly.
 As directed by PPACA, in 2010 CMS released a self-referral disclosure protocol (SRDP) for potential or actual violations of the Stark Law. Under SRDP, CMS states that it may, but is not required to, reduce the amounts due and owing for a Stark Law violation, and will consider the following factors in deciding whether to grant a reduction: (1) the nature and extent of the improper or illegal practice; (2) the timeliness of the self-disclosure; (3) the cooperation in providing additional information related to the disclosure; (4) the litigation risk associated with the matter disclosed; and (5) the financial position of the disclosing party.
 Many states have physician relationship and referral statutes that are similar to the Stark Law. These laws generally apply regardless of the payor. We believe that our operations are structured to comply with the Stark Law and applicable state laws with respect to physician relationships and referrals. However, any finding that we are not in compliance with these laws could require us to change our operations or could subject us to penalties. This, in turn, could significantly harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 False Claims Act
 Federal and state laws prohibit the submission of false claims and other acts that are considered fraudulent, wasteful or abusive. Under the federal FCA, actions against a provider can be initiated by the federal government or by a private party on behalf of the federal government. These private parties, who are often referred to as “qui tam relators” or “relators,” are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government. Both direct enforcement activity by the government and qui tam relator actions have increased significantly in recent years. The use of private enforcement

actions against healthcare providers has increased dramatically, in part because the relators are entitled to share in a portion of any settlement or judgment.
 A FCA violation occurs when a provider knowingly submits a claim for items or services not provided.  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 expanded the scope of the FCA by creating liability for knowingly retaining an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers. The submission of false claims or the failure to timely repay overpayments may lead to the imposition of significant CMPs, significant criminal fines and imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in state and federally-funded healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Allegations of poor quality of care can also lead to FCA actions under a theory of worthless services.  Worthless services cases allege that although care was provided it was so deficient that it was tantamount to no service at all.    
 In recent years, prosecutors and relators are increasingly bringing FCA claims based on the implied certification theory as an expansion of the scope of the FCA.  Under the implied certification theory, a violation of the FCA occurs when a provider’s request for payment implies a certification of compliance with the applicable statutes, regulations or contract provisions that are preconditions to payment.  This development has increased the risk that a healthcare company will have to defend a false claims action, pay fines and treble damages or settlement amounts or be excluded from the federal and state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of the FCA. Many states have enacted similar laws providing for imposition of civil and criminal penalties for the filing of fraudulent claims.
 Because we submit thousands of claims to Medicare each year, and there is a relatively long statute of limitations under the FCA, there is a risk that intentional, or even negligent or recklessly submitted claims that prove to be incorrect, or even billing errors, cost reporting errors or lapses in statutory or regulatory compliance with regard to the provision of healthcare services (including, without limitation the Anti-Kickback Statue and the federal self-referral law discussed above), could result in significant civil or criminal penalties against us. For example, see Note 21, "Commitment and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings," for information regarding matters in which the government is pursuing, or has expressed an intent to pursue, legal remedies against us under the FCA and similar state laws. 
 We believe that our operations comply with the FCA and similar state laws. However, if our claims practices were challenged and found to violate the applicable laws, any finding that we are not in compliance with these laws could require us to change our operations or could subject us to penalties or make us ineligible to participate in certain government funded healthcare programs, which could in turn significantly harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Patient Privacy and Security Laws
 There are numerous legislative and regulatory requirements at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy and security of health information.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) contains provisions that require us to adopt and maintain business procedures designed to protect the privacy, security and integrity of patients' individual health information.  States also have laws that apply to the privacy of healthcare information. We must comply with these state privacy laws to the extent that they are more protective of healthcare information or provide additional protections not afforded by HIPAA.
 HIPAA's security standards were designed to protect specified information against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the information and to protect the information against unauthorized use or disclosure.  These standards have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on the healthcare industry because they impose extensive requirements and restrictions on the use and disclosure of identifiable patient information.  In addition, HIPAA established uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information.
 The Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH Act) expanded the requirements and noncompliance penalties under HIPAA and require correspondingly intensive compliance efforts by companies such as ours, including self-disclosures of breaches of unsecured health information to affected patients, federal officials, and, in some cases, the media.  These laws make unauthorized employee access illegal and subject to self-disclosure and penalties.  Other states may adopt similar or more extensive breach notice and privacy requirements. Compliance with these regulations could require us to make significant investments of money and other resources. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable state and federal regulations relating to privacy and security of patient 

 
  19

 
information. However, if we fail to comply with the applicable regulations, we could be subject to significant penalties and other adverse consequences.
 Certificates of Need (CON) and Other Regulatory Matters
 There are CON programs in 34 states and the District of Columbia.  We are required in these jurisdictions to obtain CON approval or exemption prior to certain changes including without limitation, change in ownership, capital expenditures over certain limits, development of a new facility or expansion of services of an existing facility or service in order to control overdevelopment of healthcare projects. Certain states that do not have CON programs may have other laws or regulations that limit or restrict the development or expansion of healthcare projects. In the event we choose to develop or expand the operations of our subsidiaries, the development or expansion could be affected adversely by the inability to obtain the necessary approvals, changes in the standards applicable to such approvals or possible delays and expenses associated with obtaining such approvals.  Failure to comply with state requirements with CON or other regulations that address development or expansion of services could adversely affect the progress or completion of a healthcare project. State Operating License Requirements
 We are required to obtain state licenses, certificates or permits to operate each of our nursing facilities. Many states require similar licenses or certificates for assisted/senior living facilities, and some states require a license to operate outpatient agencies. Medicare requires compliance with applicable state laws as a requirement of participation.  In addition, healthcare professionals and practitioners are required to be licensed in most states. We take measures to ensure that our healthcare professionals are properly licensed and participate in required continuing education programs. We believe that our operating companies and personnel that provide these services have all required licenses or certifications necessary for our current operations. Failure to obtain, maintain or renew a required license, permit or certification could adversely affect our ability to bill for services or operate in the ordinary course.  Competition
 Our skilled nursing facilities compete primarily on a local and regional basis with other skilled nursing facilities and with assisted/senior living facilities, from national and regional chains to smaller providers owning as few as a single facility. Competitors include other for-profit providers as well as non-profits, religiously-affiliated facilities, and government-owned facilities. We also compete under certain circumstances with inpatient rehabilitation facilities and long-term acute care hospitals. Our ability to compete successfully varies from location to location and depends on a number of factors, including the number of competing facilities in the local market and the types of services available at those facilities, our local reputation for quality care of patients, the commitment and expertise of our caregivers, our local service offerings and treatment programs, the cost of care in each locality, and the physical appearance, location, age and condition of our facilities.
 We seek to compete effectively in each market by establishing a reputation within the local community for quality of care, attractive and comfortable facilities, and providing specialized healthcare with an emphasized focus on high-acuity patients. Programs targeting high-acuity patients, including our PowerBack Rehabilitation facilities, generally have a higher staffing level per patient than our other inpatient facilities and compete more directly with IRFs and LTAC hospitals, in addition to other skilled nursing facilities. We believe that the average cost to a third-party payor for the treatment of our typical high-acuity patient is lower if that patient is treated in one of our skilled nursing facilities than if that same patient were to be treated in an IRF or LTAC hospital.
 Our other services, such as assisted/senior living facilities and rehabilitation therapy provided to third-party facilities, also compete with local, regional, and national companies. The primary competitive factors in these businesses are similar to those for our skilled nursing facilities and include reputation, cost to provide the services, quality of clinical services, responsiveness to patient/resident needs, location and the ability to provide support in other areas such as information management and patient recordkeeping.
 Increased competition could limit our ability to attract and retain patients, attract and retain employees or to expand our business. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, may have greater brand recognition and may be more established in their respective communities than we are. Competing companies may also offer newer facilities or different programs or services than we do and may as a result be more attractive to our current patients, to potential patients and to referral sources.

     Employees and Labor Relations
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed an aggregate of approximately 82,000 active employees as follows:  56,000 in our inpatient services segment, 18,200 (primarily therapists) in our rehabilitation therapy segment, and 7,800 in our all other services segment, which includes our administrative services subsidiary.  
 Our most significant operating cost is labor, which accounted for approximately 69% of our operating expenses from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.   We seek to manage our labor costs by improving staffing retention, maintaining competitive labor rates, and reducing reliance on overtime compensation and temporary staffing services.
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 102 collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 8,800 active employees at our skilled nursing facilities. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 Risk Management
 We have developed a risk management program intended to control our insurance and professional liability costs. As part of this program, we have implemented an arbitration agreement program at each of our nursing facilities under which, upon admission and to the extent permitted under existing regulations, patients are requested (but not required) to execute an agreement that requires disputes to be arbitrated instead of litigated in court. We believe that this program accelerates resolution of disputes and reduces our liability exposure and related costs. We have also established an incident reporting process that involves the provision of tracking and trending data to our facility administrators.      Insurance
 We maintain a variety of types of insurance, including general and professional liability, workers' compensation,  fiduciary liability, property,  cyber/privacy liability, directors' and officers' liability, crime, boiler and machinery, automobile, employment practices liability and earthquake and flood. We believe that our insurance programs are adequate and where there has been a direct transfer of risk to the insurance carrier our risk is limited to the cost of the premium. We self-insure a significant portion of our potential liabilities for several risks, including certain types of general and professional liability, workers’ compensation and health benefits. To the extent our insurance coverage is insufficient or unavailable to cover losses that would otherwise be insurable, or to the extent that our estimates of anticipated liabilities that we self-insure are significantly lower than the actual self-insured liabilities that we incur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  For additional information regarding our insurance programs, see Note 21, “Commitments and Contingencies – Loss Reserves for Certain Self-Insured Programs,” in the financial statements included elsewhere in this report.     Environmental Matters
 We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. As a healthcare provider, we face regulatory requirements in areas of air and water quality control, medical and low-level radioactive waste management and disposal, asbestos management, response to mold and lead-based paint in our facilities and employee safety.
 In our role as owner of subsidiaries which operate our facilities (including our leased facilities), we also may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous substances that are located on the property, including any such substances that may have migrated off, or discharged or transported from the property. Part of our operations involves the handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and/or discharge of hazardous, infectious, toxic, flammable and other hazardous materials, wastes, pollutants or contaminants. These activities may result in damage to individuals, property or the environment; may interrupt operations and/or increase costs; may result in legal liability, damages, injunctions or fines; may result in investigations, administrative proceedings, penalties or other governmental agency actions; and may not be covered by insurance. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements. However, there can be no assurance that we will not incur environmental liabilities in the future, and such liabilities may result in material adverse consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations.
