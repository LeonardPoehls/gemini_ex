Item 1. Business. 
Organization 
 Reis, Inc. is a Maryland corporation. When we refer to Reis or the Company, we are referring to Reis, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company provides commercial real estate market information and analytical tools to real estate professionals, through its Reis Services subsidiary. For disclosure and financial reporting purposes, this business is referred to as the Reis Services segment. 
Business 
 Reis Services 
 Reis Services, including its predecessors, was founded in 1980. Reis maintains a proprietary database containing detailed information on commercial properties in metropolitan markets and neighborhoods throughout the U.S. The database contains information on apartment, office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage, seniors housing, student housing and affordable housing properties, and is used by real estate investors, lenders and other professionals to make informed buying, selling and financing decisions. In addition, Reis data is used by debt and equity investors to assess, quantify and manage the risks of default and loss associated with individual mortgages, properties, portfolios and real estate backed securities. Reis currently provides its information services to many of the nations leading lending institutions, equity investors, brokers and appraisers. 
Product Overview 
 The Companys product portfolio features: Reis SE, its flagship delivery platform aimed at larger and mid-sized enterprises; ReisReports, aimed at prosumers and smaller enterprises; and Reis Portfolio CRE and other portfolio support products and services, aimed primarily at risk managers and credit administrators at banks and non-bank lending institutions. It is through these products that Reis provides online access to a proprietary database of commercial real estate information and analytical tools designed to facilitate debt and equity transactions as well as ongoing asset and portfolio evaluations. Depending on the product or level of entitlement, users have access to market trends and forecasts at metropolitan and neighborhood levels throughout the U.S. and/or detailed building-specific information such as rents, vacancy rates, lease terms, property sales, new construction listings and property valuation estimates. Reiss products are designed to meet the demand for timely and accurate information to support the decision making of property owners, developers, builders, banks and non-bank lenders, equity investors and service providers. These real estate professionals require access to timely information on both the performance and pricing of assets, including detailed data on market transactions, supply, absorption, rents and sale prices. This information is critical to all aspects of valuing assets and financing their acquisition, development and construction. 
Industry Dynamics 
 The U.S. commercial real estate market (CRE) is a multi-trillion dollar asset class; most forecasters expect a relatively healthy outlook for 2017 and beyond.1 Unrest in global economics and politics have strengthened investor preferences for the U.S. CRE market as a relatively safe haven. The Brexit vote in June 2016 caused uncertainty in Europe, and major Asian markets like China and Japan are still dealing with relatively slow economic growth. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields experienced volatility throughout the year, reaching a low of 1.37% in early July following the turmoil of Brexit, but spiked to as high as 2.6% in the month following the November 8, 2016 election. We believe global and political uncertainty should continue to drive international capital flows into the U.S., and as both foreign and domestic investors seek yield that they will consider income producing real estate as an attractive alternative. 
 The International Monetary Fund expects the global economy to grow faster over the next two years, relative to the lackluster outturn in 2016.2 While there is uncertainty around whether the incoming U.S. administration will implement new policies, following the election, equity markets reacted positively to the expectation of business-friendly changes to tax, trade and infrastructure policies. As of the first half of 2016, Chinese investment in U.S. CRE grew by 19 percent year-over-year. If this is considered a harbinger of how other foreign countries will view the asset class, then 2017 could potentially attract at least as much foreign capital as the prior year.

Institutions are preparing for possible cyclical weakness in selected multifamily, office and retail markets. As a result, investors have begun to allocate funds to CRE asset classes such as self-storage, student housing, seniors housing, and manufactured housing.1 The mixed economic outlook going forward and uncertainty with regard to the new U.S. administrations economic policies suggest that CRE professionals will have a heightened need to monitor market conditions for both portfolio and transactional purposes. Reiss suite of products and services are uniquely positioned to be responsive to this increased focus on market trends and forecasts. 
Demand for Data and Analytical Tools 
 CRE professionals have historically lacked the data and analytical tools available to their peers in other asset classes. With changes in the regulatory climate and other post-recession reforms, as well as the continuing need to make well informed decisions, the demand for thorough and accurate CRE data has increased rapidly. 
 The regulatory requirements (such as mark-to-market policies, Basel II and Basel III capital requirements), Federal Reserve and FDIC guidelines and other measures have increased the need for market and portfolio monitoring for CRE professionals. For example: 
 

 | the Federal Reserve conducts an annual exercise known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) in which financial institutions conduct stress tests using downside economic and market scenarios from which they develop capital allocations and reserves;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | increasing interest among REITs and other equity investors is critical to monitor and update the net asset values of the commercial real estate in their portfolios; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | corporations, in response to increasing concentrations of commercial real estate assets on their balance sheets, must meet additional disclosure requirements that may be imposed by the FASB and IASB.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These requirements have generated demand for accurate and timely information, as well as access to valuation tools to evaluate the underlying collateral supporting mortgages and mortgage-related securities. 
 CRE professionals demand relevant market and transaction data to support effective decision-making and financial reporting throughout all stages of the commercial real estate transaction lifecycle. Access to information on supply, demand, asking and effective rents, lease terms, sales prices, new construction, cap rates and other detailed data across large and small metro areas is sought by property owners, developers, banks, non-bank lenders, brokers and asset managers across the country. To meet the growing demand for data and custom analytics, Reis has designed a suite of products and/or customized reports. 
 Operations 
 As commercial real estate markets grow in size and complexity, Reis continues to invest in the databases, technologies, intellectual capital and personnel critical to supporting the information needs of commercial real estate professionals. Specifically, Reis has: 

 | developed expertise in data collection across multiple markets and property types;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | invested in the analytical expertise to develop decision support systems that generate market trends and forecasts, property valuations, credit analytics, transaction support and risk management;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | created product development expertise to collect market feedback and translate it into new products and reports; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | invested in a robust technology infrastructure to disseminate these tools to the wide variety of market participants.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These investments have established Reis as a leading provider of commercial real estate information and analytical tools to the investment community. Reis continues to develop and introduce new products, expand and add new markets and data, and find new ways to deliver existing information to meet client demand, as more fully described below under  Products and Services. The depth and breadth of Reiss data and expertise are critical in allowing Reis to grow its business. 
 Proprietary Databases 
 Reis develops and maintains three highly curated, proprietary databases which include information on (1) property performance, (2) new construction and (3) sales transactions. The significant characteristics of the Reis databases include: 
 
1 https://www.pwc.com/us/en/asset-management/real-estate/assets/pwc-emerging-trends-in-real-estate-2017.pdf

4 
 

 | Breadth - coverage of nine property types, including apartment, office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage, seniors housing, student housing and affordable housing properties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Geography - national coverage of up to 275 of the largest U.S. metropolitan CRE markets, approximately 7,600 discrete market areas and segments with submarket boundaries proprietary to Reis;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Depth - captures critical information such as occupancies, rents, rent discounts, tenant improvement allowances, lease terms, expenses, buyer, seller, purchase price, capitalization rate, financing details and other key factors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | History - up to 37 years of data through multiple cycles of economic/market peaks and troughs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Frequency - market and submarket reports available quarterly, monthly, or for certain apartment reports, daily, and sales comparables and new construction information updated on daily and weekly schedules.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following table lists the number of metropolitan markets for each of the nine types of commercial real estate covered by Reis in the property performance database and new construction database: 
 

 | December 31, | December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 
Apartment (A) | | 275 | 275
Office (A) | | 190 | 190
Retail | | 190 | 190
Warehouse/distribution | | 47 | 47 
Flex/research & development | | 47 | 47 
Self storage | | 50 | 50 
Seniors housing | | 110 | 110
Student housing | | 200 | 200
Affordable housing (B) | | 45 |  


(A) In March and June 2016, Reis enhanced its apartment and office coverage, respectively, with market reports that include new features, structural details and comparative performance analytics. 
(B) In February 2017, the number of affordable housing markets was expanded by 65 to 110 markets. 

 Reiss long-standing relationships with thousands of data sources, including building owners, property managers and agents, represent a unique and highly valuable asset that benefits from decades of investment. The Company is recognized by the industry and the business and trade press as the premier source of objective, timely and granular market information, a reputation attributable to two key factors: (1) Reis is viewed as independent as it does not compete as a broker in the listings space; and (2) Reis information is used by owners and managers in the underwriting, due diligence and marketing of properties, mortgages and real estate backed securities at both the single asset and portfolio levels. 
 Property Performance Dababase 
 Reis is continually expanding its property level and market coverage by geography and property type. In August 2016, Reis introduced coverage on its ninth property type, affordable housing, with information on 176 counties in 45 metropolitan areas and as of February 2017, expanded coverage of this property type to include information on 256 counties in 110 metropolitan areas. In addition, in 2017, Reis expects to enhance its market reports in all sectors consistent with many of the enhancements made in March 2016 to its apartment market reports and in June 2016 to its office market reports. These enhancements include licensed photographs, sector-specific details, contact information, effective rent at the property level, sales transaction history, and numerous illustrative charts and graphs, all to fortify Reiss position as the preferred source for comparables information among all real estate professionals involved in buying, selling, leasing, or managing real estate assets. Reis expects to add similar details to property level reports in other sectors, while also introducing high level analytical modules that take a broader perspective across markets and geographies. In July 2016, Reis moved to daily reporting of apartment rent and other property information in its popular Apartment Rent Comparables report. Further development plans for 2017 include a module that will allow portfolio managers and C-level executives to look for market opportunities based on Reiss forecasts at the market and submarket level. 
 Reiss core property performance database contains information on competitive, income-producing properties in the U.S. apartment, office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage, seniors housing, student housing and affordable

 housing sectors. On an ongoing basis, Reis surveys and receives data downloads from building owners, leasing agents and managers which include key building performance statistics including, among others: occupancy rates; rents; rent discounts and other concessions; tenant improvement allowances; lease terms; and operating expenses. In addition, Reis processes multiple data sources on commercial real estate, including: public filings databases; tax assessor records; deed transfers; planning boards; and numerous local, regional and national publications and commercial real estate websites. Reis screens and assembles large volumes of data into integrated supply and demand trends on a monthly basis at the neighborhood (submarket) and metropolitan market levels. All collected data are subjected to a rigorous quality assurance and validation process developed over many years. At the property level, surveyors compare the data collected in the current period with data previously collected on that property and similar properties. If any unusual changes in rents and vacancies are identified, follow-up procedures are performed for verification or clarification of the results. All aggregate market data at the submarket and market levels are also subjected to comprehensive quality controls. 
 New Construction Database 
 In addition to its core property database, Reis develops and maintains a new construction database that identifies and monitors projects that are being added to our covered markets. Detailed tracking of the supply side of the commercial real estate market is critical to projecting performance changes at the market and submarket levels. This database is updated weekly and reports relevant information such as project size, property type, location, status, and estimated completion dates for projects that are planned, proposed or under construction. 
Sales Transactions Database 
 In September 2016, Reis expanded its commercial real estate sales transactions database including virtually all U.S. markets and property types, regardless of geography or sector. The new offering is expected to appeal to mortgage and property originators and underwriters, brokers and appraisers, and any other real estate professionals seeking the most comprehensive database of CRE transactions to source deals, search for related business, or conduct due diligence. Reiss sales transactions database includes key structural data points, including but not limited to address, land use code, parcel number, and lot size, in addition to key transactional data points, such as buyer and seller name, sale price, sale date, deed reference, and financing details when available, as well as other desirable datapoints and licensed photographs. 
Products and Services 
 Reis has invested in a robust technology infrastructure to disseminate a number of market information products to meet the demands of a wide variety of commercial real estate professionals, from large financial institutions seeking an integrated commercial real estate portfolio management platform, to a single access user seeking local market intelligence. Reis is committed to consistently upgrading and expanding its product offering to reach new markets and new types of consumers of commercial real estate information.   Reis SE 
 Reis SE (or sometimes referred to as Reis Subscriber Edition), available at www.reis.com, is the Companys flagship product, designed to assist in market research, due diligence and support of commercial real estate transactions, including loan originations, underwriting, acquisitions, risk assessment (such as loan loss reserves and impairment analyses), portfolio monitoring, asset management and appraisal. Reports are retrievable by street address, property type (apartment, office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage, seniors housing, student housing and affordable housing) or on the market/submarket level and are available as full color, presentation quality documents or in spreadsheet formats.

 ReisReports 
 ReisReports is a product tailored to meet the needs of smaller enterprises and individuals, professional investors, brokers and appraisers, available at www.ReisReports.com.

ReisReports is available on a monthly or annual subscription basis at affordable price points. 
 The addressable subscriber market for ReisReports includes hundreds of thousands of prosumers and small enterprises. To expand the total user base of ReisReports, the Company markets through various traditional and online media channels to CRE professionals active in individual metropolitan areas. 
 Reis Portfolio CRE and Other Portfolio Support Products and Services 
 Reis Portfolio CRE enables clients to quickly and thoroughly assess portfolio risks and opportunities by integrating client loan and property information with Reis property and submarket data which is processed through a credit model. The solution is delivered in a web-based, visually engaging interface. Reis Portfolio CRE is targeted to both debt and equity capital providers active in U.S. commercial real estate and, specifically, to banks with significant CRE loan exposure. 
 As a loan-level analysis and surveillance platform, Reis Portfolio CRE enables property valuation, credit analysis, stress testing, benchmarking and portfolio pricing.

 The Reis Portfolio CRE platform is intended for both large and small lending institutions, Commercial Mortgage Backed Security, or CMBS, investors and equity investors, among others.

Reis stands ready to assist all client and non-client financial services firms and other real estate professionals however they need information or services.

Data Redistribution / Marketing Alliances 
 The Company has established data redistribution agreements with information service providers as part of a strategy designed to raise brand awareness and generate sales leads for Reiss information and services. Over time, third party users may enter into agreements with Reis directly in order to gain access to the full suite of reports and analytical modules. The Companys data redistribution agreements are typically multi-year contracts in length, do not afford access to Reiss proprietary database and provide limited views of Reiss market data. Reis has also established marketing alliances to promote ReisReports to its alliance partners members through discounts, email outreach, website advertising and newsletter ads. 
 Cost of Service 
 Reiss data is made available in six ways, with price points that are reflective of the level of content being made available: 
 

 | annual and multi-year subscriptions to Reis SE ranging in price from $1,000 to in excess of $1,000,000, depending upon the subscribers line of business and the combination of markets, property types and reports subscribed to; renewals for Reis SE are negotiated in advance of the expiration of an existing contract based on factors such as a subscribers historical and projected report consumption;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | annual and multi-year subscriptions to Reis Portfolio CRE typically ranging in price from the low tens of thousands of dollars into the hundreds of thousands of dollars;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | capped Reis SE subscriptions typically ranging in price from $1,000 to $25,000, allowing clients to download a fixed retail value of reports over a period of up to twelve months;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | subscriptions to ReisReports, which are charged to a credit card, having a retail price in the low hundreds of dollars per month, depending on the level of service subscribed to (monthly or annual pricing options are available);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | custom data deliverables ranging in price from $1,000 for a specific data element to hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars for custom data deliveries, portfolio valuation and credit analysis; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | individual reports, which can be purchased with a credit card, having retail prices up to $999 per report, are available to anyone who visits Reiss retail website or contacts Reis via telephone, fax or email; however, certain reports are only available with an annual subscription or capped subscription account.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Reiss revenue model is based primarily on annual subscriptions that are paid in accordance with contractual billing terms. Reis recognizes revenue from its subscription contracts on a ratable basis; for example, one-twelfth of the value of a one-year contract is recognized monthly. In the case of custom data deliverables, revenue is recognized upon completion and delivery to the customers, provided that no significant Company obligations remain. 
 Subscribers 
 Reis enters into contracts with customers for all of its subscription based products and services. A subscribing entity may have one or many users entitled to access Reis SE. Nearly all of our Reis Portfolio CRE subscribers are also Reis SE subscribers. These numbers do not include users who pay for individual reports by credit card or users of information available on third party platforms through our data redistribution relationships. 
 The vast majority of the Companys largest subscribers have utilized Reiss core product for many years and have represented a stable user and revenue base. Subscribers include banking institutions, property owners, brokers, lessors, builders, REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, developers, commercial banks, non-bank lenders, equity investors, appraisers, accountants, consultants, academia, and government institutions. At December 31, 2016, approximately 83% of Reis SE customers (based on total customer dollars) are debt and equity capital providers, with banks and other financial institutions comprising approximately 56% and investment funds and equity owners comprising approximately 27%; service providers account for the remaining 17%. 
Customer Service and Training 
 Reis focuses intensively on proactive training and customer support. Reiss customer service team offers customized on-site training and web-based and telephonic support, as well as weekly web-based training seminars open to all Reis SE subscribers. The corporate training team also visits with a large proportion of Reis SE subscribers on an ongoing basis. Additional points of subscriber contact

 include mid-year service reviews, a web-based subscriber feedback program and account manager visits. All of these contacts are used to assist subscribers with their utilization of Reis SE and identify opportunities for product adoption and increased usage and to solicit subscriber input for future product enhancements. Similarly, support and training are available to our ReisReports and Reis Portfolio CRE subscribers.

 Competition 
 Despite its multi-trillion dollar size, the commercial real estate industry continues to be underserved by information resources. Compared to equity and fixed income professionals, CRE practitioners have fewer options in meeting their market information and analytical needs. The disparity in available information resources is due, in part, to the limited reporting requirements imposed on private CRE firms which represent the majority of the industry. However, real estate transactions involve multiple participants who all require accurate historical and current market information. Therefore, in order to provide comprehensive and value-added products for all CRE practitioners, a database of commercial properties must be largely built from proprietary sources over many years. Key factors that influence the competitive position of commercial real estate information vendors include: the depth and breadth of underlying databases; ease of use; flexibility and functionality of the customer interface; the ability to keep the data up-to-date and accurate; frequency of reporting; scope of coverage by geography and property type; customer training and support; adoption of the service by industry leaders; consistent product innovation; recognition by general business and trade media; and price. 
 Reiss senior management believes that, on a national level, only a small number of firms serve the market information needs of U.S. commercial real estate investors and lenders. Reis competes directly and indirectly for subscribers with online services or websites targeted to commercial real estate professionals such as CoStar Group, Inc. (or CoStar) (including its Apartments.com, Property and Portfolio Research and LoopNet businesses), Real Capital Analytics, Inc., Xceligent, CBRE Econometric Advisors, and Moodys Analytics, Inc., as well as with various local and regional data providers covering selected markets and in-house real estate research departments. Another source of information has been market reports published by brokerage firms, although the promotional nature of many of these publications and their irregular publishing schedule make them less reliable as an ongoing resource for many CRE practitioners. 
Discontinued Operations  Residential Development Activities 
 Prior to May 2007, the name of the Company was Wellsford Real Properties, Inc. (Wellsford). Wellsford, which was originally formed on January 8, 1997, acquired the Reis Services business by merger in May 2007 (the Merger). Wellsfords primary operating activities immediately prior to the Merger, and conducted through its subsidiaries, were the development, construction and sale of three residential projects and its approximate 23% ownership interest in the Reis Services business. The Company completed the sale of the remaining residential units and homes at its projects or divested of the remaining residential projects in bulk sales by

The Residential Development Activities, including certain general and administrative costs that supported the related operations, were presented as a discontinued operation for 2015 and 2014 and are presented in the Other segment. Discontinued operations were completed as of December 31, 2015; therefore there were no discontinued operations activities during the year ended December 31, 2016.
