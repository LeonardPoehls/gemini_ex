ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company
Welbilt, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2015, is one of the world's leading commercial foodservice equipment companies. We design, manufacture and supply best-in-class food and beverage equipment for the global commercial foodservice market, offering customers unparalleled operator and patron insights, collaborative kitchen solutions, culinary expertise and world-class implementation support and service. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Welbilt, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively, are referred to as the "Company," "Welbilt," "we," "our" or "us."
On January 29, 2015, our former parent, The Manitowoc Company, Inc. ("MTW"), announced plans to create two independent, public companies to separately operate its two businesses: its crane business and its foodservice business. To effect the separation, MTW first undertook an internal reorganization, following which MTW held the crane business and Manitowoc Foodservice, Inc. ("MFS") held the foodservice business. Then on March 4, 2016, MTW distributed all the MFS common stock to MTW's shareholders on a pro rata basis whereby each MTW stockholder received one share of MFS common stock for every share of MTW common stock held as of the applicable record date (the "Distribution"), and MFS became an independent, publicly-traded company. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, "Spin-Off" refers to both the above described internal reorganization and the Distribution, collectively. Effective March 6, 2017, we renamed the Company to Welbilt, Inc. and rebranded our logo and brand identity to Welbilt. This change was part of our strategic repositioning after we spun off from MTW and represents a long-standing commitment to put customers’ needs first.
We are headquartered in New Port Richey, Florida, and operate 17 manufacturing facilities throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. We have a long history in the foodservice equipment manufacturing business with certain of our brands originating in the mid-1800's. Over time, we have become an industry-leading manufacturer of a full suite of commercial foodservice equipment supporting hot-side, cold-side and beverage dispensing capabilities. Our suite of products is used by commercial and institutional foodservice operators including full-service restaurants, quick-service restaurant ("QSR") chains, hotels, caterers, supermarkets, convenience stores, business and industry, hospitals, schools and other institutions. 
Today, we sell through a global network of over 3,500 distributors and dealers in over 100 countries. Our portfolio of 12 award-winning brands includes Cleveland™, Convotherm®, Delfield®, fitkitchenSM, Frymaster®, Garland®, Kolpak®, Lincoln™, Manitowoc® Ice, Merco®, Merrychef® and Multiplex®. All of our products are supported by KitchenCare®, our aftermarket parts and repair service business.
Our broad portfolio of foodservice equipment and services provides us with a balanced, diverse revenue base across geographies and foodservice product categories. Approximately 40-45% of our revenues are derived from the sale of cold category products, 35-40% are from hot category products and approximately 15-20% from aftermarket parts and services. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated net sales of $1,445.4 million and earnings from operations of $219.1 million. Based on sales by destination in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the majority of our revenue was derived from customers in the Americas at approximately 72%, with 17% from EMEA customers and 11% from APAC customers, after giving effect to the elimination of intersegment sales. 
Our global footprint positions us to capitalize on growth in both developed and emerging markets. Approximately 35% of our net sales are generated outside the U.S. and our full-line of hot and cold products and systems are sold in more than 100 countries globally, across three regional segments, the Americas (includes U.S., Canada and Latin America), EMEA (markets in Europe, including Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa) and APAC (principally comprised of markets in China, Australia, Japan, Philippines, South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and New Zealand).
We intend to achieve sustainable growth globally and drive increased profitability by leveraging our position as a leading commercial foodservice equipment provider, while selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions and partnerships, growing our customer base, expanding the frontiers of foodservice innovation and continuing to attract and grow industry-leading talent.
Global Foodservice Market and Foodservice Equipment Industry
The increasing demand for affordable dining is expected to continue on a global scale. Consumers in most markets are expected to gravitate towards more informal options, which is a trend seen among both higher income consumers looking to save during a slow economic recovery, as well as lower income consumers looking for accessible entry points for "on the go" food consumption. For foodservice equipment operators in emerging markets, this offers enormous opportunity for innovation, particularly in terms of format, as new restaurant consumers look to experiment with a variety of brands and experiences. QSR chains, in particular, have proved successful innovation in these markets.
Global and regional markets for food and foodservice are growing. The global foodservice industry was estimated at $2.6 trillion in 2017 according to Euromonitor, and is expected to increase at a compounded annual growth rate ("CAGR") of approximately 3% to reach $2.9 trillion in 2021. Global expansion and long-term focus on new emerging markets with new equipment is expected to be driven by chain restaurants in India, China, parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia in general. Increased government spending on infrastructure and investments in tourism are expected to support this change.

The main drivers for steady growth on a global basis are:

• | Population and income growth, especially in emerging markets and less developed regions: Global population tripled since the 1950s to approximately 7.6 billion and is expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050 and nearly 11.2 billion by 2100 according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. For the time period 2015-2100 the African continent is expected to nearly quadruple the population and will account for more than 85% of the world’s population growth. Countries outside of Africa with a projected absolute population growth of more than 100 million people include India, Pakistan, Iraq and the United States ("U.S."). Additionally, more hectic lifestyles with a culture changing to eating "on the go" and increasing demand for high-quality food prepared away from home in casual restaurants based on increasing disposable incomes is expected to lead to more and new offerings.


• | New dining / restaurant concepts and new markets for chain restaurants are increasing: Demand in the restaurant segment, one of our largest end markets, is driven by consumer disposable income, employment, investment in new establishments, and the underlying trend and demand for increased convenience and innovative dining concepts. In large emerging markets with an increasing middle-class like China, Argentina, Brazil and Nigeria, tremendous opportunity exists to broaden the range of new restaurant concepts and chains.


• | Health and safety issues: Food safety, sanitation and nutritional facts are a top priority for end-consumers. Proper food handling, environmental sustainability and social responsibility, reduction of energy use as well as less waste from unused food and premature food spoilage have become increasingly important. These issues are key drivers for the replacement and upgrade of existing equipment with our customers.

We believe the size of the global foodservice equipment markets, including the hot-side, cold-side, beverage, and aftermarket parts and service total $27 billion. It is expected to expand at a CAGR of 2.7% and is expected to reach over $29 billion in sales by 2020.
Based on Euromonitor studies, the U.S. foodservice market accounted for approximately 21%, or $557 billion, of the 2017 global foodservice market, while the Canadian foodservice market accounted for $44 billion in 2017. The market sizes are influenced by disposable income, increased employment, investment in new establishments and the underlying trend for increased convenience. The foodservice industry in the U.S. is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 2.4% during the 2018-2021 period and the Canada market is expected to experience nominal growth during the same period.
The Latin American foodservice industry is expected to experience 3% year over year growth from 2018-2021. This is mainly driven by the growth in the categories of cafés/bars and home delivery according to Euromonitor. Last year, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico demonstrated the highest productivity among all Latin American economies, which is based on gross domestic income per hour worked, while other countries like Brazil, Colombia or Venezuela, depending on their political environment, have the potential for significant future development.
The foodservice industry market in Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") in 2017 was approximately $600 billion and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.1% during the 2018-2021 period according to Euromonitor. Growth in the largest and most established EMEA countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France will mainly be in replacement equipment and aftermarket parts. In Western Europe, consumers have become much more value-conscious, and increasingly look to modern chains and fine-dining concepts as the best value for their spending. On the other hand, emerging markets show a greater percentage of new equipment purchases in the Middle East (especially the Emirates), Eastern Europe and some African countries.
Industrialization is a significant factor for the growth of the middle class in Asia Pacific ("APAC"), with the consequence of more disposable income for consumption. Foodservice sales were approximately $1.2 trillion in 2017 and are projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 4%, or $1.3 trillion during the 2018-2021 period based on Euromonitor data. Higher demand for new hotels and resorts and population growth in India and other Asian markets is expected to contribute to the overall market demand for new foodservice products.
Our History and Developments
Our heritage in the industry stretches back over a century, and our experience and expertise has grown tremendously over the years. In 1929, Henry and Alexander Hirsch established the Welbilt Stove Co., which acquired companies like Garland and Cleveland that had a history dating as far back as the mid-1800's. 
Through a focus on research and development, innovation, and superior customer service, as well as strategic and transformational acquisitions, the Company over time became an industry-leading source for foodservice equipment. Welbilt publicly listed on the NYSE in March 2016 under the name Manitowoc Foodservice, Inc. Effective March 6, 2017, we renamed the Company to Welbilt, Inc. and rebranded our logo and brand identity to Welbilt. This change was part of our strategic repositioning after we spun off from MTW on March 4, 2016 and represents a long-standing commitment to put customers’ needs first.

Product Innovation: Our Holistic Approach
We have a staff of in-house engineers and technicians on three continents, supplemented with external engineering resources, who collectively are responsible for improving existing products and developing new products. Our team of engineers focus on developing cost effective, innovative, high-performance, low-maintenance products that are intended to solve problems for our customers in differentiated ways and create brand loyalty among customers. They work closely with our culinary, manufacturing and marketing staff enabling us to identify changing end-user requirements, implement new technologies and effectively pursue product innovations. 
We strive to deliver products and solutions that enable our customers to provide fresh, new food experiences to consumers outside the home globally. Consumer demands are constantly changing, and a more health-conscious public is looking for fresh, natural alternatives to traditional out-of-home eating options. They increasingly care about how food is sourced, handled and prepared. We are focused on providing our customers with the equipment they need to build on the opportunities from these dynamic changes in the foodservice market.
Through innovation, we strive to simplify and improve the speed and flexibility of restaurant operations, improve the quality of the food, improve health and sanitation, and reduce the overall energy consumption and life cycle operating costs of the equipment. We believe that these benefits can also be enhanced by mobile connectivity and monitoring.

• | Productivity, Speed and Flexibility: Kitchens that occupy less space, have higher output and are easier to operate are key to growth in the foodservice industry, particularly in urban locations. Greater speed and equipment flexibility also allow for higher productivity and a wider range of menu options. Innovative control systems can improve information flow in the kitchen by letting operators know what and when to cook, and how to maintain and clean the equipment. Controls innovations under development include intuitive touch-screen user interfaces with Internet of Things ("IoT") connectivity as a standard feature, and integration with the KitchenConnect system for remote data analytics, proactive repair and maintenance, and equipment optimization.


• | Health and Sanitation: Manual sanitation of equipment in the restaurant has become a major challenge due to extended operating hours, the increasing pieces and complexity of equipment in kitchens, and competing demands from revenue producing tasks. For the cold product category, our High Efficiency Particulate Air filtration technology brings the cleanroom into the kitchen, controlling airborne contamination of ice machines. Electrically charged particles of water and UV light provide the basis for automated sterilization of food zones and contact surfaces in equipment. Compact steam generators are also being embedded in certain of our equipment, providing a proven technology for cleaning cooking cavities in our ovens.

-14-


• | Energy Efficiency: We are focused on increasing the efficiency of individual components and reducing standby energy losses. An example of reducing standby energy loss is the use of induction heating for holding pans so that energy is only used when a thermal load is present. We are also a leader in the area of high efficiency combustion systems with metal matrix burner technology. This technology reduces gas consumption and allows for variable firing rate. For cooking, natural refrigerants such as propane-based R-290 offer improved thermodynamic performance, and variable speed compressors and fans further increase overall cycle performance under partial load conditions.


• | Mobile Connectivity and Monitoring: Integration of mobile devices in kitchens is increasing rapidly, and will extend the user interface beyond the traditional boundaries of the equipment. Our KitchenConnect enabled products also include a system for equipment monitoring which collects data to reduce downtime, optimize energy use, and improve service response time. Furthermore, we are investing in a connectivity platform that will connect the kitchen, or "back of the house" to the dining room or the "front of the house". This will be augmented with competency in data analytics to convert data collected on our equipment into meaningful knowledge to maximize business impact.

In 2017, we introduced 22 new products, including significant upgrades (after 23 new product introductions in 2016) comprised of 11 hot-side products and 11 cold-side and beverage products. Some of these new products and upgrades include:

Distribution
We sell our foodservice equipment primarily through a worldwide network of over 3,500 distributors and dealers in over 100 countries ("direct customers") who ultimately sell to end customers and we sell spare parts through factory authorized service providers. 
In the Americas (U.S., Canada and Latin America), we have a broad portfolio of channel partners, covering all major foodservice market segments, including QSR chains, chained and independent casual and family dining restaurants, education, health care, business and industry, as well as the convenience and retail space. Our direct sales team is supplemented by a network of industry-leading Manufacture Representative Groups, providing national coverage. Direct sales team, sales representatives and distributors jointly serve independent equipment dealers with our full portfolio of food and beverage category brands. A dedicated strategic account team with culinary support is focused on the major U.S.-based restaurant chains, where we have significant global market share. Our teams work closely with our customers’ menu and equipment development teams to support their strategic plans. We also have distribution hubs in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
In EMEA, our distribution includes hubs in Herborn, Germany, serving countries in central and eastern Europe, in Guildford, England, serving countries in the United Kingdom and northern Europe, and in Barcelona, Spain serving countries in southern and western Europe. Each of these distribution centers operates a network of third-party dealers chosen to satisfy the requirements of both chain customers and independent caterers in their respective territories. Outside these countries, Welbilt products and services are sold through non-exclusive third-party distributors and service companies. In addition, our beverage customers receive specialist support from our beverage systems manufacturing facility in Halesowen, England.
We access the market in APAC through our dedicated distribution and dealer channel partners, most of them being established in the market for decades and having been Welbilt partners for over 15 years. 
Customers and Marketing
We serve some of the largest and most widely recognized multinational and regional businesses in the foodservice and hospitality industries. None of our end customers represented 10% or more of Welbilt net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. 
Our end customer base is comprised of a wide variety of foodservice providers, including large multinational and regional full-service restaurants as well as hotels and QSR chains, chained and independent casual and family dining restaurants, caterers; convenience and retail stores, lodging, resort, leisure and convention facilities; healthcare facilities; schools and universities; and many other foodservice outlets (collectively "end customers"). We differentiate ourselves from the competition through the ability to provide not only best-in-class food and

beverage equipment, but also entire and smart digitally enabled kitchen solutions designed to help our customers to improve productivity, quality and profitability. This allows us to provide one face to our customers for all our brands and is supported by world class culinary expertise and experienced key account management for our larger global chain customers. We support our sales efforts with a variety of marketing efforts including digital marketing, presence at foodservice shows, culinary events, trade-specific advertising and cooperative distributor merchandising.

Financial Information About Business Segments
Our products are sold in more than 100 countries. We report our operating results through three reportable segments: Americas, EMEA and APAC. All three reportable segments offer a broad range of hot and cold category foodservice products and solutions for customers in various end markets. 
Our broad portfolio of foodservice equipment and services provides us with a balanced, diverse revenue base across geographies and foodservice product categories. Approximately 40-45% of our revenues are derived from the sale of cold category products, 35-40% are from hot category products and approximately 15-20% from aftermarket parts and services. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated net sales of $1,445.4 million and earnings from operations of $219.1 million. Based on sales by destination in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the majority of our revenue was derived from customers in the Americas at approximately 72%, with 17% from EMEA customers and 11% from APAC customers, after giving effect to the elimination of intersegment sales.

Net sales by product class and the total measure of profit and loss for the last three fiscal years as well as the total assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is disclosed in Note 22, "Business Segments," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following table presents the relative percentages of net sales attributable to each reportable segment for each of the last three fiscal years:
 
 | For the years ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Americas | 80.7 | % | | 81.5 | % | 84.3 | % 
EMEA | 20.5 | % | | 19.7 | % | 17.9 | % 
APAC | 13.2 | % | | 13.1 | % | 12.2 | % 
Elimination of inter-segment sales | (14.4 | )% | | (14.3 | )% | (14.4 | )%

In the Americas, we provide foodservice equipment in over 30 countries and territories throughout North America and Latin America. Our Americas segment contributed net sales including intercompany sales of $1,166.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 80.7% of total Welbilt net sales before eliminations.
In EMEA, we provide foodservice equipment in over 50 countries throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa, including Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Our EMEA segment contributed net sales including intercompany sales of $296.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 20.5% of total Welbilt net sales before eliminations.

Our APAC segment contributed net sales including intercompany sales of $190.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 13.2% of total Welbilt net sales before eliminations.
Seasonality
Typically, the first quarter of our fiscal year represents the least favorable period for our financial results. Our customers are primarily in the northern hemisphere, and the warmer summer weather generally leads to an increase in construction and remodeling within the foodservice industry. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 5,400 people worldwide and had seven employee unions in North America, one trade union in Europe and one trade union in China. Many of our European employees belong to the trade union or a European works council. 
Raw Materials
We support our region-of-use production strategy with corresponding region-of-use supplier partners. The primary raw materials that we use are structural and rolled steel, aluminum, and copper. We also purchase electrical equipment and other semi- and fully-processed materials. We maintain inventories of steel and other purchased material. We have been successful in our goal to maintain alternative sources of raw materials and supplies, and therefore have not been dependent on a single source for any particular raw material or supply.
