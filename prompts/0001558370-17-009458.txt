 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 
 Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of specialty pharmaceutical products that leverage our broad experience with advanced transdermal and transmucosal delivery systems. We have multiple proprietary programs in preclinical and clinical development focusing primarily on the treatment of neurological disorders, with two lead programs in Alzheimer’s disease. We have developed and are the sole commercial manufacturer of seven prescription drug and consumer products for our marketing partners. We have two proprietary transdermal platforms: Corplex™ for small molecules and MicroCor®, a biodegradable microstructure technology for small molecules and biologics, including vaccines, peptides and proteins.  In addition to our proprietary Alzheimer’s program, our late-stage pipeline includes a contraceptive patch co-developed with Agile Therapeutics, or Agile, and additional transdermal products that are being developed with other partners.
 Transdermal drug delivery is the transport of drugs through the skin for absorption into the body. We believe our platforms offer significant competitive advantages over competing transdermal approaches. Corplex and MicroCor are designed to be adapted broadly for use in multiple drug categories and indications. We use our Corplex technology to create advanced transdermal and transmucosal systems for small molecules that:

· | utilize less of the active ingredient while achieving the same or better therapeutic effect,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | can deliver an active ingredient over a more prolonged period of time, resulting in less frequent dosing,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have the potential to improve the safety profile of small molecule drugs, particularly with respect to gastrointestinal, or GI, side effects,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | can adhere well to either wet or dry surfaces, and
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | can hold additional ingredients required to aid the diffusion of low‑solubility molecules through the skin without losing adhesion.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our MicroCor technology is a biodegradable microstructure system currently in development that enables the painless and convenient delivery of biologics that otherwise must be delivered via injection. 
 We have built significant know-how and experience in the development, scale-up and manufacture of complex specialty products, and have formed relationships with our partners that include both the development of new product formulations and our manufacture of the resulting products. Our partners include Mayne Pharma Inc., or Mayne, The Procter & Gamble Company, or P&G, Agile, and Aequus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Aequus, as well as other pharmaceutical companies. All of our current commercial products are distributed, promoted and marketed by our partners.

  In August 2016, Mayne acquired the commercial rights to the Clonidine Transdermal Delivery System, or Clonidine TDS, and the product-related agreements from Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., or Teva, as a result of a Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, consent order in which Teva agreed to divest the product in connection with Teva’s acquisition of the generic business of Allergan, plc, or Allergan. Mayne currently sells Clonidine TDS throughout the United States. The product was originally developed in 2004, and was commercially launched in 2010 by Teva.
 In March 2017, Mayne acquired the commercial rights to the Fentanyl TDS from Par Pharmaceuticals, or Par. Par had originally acquired the product as a result of an FTC-mandated divestiture of Fentanyl TDS from Actavis Inc., or Actavis, in connection with the merger of Actavis with Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Mayne currently sells Fentanyl TDS throughout the United States. We began the development of Fentanyl TDS in May 2002, and the product was commercially launched in 2007.
 Our partnership with P&G began in 2005 with the development of the various products under the Crest® Whitestrips label, the first of which P&G commercially launched in 2009. P&G currently sells Crest Whitestrips products globally.
 In addition to commercialized products, we have a number of product candidates in late stages of development. One of these products is Twirla®, which is an investigational combination hormonal contraceptive transdermal patch designed to deliver two hormones, ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, at levels comparable to low-dose oral contraceptives over seven days. We are the exclusive manufacturer of this product for Agile. 
 In January 2017, Agile announced top-line data from a completed Phase 3 clinical trial. Agile had initiated this trial after receipt of a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA in February 2013 in response to Agile’s previous New Drug Application, or NDA, filing in April 2012. As recommended by the FDA in the February 2013 CRL, Agile conducted a third Phase 3 clinical trial which was completed in 2016. In June 2017, Agile resubmitted its NDA with the results of the additional Phase 3 clinical trial and, in July 2017, the FDA notified Agile of its acceptance of the resubmitted NDA for review.  Agile’s Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date for this resubmission was December 26, 2017.  On December 22, 2017, Agile disclosed that the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter in response to the resubmission of their NDA, which stated that the FDA could not approve Agile’s NDA in its current form. Agile further disclosed that the CRL identified deficiencies relating to quality adhesion test methods, the need for Agile to address whether the in vivo adhesion properties of Twirla may have contributed to the SECURE Phase 3 clinical trial results, and also stated that the observations noted during an FDA inspection of our facility must be resolved. The CRL also recommended that Agile address the implications of clinical trial subject patch compliance and the withdrawal and dropout rates. Agile disclosed that they had submitted an amendment to their NDA on December 1, 2017 in response to an information request from the FDA on the issues related to the quality adhesion test methods cited in the CRL, and further disclosed that the CRL acknowledged receipt of the Agile NDA amendment and stated that the amendment was not reviewed prior to the FDA's action.  In addition, on November 20, 2017 and December 1, 2017, we provided the FDA responses addressing each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection.

 Agile has also disclosed that it intends to request a meeting with the FDA as soon as possible to discuss the points raised in the CRL and a path to approval for Twirla. We are working closely with Agile to address the non-clinical issues raised in the CRL as quickly as possible.
 We are developing several additional products utilizing our Corplex technology, some of which we advanced into human clinical trials during 2015 and 2016. Our two lead central nervous system product candidates are for the transdermal treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and incorporate the two most commonly-prescribed drugs already approved by the FDA for this disease: donepezil and memantine. 
 Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder in which the brain cells degenerate and die, causing a steady decline in memory and mental function. An estimated 5.5 million Americans suffered from Alzheimer's disease in 2017 and, by 2025, this number is estimated to reach 7.1 million. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia among older adults.  Dementia ranges in severity from mild, when it is just beginning to affect a person's functioning, to moderate, and severe, when the person must depend on others for the basic activities of day-to-day life.
 Donepezil (the active ingredient in Aricept®) is the most widely-prescribed medication in a class of Alzheimer's drugs known as cholinesterase inhibitors, and is approved for the treatment of mild, moderate and severe disease. Donepezil is currently only available in tablet or orally disintegrating tablet form, each administered once daily, presenting compliance challenges for family members and caregivers who cannot rely on patients to consistently take their daily tablets, and is known to cause gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite.
 Memantine (the active ingredient in Namenda®) is one of the most widely-prescribed medications for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.  Memantine is the only FDA-approved N-methyl-D-aspartate, or NMDA,-receptor antagonist for use in Alzheimer’s and works by regulating the activity of glutamate, a neurotransmitter in the brain involved in learning and memory.  Memantine is currently only available in once- and twice-daily oral dosage forms. As with donepezil, this presents compliance challenges for family members and caregivers who cannot rely on patients to consistently take their daily oral medications.
 Our donepezil and memantine product candidates first entered into Phase 1 clinical trials in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, and we announced positive results for several donepezil and memantine clinical trials in fiscal 2016. In April 2016, we received positive feedback from the FDA on our pre-Investigational New Drug, or pre-IND, submission that outlined our proposed 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for Corplex Donepezil based on a demonstration of bioequivalence, or BE. Specifically, the FDA advised us that if we can adequately demonstrate bioequivalence between Corplex Donepezil and oral Aricept in our planned bioequivalence studies, additional clinical efficacy studies would not be required. Bioequivalence clinical studies are designed to assess the biological equivalence of pharmaceutical products based on their pharmacokinetic, or PK, profiles, and are generally performed in healthy subjects. These studies are relatively short in duration and provide a development path that is generally less costly and more streamlined than typical clinical development programs, which require studies demonstrating safety and efficacy in patients.  
 Additionally, in August 2016, after review of our pre-IND submission of Corplex Memantine, the FDA concurred with our development plans for this product, including our proposal for a pivotal study based on the demonstration of bioequivalence between the Corplex Memantine and oral Namenda XR® extended release capsules.
 In the fourth calendar quarter of fiscal 2016, we initiated our pilot bioequivalence study for Corplex Donepezil, and we completed the study in April 2017. The pilot bioequivalence study was a six-month, three-period, randomized crossover study comparing the steady-state PK profiles of once-daily oral Aricept with two Corplex Donepezil transdermal patches that differed only in size. Based on the results of our earlier one-week Phase 1 PK study comparing Corplex Donepezil with oral Aricept®, we projected that at steady state, the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the curve of plasma concentration of donepezil with the Corplex patch over the course of a week would be similar to the same measurements of oral Aricept. Data from the pilot BE study demonstrated that the smaller of the two Corplex Donepezil product candidates successfully met the statistical criteria for bioequivalence to oral Aricept based on the primary PK parameters of maximum plasma concentration at steady state, or Cmax, and area under the curve at steady state, or AUC, previously established with the FDA. Both Corplex transdermal treatments were well tolerated, with favorable adhesion, skin safety and gastrointestinal side effect profiles after application of over 500 patches in the

course of the study. For example, the incidence of treatment-related nausea in subjects on the smaller patch was more than six-fold lower than the incidence of nausea with oral Aricept. In August 2017, we held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in which we reviewed the results from the pilot BE study.  The FDA confirmed the choice of PK parameters and statistical testing approaches for the BE study and also confirmed our design of the planned supportive studies and other requirements for product registration.  The FDA also indicated that it would consider whether the pilot study could serve as the pivotal study and we have provided additional data requested by the FDA for this purpose. However, since we are uncertain as to the length of that review, we initiated dosing of our pivotal BE study for Corplex Donepezil in October 2017. The design of the pivotal BE study is similar to the pilot study and is a single center, randomized, multiple dose, two-way crossover study in healthy volunteers, conducted at the same site as the pilot BE study. Dosing in the first treatment period was completed in December, with topline results expected in the first half of calendar 2018. We are targeting submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for this product candidate in the fourth quarter of calendar 2018.
 We are currently focusing our resources and clinical development efforts on Corplex Donepezil, the highest priority of our proprietary programs, and plan to defer the next stage of clinical trials for our other proprietary programs, including Corplex Memantine, pending further progress on our donepezil program. We anticipate following the same bioequivalence-based development pathway for Corplex Memantine that we are following for Corplex Donepezil.  In addition, we continue to perform preclinical development work on other proprietary pipeline products with a primary focus on developing innovative products for treatment of central nervous system diseases.
 In April 2015, we entered into an agreement with Aequus to develop new transdermal products with an initial focus on neurological and psychiatric disorders. The first project under this collaboration is a multi-day transdermal formulation of aripiprazole, a drug already approved by the FDA for the treatment of a variety of psychiatric conditions. Aequus reported positive results from a single dose Phase 1 bioavailability clinical trial in the first calendar quarter of 2016 and, in April 2017, announced positive results from a follow-up repeat dose 28-day study to evaluate the bioavailability and safety of this product candidate.
 We routinely enter into other feasibility and development agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies involving our Corplex and MicroCor technologies.
 Transdermal Drug Delivery Industry  
 Patients have benefited from the use of transdermal delivery systems since the first commercially approved transdermal product, ALZA Corporation’s Transderm Scop for the prevention of motion sickness, was approved in 1979. To date, we are aware of approximately 20 drugs that have been successfully formulated and approved by the FDA for delivery in transdermal patches. According to Transdermal Drug Delivery Market & Clinical Pipeline Insight in a report dated May 2014, the global value of the market for systemic transdermal products, including patches, was approximately $25 billion in 2013 and is expected to grow to approximately $40 billion by 2018. We believe that growth of this market is driven by the increasing availability of transdermal systems for important therapeutic applications and changing disease demographics.
 Transdermal delivery and transmucosal delivery, or delivery through mucous membranes, offer patients more convenient, non‑invasive and comfortable methods of drug delivery. The benefits of transdermal and transmucosal delivery systems over other dosage forms generally include enhancing the efficacy and reducing the side effects of a drug by controlling the rate of delivery and absorption, avoiding the undesirable breakdown of drugs in the liver associated with gastrointestinal absorption, reducing or eliminating gastrointestinal side effects related to local drug effects within the GI tract, and improving the level of patient compliance and long‑term adherence to therapy.
 Despite the benefits of current transdermal delivery products, many key challenges prevent broader use and applicability:

· | Skin Irritation and Adhesion: A number of patches cause skin irritation and sensitization, often brought on by the inclusion of skin‑permeating ingredients necessary to overcome the limitations of traditional patch 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

technologies. Some patches also experience adhesion failure resulting from excess moisture or heat while worn by the patient, for example when swimming, bathing or during other normal daily activities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Safety and Drug Loading: In order to enable effective diffusion of sufficient amounts of drug through the skin, many transdermal delivery systems must incorporate large amounts of drug in the patch. After use, a large residual amount of the drug remains and must be disposed of carefully, especially if the drug is potent or toxic. In some cases, only a small amount of the total drug loaded in a patch is actually delivered into the bloodstream. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Delivery Limitation: The pharmaceutical industry has been unable to formulate certain drugs for transdermal drug delivery, particularly small molecules that are not soluble in water or are unstable in the presence of air or water. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  One of the greatest opportunities in transdermal drug delivery is the ability to deliver biologics, including vaccines, peptides and proteins, without the use of an injection. A number of companies have attempted to develop technologies to address this challenge, but many have experienced commercial and development failures due to the formulation, scale‑up and manufacturing complexities. Some of these systems have relied upon large, complex and costly devices, usually with external power sources, which adversely impact their usability and reproducibility.
 We are developing and commercializing advanced transdermal drug delivery products that are intended to expand the number and types of drugs that can be delivered transdermally. We believe our technologies can be applied to improve the therapeutic value of many drugs by controlling the levels of drug delivered over a longer period of time. They are also designed to eliminate the need for injections of certain drugs and to improve adhesion and skin irritation profiles. Our technologies also allow us to create cost‑effective products, especially by eliminating the need for complex devices and refrigeration throughout the supply chain. Our two proprietary platforms, Corplex and MicroCor, separately address some of the primary shortcomings of traditional transdermal drug delivery. We believe our track record within the industry demonstrates our ability to develop commercially successful products.
 Corplex Technology
 Corplex is a novel technology incorporating combinations of materials that utilize the properties of both traditional pressure‑sensitive adhesives, or PSAs, as well as bioadhesives, to enable the transdermal delivery of small molecules. Corplex encompasses combinations and blends of polymers to provide a range of properties that improve adhesion and delivery of active ingredients that may otherwise be difficult to formulate for transdermal delivery. We use our Corplex technology in the Crest Whitestrips products and in several of our therapeutic products in development, including our Corplex Donepezil and Corplex Memantine products. Our Corplex transdermal delivery systems provide advanced custom solutions for small molecules and feature the following benefits:
· | Flexibility: Corplex is adaptable and provides the ability to formulate adhesives to complement a drug’s unique properties, enabling new drug dosage forms and delivery options. As a result, Corplex systems can be formulated in several dosage forms ranging from liquids (sprays, film‑forming liquids), to semi‑solids (gels, creams and ointments) to solids (powders, particles, dry and wet films, and patches). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ease‑of‑Use: Our Corplex systems are designed to improve patient compliance by being easy to use and providing more convenient dosing regimens. In addition, Corplex products are suitable for long‑term skin contact and are designed to be easily removed with minimal damage to skin and without leaving a residue. Corplex incorporates unique compositions and blends of polymers to provide a range of hydrophilic to hydrophobic properties, enabling excellent adhesion to both dry and wet surfaces with a variety of wear times, ranging from seconds to up to seven days. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Compatibility: Corplex can incorporate liquid‑based components that improve stability and diffusion of the drug without compromising adhesion. As a result, Corplex is compatible with many chemically diverse drugs, including compounds that are highly soluble or highly insoluble in water, as well as a wide range of 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

solubilizing agents and enhancers that enable the delivery of these molecules, thereby expanding the universe of drugs that can be delivered transdermally.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Efficient and Controlled Drug Delivery: Because Corplex enables drugs to diffuse more easily through the skin, we can design Corplex products to require less drug to achieve the desired therapeutic result. Additionally, Corplex allows for development of products with drug delivery profiles ranging from immediate release to sustained release or a combination of fast‑acting and long‑lasting types of release. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved Therapeutic Profile: By achieving a steady dosage level, Corplex systems are designed to minimize side effects that otherwise result from peak concentrations of the drug when delivered with oral or other dosage forms. Transdermal drug delivery can also minimize or eliminate gastrointestinal side effects due to local drug effects in the GI tract. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved User Experience: Corplex allows us to minimize the use of ingredients that can cause skin irritation and sensitization, two of the most common side effects of transdermal drug delivery. In our Corplex systems, we use materials that are well established for use in medical products by the FDA. In some cases, patches can be thinner, more flexible or smaller than conventional patches, reducing costs and improving the user experience. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We believe the combination of these benefits make Corplex well‑suited for the development of a variety of healthcare products that require adhesive properties. Our primary focus is on developing prescription transdermal drug products, with an emphasis on chronic central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, where the goal of therapy is to maintain consistent blood levels of therapeutic agents over months or years and the nature of the disease makes compliance with daily oral medications particularly problematic.
 MicroCor Technology
 MicroCor is a biodegradable microstructure patch technology that we are developing to enable transdermal delivery of biologics, in a disruptive platform that reduces the need for needles and syringes and enables global distribution of biologics without requiring refrigeration. Because biologics cannot diffuse through the skin due to their size, some mechanism is required to introduce these molecules beyond the outer layer of the skin, or stratum corneum, where they can be absorbed into the body. The further a delivery system penetrates beyond the stratum corneum, the more likely it is to cause pain, bleeding and bruising. By integrating active ingredients directly into arrays of biodegradable microstructures, our MicroCor technology is designed to penetrate only the stratum corneum to release the drug for local or systemic absorption, while eliminating the pain, bleeding and bruising that can be caused by needles and other active delivery devices.
 We believe MicroCor will offer the following advantages over other delivery technologies in development for biologics:

· | Minimal Discomfort: Our MicroCor systems feature an array of microstructures that penetrate the stratum corneum to only a few hundred microns in depth, deep enough for effective delivery without causing pain, bruising or bleeding. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Dose Sparing: MicroCor needles are biodegradable and dissolve in the skin once the system is applied. Our clinical studies to date demonstrate a high degree of efficiency in the delivery of active ingredients using the MicroCor system. We expect our MicroCor systems to reduce drug waste and the costs associated with the excess drug that may be required in less efficient delivery technologies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Thermally Stable: Our MicroCor systems do not contain moisture, and therefore are designed to be room temperature stable, enabling both stockpiling and worldwide delivery without refrigeration, thereby minimizing drug or product spoilage. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  8

 


· | No Biohazard Disposal: Because MicroCor needles completely dissolve in the skin, no sharps remain after use. We believe this feature will allow disposal of the system in a traditional trash receptacle without risk of accidental needle sticks or abuse associated with residual drug left in the delivery system. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ease‑of‑Use: MicroCor products are designed to be self‑administered, fully‑integrated, single‑use systems that are worn for only a few minutes. Unlike other delivery systems, MicroCor requires no additional parts, electrical power or complex external enabling devices to effectively deliver the drug or product. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cost‑Effective: In addition to the cost savings associated with dose sparing and thermal stability, MicroCor’s fundamental design and our proprietary molding process also has the potential to minimize costs associated with manufacturing MicroCor systems. We expect our processes may allow us to reduce waste of raw materials used in manufacturing, as compared to needle coating processes used by other microneedle-based delivery technologies for large molecules. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Material Relationships
 Our partners are critical to our success. We currently have material relationships with the following companies, as well as earlier‑stage relationships with a number of other companies. This diversified mix of partnerships provides multiple potential sources of revenue growth in the future. In each of fiscal 2017 and 2016, we derived nearly all of our revenues from our partners Mayne/Teva, Endo/Par, P&G and Agile. In fiscal 2017, we received $7.0 million of our revenues from Mayne, $16.8 million from P&G, and $5.8 million from Agile, or 22%, 53%, and 18%, respectively. In fiscal 2016, we received $7.4 million from Mayne/Teva, $6.6 million from Endo/Par and $13.9 million of our revenues from P&G, or 22%, 20% and 42% of our revenues, respectively. Mayne Pharma, Inc./Teva Pharmaceuticals, USA Inc.
 In 2004, we entered into a development, manufacturing and commercialization agreement with Barr Laboratories, Inc., or Barr, for four generic transdermal drug products. We entered into three separate agreements with Barr, one in 2006 and two in 2007, to develop and commercialize additional Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA transdermal patch products. In 2008, Teva acquired Barr. Following this acquisition and its review of resource allocations and potential conflicts, Teva continued three of these development programs, including Clonidine TDS, a urology patch approved in March 2014 and a motion sickness patch. In August 2016, Teva transferred Clonidine TDS and the agreements related to this product to Mayne as a result of an FTC consent order in which Teva agreed to divest the product in connection with Teva’s acquisition of the generic business of Allergan. Mayne currently sells Clonidine TDS throughout the United States. In December 2016, Teva assigned to Mayne the agreements and rights to the motion sickness patch, which is currently the subject of a pending ANDA. 
 In March 2017, Mayne acquired the commercial rights to Fentanyl TDS from Par Pharmaceutical, or Par. Mayne currently sells Fentanyl TDS throughout the United States. For more information on Fentanyl, please see “Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc./Par Pharmaceutical, Inc.” below.
 Under our agreements with Mayne, we are the exclusive supplier of the Clonidine TDS product that we developed. We received compensation for developing the product, and we receive a manufacturing margin, expressed as a margin above costs, and a profit share based on Mayne’s net profits on the products. Mayne has an exclusive license to use certain of our intellectual property to the extent necessary to commercialize, make, use or sell the ANDA products that are the subject of their respective agreements.
 The contract for Clonidine and the motion sickness patch extend for ten years beyond the respective product launch dates, with provisions for automatic annual renewal thereafter. Each contract may be terminated, with three months’ notice before the end of a renewal period, or for uncured material breach, bankruptcy, or certain conditions preceding ANDA filing. If any of these agreements were to be terminated, Mayne would be required to obtain FDA approval for an alternate manufacturing site before they could obtain additional supply of the relevant product, a process that generally takes two years or more.

 In addition to contract research and development revenues and product revenues, from the inception of our collaborations with Teva and its predecessor, we have received no license fees and $0.2 million in milestone payments. Similarly, other than contract research and development revenues, we have received no license fees or milestone payments from Mayne. Under our current agreements, we are not eligible for additional milestone payments from Mayne. We also receive a profit share equal to a low tens percentage of Mayne’s net sales of Clonidine TDS, after deducting certain selling‑related expenses. 
 Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc./Par Pharmaceutical, Inc.
 In 2002, we entered into a product development, collaboration and license agreement and in 2003 we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Abrika LLLP for a generic equivalent of Duragesic, a fentanyl transdermal product marketed by Johnson & Johnson. In 2007, Abrika was acquired by Actavis, Inc. In 2007, the FDA approved and Actavis launched our Fentanyl TDS product. In 2012, Par, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Endo since 2015, acquired the fentanyl business from Actavis as a result of an FTC-mandated divestiture of Fentanyl TDS from Actavis in connection with the merger of Actavis with Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   In March 2017, Mayne acquired the commercial rights to Fentanyl TDS from Par.
 Abrika and Actavis paid us for the development of Fentanyl TDS and we also received a manufacturing margin and have historically been paid a royalty on net sales of the products by Par. The 2002 agreement may be terminated for uncured material breach, bankruptcy, or certain conditions preceding ANDA filing. If Mayne, who acquired the product from Par, were to terminate the agreement, it would be required to obtain FDA approval for an alternate manufacturing site before it could obtain additional supply of the product, a process that generally takes two years or more. On June 26, 2015, we amended our agreements with Par, consisting of the Product Development, Collaboration and License Agreement and the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement for Transdermal Fentanyl, to amend the pricing and payment provisions and other business terms in exchange for, among other things, the termination of Par’s exclusive rights to products other than the fentanyl reservoir patch that was being manufactured by us for Par, which is an AB-rated generic equivalent to DURAGESIC®. The amended terms also eliminated the royalty obligations and established mutually agreeable transfer pricing. The term of our Manufacturing and Supply Agreement for Fentanyl TDS ends on November 12, 2023. The Product Development, Collaboration and License Agreement does not have a fixed expiration date, but it is no longer active as there are no outstanding performance obligations by either party under that agreement.
 In addition to contract research and development revenues and product revenues, from the inception of our collaborations with Endo/Par and its predecessors and assignee, Mayne, we have received no license fees and $0.5 million in milestone payments from Par.
 The Procter & Gamble Company 
 In June 2005, we entered into a multi‑faceted strategic arrangement with P&G, one of the largest consumer products companies in the world. Our relationship includes a worldwide license to P&G for the use of our Corplex technology in products in the oral care field. P&G paid us fees for the license, and agreed to pay additional future milestone payments for products that we develop for P&G. In addition, we entered into a long term joint development agreement under which we perform numerous research and development activities for P&G based upon agreed‑upon statements of work and budgets.
 We have developed and commercialized five oral care products for P&G sold under the brand name Crest Whitestrips. We have developed all of these products under the joint development agreement and are currently supplying each product in an intermediate (as opposed to final packaging) stage to P&G. The term of the joint development agreement ends on June 13, 2020.  We or P&G may terminate the joint development agreement in the event of a material default by the other party, and P&G may terminate the joint development agreement for convenience.
 We also have a commercial supply agreement in place, under which we are responsible for the production and supply to P&G of the five oral care products. Under the terms of the agreement, we are the exclusive supplier to P&G for the Crest Whitestrips products that use our Corplex technology and the agreement can be expanded to include any additional products that move into commercial supply. We entered into our current supply agreement in April 2017 and

the term of the agreement ends in March 2022. We or P&G may terminate the supply agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach. We believe that we have unique capabilities and know‑how related to the manufacture of Corplex‑based Crest Whitestrips, which we believe would be difficult for another party to duplicate.
 In addition to contract research and development and product revenues, from the inception of our collaborations with P&G, we have received a total of $3.2 million in license fees and $3.6 million in milestone payments from P&G. In 2008, we received a $2.0 million milestone payment for the first series of products developed by us. In fiscal 2016, we received a $1.1 million milestone payment from P&G for the approval of the U.S. commercial launch of a product developed by us. In 2015, we received a $0.5 million milestone payment for the launch of the same product outside of the United States. P&G's license from us is perpetual and irrevocable. None of our arrangements with P&G require a royalty to be paid to us.
 Agile Therapeutics, Inc.
 In 2006, we entered into a development, license and commercialization agreement with Agile, a company that focuses on development of women’s healthcare products. As part of our relationship, we are the exclusive supplier of Twirla, a combined hormonal contraceptive patch, which was designed by Agile using its formulation technology and is proprietary to Agile. Under our agreement with Agile, we have performed substantial work, funded by Agile, on the process development and scale‑up of the manufacturing process for Twirla, and we have manufactured the product for each of Agile’s clinical trials. We are also working with Agile under this agreement on development of a “small patch” variation on the Twirla product. Our agreement also includes an additional Agile product, AG890, which is a progestin‑only contraceptive patch in Phase 2 of clinical development.
 We have worked in partnership with Agile to prepare facilities and equipment at our Grand Rapids manufacturing site for approval and commercial production of the product. The primary production equipment specifically designed for manufacture of this product is in place and is owned by Agile, and we are responsible for operating and maintaining that equipment.
 Our exclusive right to manufacture Twirla and AG890 extends until we have commercially produced an agreed‑upon quantity of patches, currently projected to occur no earlier than five years following commercial launch of Twirla. The contract may be terminated for uncured material breach. Following the end of the exclusivity period, if Agile were to seek a second source of supply, Agile would be required to obtain FDA approval for an additional manufacturing site, a process that generally takes two years or more, and make substantial investments in new facilities and equipment.
 In addition to contract research and development revenues, from the inception of our collaborations with Agile, we have received no license fees and $3.5 million in milestone payments from Agile. We are not currently eligible for any future milestone payments, and the terms of our supply agreement do not entitle us to receive a royalty.
 Products and Pipeline
 We have seven commercial products and two products awaiting FDA approval, and we are developing additional undisclosed prescription drug products with partners. We also routinely enter into feasibility agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies involving our Corplex and MicroCor technologies.   Marketed Products:
 In fiscal 2017, we received a total of $22.4 million in product revenues from our three marketed products: $3.7 million from Clonidine TDS, $2.2 million from Fentanyl TDS, and $16.5 million from Crest Whitestrips, representing 16%, 10% and 74% of total product revenues, respectively.
 Clonidine TDS is a treatment for hypertension that we developed under an ANDA as a generic version of the branded drug known as Catapres-TTS®. Clonidine TDS was launched in 2010 by Teva and is now marketed by Mayne, following an FTC-mandated divestiture, and is manufactured by us exclusively for Mayne.

 Fentanyl TDS is a treatment for management of chronic pain, including cancer‑related pain, under specified conditions. We developed this product for approval under an ANDA as a generic version of the branded product known as Duragesic. Our Fentanyl TDS was approved in 2007 and is currently marketed by Mayne and manufactured by us exclusively for Mayne.
 Crest Whitestrips are a series of five products for oral care that we co‑developed with P&G as part of a broad relationship relating to oral care products. These products utilize our Corplex polymer technology and are sold under the Crest Whitestrips brand. We are the sole supplier of the oral care system for P&G.
 Proprietary Pipeline Products:
 Corplex Donepezil and Corplex Memantine are being developed as once-weekly transdermal patches for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and are designed to provide consistent and sustained blood levels of the relevant therapeutic agent, while improving patient adherence and compliance.  Corplex Donepezil has the added benefit of potentially decreasing the rate of gastrointestinal side effects seen with existing oral formulations, such as nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. 
 Donepezil (the active ingredient in Aricept®) is the most widely-prescribed medication in a class of Alzheimer's drugs known as cholinesterase inhibitors, and is approved for the treatment of mild, moderate and severe disease. Donepezil is currently only available in tablet or orally disintegrating tablet form, each administered once daily, presenting compliance challenges for family members and caregivers who cannot rely on patients to consistently take their daily tablets, and is known to cause gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite.
 Memantine (the active ingredient in Namenda®) is one of the most widely-prescribed medications for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.  Memantine is the only FDA-approved N-methyl-D-aspartate, or NMDA-receptor antagonist for use in Alzheimer’s and works by regulating the activity of glutamate, a neurotransmitter in the brain involved in learning and memory. Memantine is currently only available in once- and twice-daily oral dosage forms. As with donepezil, this presents compliance challenges for family members and caregivers who cannot rely on patients to consistently take their oral medications.
 Our donepezil and memantine candidates first entered into Phase 1 clinical trials in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, and we announced successful results for several donepezil and memantine clinical trials throughout fiscal 2016. In April 2016, we received positive feedback from the FDA on our pre-IND submission that outlined our proposed 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for Corplex Donepezil based solely on a demonstration of bioequivalence. Bioequivalence clinical studies are designed to assess the biological equivalence of pharmaceutical products based on their PK profiles, and are generally performed in healthy subjects.  These studies are relatively short in duration and provide a development path that is substantially less costly and more streamlined than typical clinical development programs, which require studies demonstrating safety and efficacy. Following review of our pre-IND submission, the FDA provided clear guidance on our development plans and registration pathway. The agency advised us that if we can adequately demonstrate bioequivalence between Corplex Donepezil and oral Aricept in our planned PK bioequivalence studies, additional clinical efficacy studies would not be required.  
 Additionally, in August 2016, after review of our pre-IND submission of Corplex Memantine, the FDA concurred with our development plans for this product, including our proposal for pivotal studies based on the demonstration of bioequivalence between the Corplex Memantine and oral Namenda XR® extended release capsules.
 In September 2016, we filed an Investigational New Drug, or IND, Application for Corplex Donepezil following completion of required nonclinical studies. The FDA notified us in October 2016 that we may proceed with our planned bioequivalence testing, and we initiated a pilot bioequivalence study in the United States during the fourth calendar quarter of 2016. This study evaluated steady state blood levels of once-weekly Corplex Donepezil using two different patch sizes compared to 10mg per day of oral Aricept in healthy volunteers.  Data from the pilot study demonstrated that the smaller of the two Corplex Donepezil product candidates successfully met the statistical criteria for bioequivalence to oral Aricept using the primary PK parameters of maximum plasma concentration at steady state, or Cmax, and area under the curve at steady state, or AUC, previously established with the FDA. Both Corplex transdermal

treatments were well tolerated, with favorable adhesion, skin safety and gastrointestinal side effect profiles after application of over 500 patches in the course of the study. In August 2017, we held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in which we reviewed the results from the pilot BE trial.  The FDA confirmed the choice of PK parameters and statistical testing approaches for the BE study and also confirmed our design of the planned supportive studies and other requirements for product registration. The FDA also indicated that it would consider whether the pilot study could serve as the pivotal study and we have provided additional data requested by the FDA for this purpose. However, since we are uncertain as to the length of that review, we initiated dosing of our pivotal BE study for Corplex Donepezil in October 2017.  The design of the pivotal BE study is similar to the pilot study and is a single center, randomized, multiple dose, two-way crossover study in healthy volunteers, conducted at the same site as the pilot BE study.  The first treatment period will be complete in December, with topline results expected in the first half of calendar 2018. We are targeting submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for this product candidate in the fourth quarter of calendar 2018.
 Corplex Ropinirole is designed as a once-weekly transdermal patch for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease and many Parkinson’s patients have trouble swallowing pills. Approximately one million people in the United States and over ten million people worldwide suffer from this disease, which is commonly treated with dopamine replacement therapies such as levodopa and dopamine agonists that mimic the action of dopamine. We have performed preclinical development work on a transdermal formulation of ropinirole, a proven and FDA-approved dopamine agonist for treating Parkinson’s disease. We anticipate developing this patch under a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which we believe will allow for reduced nonclinical and clinical study cost and time. 
 MicroCor hPTH(1‑34) is a transdermal system designed to use our MicroCor technology to provide simplified delivery of parathyroid hormone, the active ingredient of Forteo®, an injectable product marketed by Eli Lilly and Company for the treatment of severe osteoporosis. hPTH(1‑34) is a shortened version of the naturally occurring parathyroid hormone that promotes bone growth.
 We have completed Phase 1 and Phase 2a clinical studies of MicroCor hPTH(1‑34) in healthy women. In these studies, MicroCor hPTH(1‑34) was shown to be safe and well tolerated with comparable drug exposure to that achieved with the commercially available subcutaneous injections. The product achieved rapid systemic delivery of hPTH with a short wear time of five minutes. We reported successful, interim Phase 2a results in July 2015. Although we have self-funded Phase 1 and Phase 2a clinical trials for MicroCor hPTH(1‑34), further development is dependent on securing a partner-funded agreement.  
 We have in place facilities for manufacture of MicroCor products for early clinical testing. We have developed an aseptic manufacturing plan for large scale manufacturing, which would be required for Phase 3 and commercial production of any MicroCor products.
 Feasibility Programs include self-funded and partner‑funded feasibility programs that we have completed or are currently in progress. Our self-funded programs are focused primarily on central nervous system indications. In our partner-funded programs performed to date, we have collaborated with leading biopharmaceutical companies to formulate their proprietary active molecules in our Corplex and MicroCor technologies and demonstrate delivery of the drug in animal models. 
 Partnered Pipeline Products:
 Twirla is a combination hormonal contraceptive patch that contains the active ingredients ethinyl estradiol (an estrogen) and levonorgestrel (a progestin), both of which have an established history of efficacy and safety in currently marketed combination contraceptives. Twirla is designed to deliver both hormones at levels comparable to low‑dose oral contraceptives. By delivering these active ingredients over seven days, this product is designed to promote enhanced compliance by patients with a convenient, easy‑to‑use format. The patch is applied once weekly for three weeks, followed by a week without a patch. The product, which was designed by Agile and for which we have done process development and manufacturing, will, if approved, be packaged with three patches per carton to provide a cycle (month) of therapy. We are the exclusive manufacturer of this product for Agile.

 In January 2017, Agile announced top-line data from a completed Phase 3 clinical trial. Agile had initiated this trial after receipt of a CRL from the FDA in February 2013 in response to Agile’s previous NDA filing in April 2012. As recommended by the FDA in the February 2013 CRL, Agile conducted a third Phase 3 clinical trial which was completed in 2016. In June 2017, Agile resubmitted its NDA with the results of the additional Phase 3 clinical trial and, in July 2017, the FDA notified Agile of its acceptance of the resubmitted NDA for review. Agile’s PDUFA goal date for this resubmission was December 26, 2017.  On December 22, 2017, Agile disclosed that the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter in response to the resubmission of their NDA, which stated that the FDA could not approve Agile’s NDA in its current form. Agile further disclosed that the CRL identified deficiencies relating to quality adhesion test methods, the need for Agile to address whether the in vivo adhesion properties of Twirla may have contributed to the SECURE Phase 3 clinical trial results, and also stated that the observations noted during an FDA inspection of our facility must be resolved.  The CRL also recommended that Agile address the implications of clinical trial subject patch compliance and the withdrawal and dropout rates. Agile disclosed that they had submitted an amendment to their NDA on December 1, 2017 in response to an information request from the FDA on the issues related to the quality adhesion test methods cited in the CRL, and further disclosed that the CRL acknowledged receipt of the Agile NDA amendment and stated that the amendment was not reviewed prior to the FDA's action.  In addition, on November 20, 2017 and December 1, 2017, we provided the FDA responses addressing each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection.
 Agile has also disclosed that it intends to request a meeting with the FDA as soon as possible to discuss the points raised in the CRL and a path to approval for Twirla. We are working closely with Agile to address the non-clinical issues raised in the CRL as quickly as possible.
 Motion Sickness Patch. We have developed a three-day generic transdermal product for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness in collaboration with Mayne, who acquired the product from Teva. This product is currently the subject of a pending ANDA. 
 In April 2015, we entered into an agreement with Aequus to develop new transdermal products with an initial focus on neurological and psychiatric disorders. The first project under this collaboration is a multi-day transdermal formulation of aripiprazole, a drug already approved by the FDA for the treatment of a variety of psychiatric conditions. Aequus reported positive results from a single dose Phase 1 bioavailability clinical trial in the first calendar quarter of 2016 and in April 2017 announced positive results from a follow-up repeat dose 28-day study to evaluate the bioavailability and safety of this product candidate.
 Research and Development
 Our research and development operations are located in a 25,000 square foot laboratory and office facility in Menlo Park, California that is configured for transdermal and transmucosal systems development. We conduct proprietary drug delivery research utilizing our extensive experience in polymer blending, formulations and system engineering to produce innovative products with high drug delivery efficiency. Our research and development team has full early product development capabilities, including:
· | Formulation, system design and engineering;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Analytical method development and validations;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | Prototyping and pilot manufacturing;
--+-------------------------------------


· | Early stage quality assurance and quality control;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | Nonclinical and early stage clinical development; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Regulatory affairs.
--+--------------------

 In addition, our Menlo Park site operates a facility capable of making products in accordance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements for certain Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies.
 Our Menlo Park research and development team includes 29 scientists and engineers, some of whom were original inventors of transdermal patches. We perform the formulation system design, analytical method development and prototyping for all of our transdermal products. Our research and development team works in collaboration with the process scale‑up team in our manufacturing operations early in the product development cycle. This early coordination helps assure streamlined technology transfer success in the final scale‑up and commercial manufacture of each product, leading to more robust development programs and greater manufacturing efficiencies.
 Manufacturing
 Our commercial manufacturing facilities are located in Grand Rapids, Michigan in three buildings comprising approximately 200,000 square feet. We have a full range of development and manufacturing capabilities, from complete process development and scale‑up services to commercial manufacture. We have made significant investments in our manufacturing technology that allow us to automate many of our processes and maximize the productivity of our labor force. We employ multiple manufacturing techniques, including solvent cast and extrusion manufacturing processes that minimize the thickness of our patches and reduce the costs of our products. Solvent casting is well‑suited for manufacturing films containing heat‑sensitive molecules because the temperatures required to remove the solvents are relatively low compared to those needed for a hot‑melt extrusion process. Hot‑melt extrusion is not suitable for ingredients that could be thermally degraded in the process, but is environmentally friendly, cost effective and more flexible than solvent cast‑only processes.
 Our manufacturing platform includes:

· | Process development and scale-up;
--+----------------------------------


· | Prototype, pilot, and commercial manufacturing;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | Primary, secondary and tertiary packaging;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | Liquid compounding using hazardous solvents and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Twin screw extrusion and mixer-extrusion capabilities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | High speed, high accuracy die cutting and customization (including integrated die cutting and pouching); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Analytical method development, validation and quality control with physical testing and analytical method capabilities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our facilities are FDA and DEA registered, and ISO9001 and ISO13485 certified. Our manufacturing facilities in Grand Rapids are licensed to manufacture over-the-counter, Or OTC, products, consumer products, prescription transdermal, dermal and mucosal products, as well as wound care products. Our Grand Rapids facilities also have the capacity to produce over 100 million patches annually and can be expanded as our needs grow. A number of our equipment lines have been fully funded by our partners to support the development of partnered products. In these cases, the partners retain title to those equipment lines, while we retain responsibility for maintaining and operating them. Our operations include on‑site quality control laboratories and testing procedures, quality assurance systems, and internal audit procedures for our processes and equipment.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends on our ability to obtain patents and protect our trade secrets and know‑how. We must be able to operate without infringing on any other company’s intellectual property and we must prevent others from 

 
  15

 
infringing our intellectual property. Our strategy is to protect our intellectual property by filing both U.S. and international patents related to our proprietary technologies, products, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. For both our Corplex and MicroCor platforms, we own all relevant material patents. With respect to our Corplex technology and products, and as of September 30, 2017, Corium owns or co-owns 29 U.S. issued patents and 111 foreign issued patents (which include granted European patents rights that have been validated in various EU member states) and 19 U.S. pending patents and 17 foreign pending patents.  The issued patents and patent applications, if issued, expire between 2021 and 2038 and include composition of matter, use and process claims to cover the proprietary technology platforms and specific products and product candidates.  Patents are issued or pending in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Russia, and the United States.  With respect to our MicroCor technology and products, and as of September 30, 2017, Corium owns 29 U.S. issued patents and 88 foreign issued patents (which include granted European patents rights that have been validated in various EU member states) and 17 U.S. pending patents and 84 foreign pending patents.  The issued patents and patent applications, if issued, expire between 2019 and 2038 and include composition of matter, use and process claims to cover the proprietary technology platforms and specific products and product candidates.  Patents are issued or pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and the United States.  For Corplex and MicroCor, some of the issued patents and pending patent applications, if issued, may also be eligible for patent term extension and patent term adjustment, respectively, thereby extending their patent terms.
 Proprietary rights for our products in development and our potential products will be protected from use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents owned by us (or licensed by us) may not protect us from competition in the future and our pending patent applications may not result in patent rights being issued. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as they do under U.S. law.
  Our products in development may be covered by third party patents or other intellectual property rights, in which case we would need to obtain a license to continue to develop and/or market these products. Such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms and such licenses may not be attainable, which could delay product launches if we are required to design around a patent. Litigation may be necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce patents, protect trade secrets or know‑how or to determine validity in order to freely sell a product in the marketplace. In addition, interference, derivation, post‑grant oppositions or other proceedings may be necessary to determine rights to inventions in our patents. Litigation could entail substantial financial costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 In certain circumstances, we rely on trade secrets to protect our technology. Trade secrets are difficult to protect. Generally, we protect our proprietary processes and manufacturing as trade secrets and we secure confidentiality agreements from all of our employees, contractors, consultants and advisors. We cannot assure that the agreements will not be breached, or that we will be able to remedy such a breach, or that our trade secrets will not become known in the public domain or be discovered by our competitors. Disputes may also arise with respect to know‑how and inventions created by our employees, contractors and consultants. See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Regulatory
 Food and Drug Administration. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical and consumer cosmetic products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. Many of our products are combination drug‑device products that are regulated as drugs by the FDA, with consultations from the device center in the FDA. Others, such as consumer teeth whitening products, are regulated by the FDA as cosmetics. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.

 FDA Regulation of Drugs. The process required by the FDA under the new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDC Act, before our investigational drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | Completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug for each proposed indication in accordance with the FDA’s current good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre‑approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the drug will be produced, to assess compliance with cGMP regulations, or, for our medical device components, the Quality System Regulation, or QSR; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the investigational drug, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy. For human clinical trials to be conducted in the United States, we must generally submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may begin human clinical trials. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30‑day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trials must review and approve any clinical study as well as the related informed consent forms and authorization forms that permit us to use individually identifiable health information of study participants.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objective of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trial results to public registries.
 The foregoing discussion of clinical trials applies to clinical trials conducted under an IND. In some instances, we may conduct clinical trials outside of the United States, which may require different or additional regulatory submissions depending on the country in which the trial is conducted.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases which may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase 1: Includes the initial introduction of an investigational drug into humans. Phase 1 studies are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects. Phase 1 studies are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. During these studies, sufficient information about the drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  17

 

be obtained to permit the design of well‑controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies. These studies may include studies of drug metabolism, structure‑activity relationships, and mechanism of action in humans, as well as studies in which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: Includes controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study, and to determine the common short‑term side effects and risks associated with the drug.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3: When Phase 2 clinical trials suggest effectiveness of a drug, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit‑risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials of our investigational drugs within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the IRB or the sponsor may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Sponsors of clinical trials may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. During the clinical development of products, sponsors may meet and consult with the FDA in an effort to ensure that the design of their studies will likely provide data both sufficient and relevant for later regulatory approval; however, no assurance of approvability can be given by the FDA. 
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the product. Submission of an NDA requires the payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, and although the agency has defined user fee goals that govern the length of an NDA’s review time, we cannot assure that the FDA will make a review decision in any particular timeframe. After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete but the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or one or more additional clinical trials and/or other requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing, any of which may be expensive and require considerable time to complete. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 After approving a drug, the FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. Requirements for additional Phase 4 studies (post‑approval marketing studies) to confirm safety and effectiveness in a broader commercial use population may be imposed as a condition of marketing approval. In addition, the FDA requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products that have been commercialized, and the agency has the power to require changes in labeling or to prevent further marketing of a product based on the results of these post‑marketing programs.
 Satisfaction of FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approval for any of our pharmaceutical systems under development on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Evolving safety concerns can result in the imposition of new requirements for expensive and time consuming tests. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any pharmaceutical systems that we may develop and obtain approval for would also be subject to adverse findings of the active drug ingredients being marketed in different dosage forms and 

 
  18

 
formulations. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business. Marketing our pharmaceutical systems abroad will require similar regulatory approvals and is subject to similar risks. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action. Currently, our partners are the NDA and ANDA holders of products that we develop with them, and therefore our partners communicate with FDA with respect to these applications.
 Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including cGMP requirements, and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP regulations, which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third‑party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.
 Past FDA and state inspections have identified and may in the future identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our suppliers of raw materials that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA‑initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. 
 The FDA regulates drug labeling and promotion activities. The FDA has actively enforced regulations prohibiting the marketing of products for unapproved uses, and federal and state authorities are also actively litigating against sponsors who promote their drugs for unapproved uses under various fraud and abuse and false claims act statutes. We and our pharmaceutical systems are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our pharmaceutical systems are or will be marketed. Any applicable state or local regulations may constrain our ability to market our pharmaceutical systems in those states or localities. We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
 The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our drug product candidates. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the United States and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
 The FDA also has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS to ensure the safe use of a drug. The FDA has authority to require a REMS under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 when necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the 

 
  19

 
drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. FDA is working towards improving the efficiency and reducing the burdens associated with REMS requirements and is actively considering ways to encourage the use of shared system REMS between all innovator and generic companies producing a particular drug, and to facilitate generic access to samples of drugs subject to REMS restrictions for the purpose of conducting bioequivalence testing.  Whether and how these policy goals will be implemented and how they will affect our products and those of our competitors remains uncertain.
 On July 9, 2012, the FDA approved a REMS for extended‑release and long‑acting opioid medications. Several of our currently marketed drug products and investigational drugs, including fentanyl, are subject to the REMS. The shared system REMS has been modified over time to add information about additional products, including various strengths of fentanyl transdermal systems.  The shared system REMS was most recently modified on May 26, 2017 to align the materials with enhanced class-wide safety labeling changes required for opioid analgesics.  The labeling changes include modifications to the medications’ indications, limitations of use, and warnings (including prominent boxed warnings that highlight the risks of abuse associated with these drugs), as well as safety information about potentially harmful drug interactions and about the effects of opioids on the endocrine system. There may be increased cost, administrative burden and potential liability associated with the marketing and sale of drugs subject to the REMS requirement, which could negatively impact the commercial benefits to us and our partners from the sale of these drug products and, if approved, drug product candidates. Our partners, as the holders of the marketing applications for the affected drugs, are responsible for compliance with the opioid REMS requirements.
 The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) added new sections in the FFDC Act that require manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, dispensers, and third-party logistics providers to take steps to identify and trace certain prescription drugs to protect against the threats of counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful drugs in the supply chain.  Among other mandates, the DSCSA requires manufacturers and repackagers to affix or imprint a unique product identifier (comprised of a standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product) on certain prescription drug packages in both a human-readable and on a machine-readable data carrier.  The standardized numerical identifier is comprised of the product’s corresponding National Drug Code combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number.  A drug product is misbranded if it does not bear the product identifier as required by Section 582 of the FFDC Act.  Section 582 also establishes several requirements relating to the verification of product identifiers. Implementation of the product identifier requirements has imposed and will continue to impose increased costs and administrative burdens and may lead to potential liability associated with the marketing and sale of drug products subject to these requirements.
 Hatch‑Waxman Act. Section 505 of the FFDC Act describes three types of NDAs that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch‑Waxman Act, created two additional marketing pathways under Sections 505(b)(2) and 505(j) of the FFDC Act. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, called the Reference Listed Drug, or RLD, or on published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and effectiveness. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to (i.e., performs in the same manner as) the innovator drug. The generic version generally must deliver approximately the same amount of active ingredients into a patient’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug.
 Although there is no clear published FDA guidance on whether bioequivalence studies can be relied on for approval of a transdermal formulation under the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway where the RLD is an oral dosage form, we have received written feedback from the FDA on our pre-IND submissions for both Corplex Donepezil and Corplex Memantine confirming that a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway based solely on a demonstration of bioequivalence 

 
  20

 
is acceptable for each of these product candidates.  Based on this guidance, and confirmed by FDA in our recent end of Phase 2 meeting regarding Corplex Donepezil, we have made a direct transition from the pilot bioequivalence study to a single pivotal bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers, saving expense and time.
 Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30‑month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30 month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation.
 The Hatch‑Waxman Act establishes periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products, during which the FDA cannot approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the branded reference drug. For example, the holder of an NDA may obtain five years of exclusivity upon approval of a new drug containing a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved by the FDA. The Hatch‑Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three‑year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDA for drugs that include the innovation that required the new clinical data.
 We expect that most of our drug candidates will utilize the section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Even though several of our drug products utilize active drug ingredients that are commercially marketed in the United States in other dosage forms, we need to establish safety and effectiveness of those active ingredients in the formulation and dosage forms that we are developing. We also have several partnered products that are approved pursuant to ANDAs or will be filed under the ANDA pathway. All approved products, both innovator and generic, are listed in FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book).
 We have begun consultations with a small number of non-U.S. regulatory bodies to determine whether regulatory approval based upon bioequivalence would be possible. We have received formal feedback from one major European country that the bioequivalence regulatory pathway is likely to be available for Corplex Donepezil in that country and we are awaiting additional feedback on the potential regulatory pathway from another major European country. We have submitted the data from our pilot BE study with the regulatory authorities in that European country for review. In addition, we have had preliminary conversations with Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, Japan, who have indicated that regulatory approval based on bioequivalence in Japan is unlikely. If non-U.S. regulatory bodies determine that an abbreviated pathway based on the demonstration of bioequivalence is not available for Corplex Donepezil, we will need to perform more expensive, time-consuming preclinical tests and/or clinical trials, likely including clinical efficacy and safety studies to seek regulatory approval in the relevant non-U.S. jurisdictions and, if we are unable to perform these studies or obtain regulatory approval, we will not be able to commercialize our Alzheimer’s product candidates in these jurisdictions.
 The Drug Enforcement Administration. Certain of our products, including our fentanyl patch, are regulated as a “controlled substance” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or the CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration, or the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control and handling of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.

 
  21

 

 The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. Certain active ingredients are listed by the DEA as Schedule II and Schedule III under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, research, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of oversight and regulation. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, generally physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. Furthermore, the amount of Schedule II substances we can obtain for clinical trials and commercial distribution is limited by the DEA in accordance with a quota system and our quota may not be sufficient to complete clinical trials or meet commercial demand. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much fentanyl may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount of fentanyl that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule II substance, including fentanyl for use in manufacturing our fentanyl products. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments.
 Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
 The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
 Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings. Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our partners will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products.
 There is a risk that DEA regulations may interfere with the supply of the drugs used in our clinical trials and sold commercially, and, thus on our ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to meet clinical and commercial demand.
 FDA Regulation of Consumer Cosmetic Products. Consumer teeth whitening products are regulated by the FDA as cosmetics. The processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of these products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA and the FTC, and by various agencies of the states and localities in which these products are sold. Cosmetic products and their ingredients do not require premarket approval prior to sale, but are subject to specific labeling regulations. While the FDA has not promulgated specific cGMPs for the manufacture of cosmetics, the FDA has provided guidelines for cosmetic manufacturers to follow to ensure that their products are neither misbranded or adulterated.
 The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of cosmetics. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. We are also subject to regulation under various state, 

 
  22

 
local, and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of cosmetics.
 Other Healthcare Laws. Although we do not directly market or promote any of our products, we and our partners are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws may include, without limitation: (a) federal and state laws relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and any other federal healthcare program; (b) federal and state laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, including, without limitation, the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a‑7b(b)), the federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 et seq.), the False Statements Statute, (42 U.S.C. § 1320a‑7b(a)), the Exclusion Laws (42 U.S.C. § 1320a‑7), the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act (42 U.S.C. § 1320a‑7h), the Anti‑Inducement Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a‑7a(a)(5)), the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (42 U.S.C. § 1320a‑7a) and criminal laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, including but not limited to 18 U.S.C. §§ 286, 287 and 1001, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, (Pub.L. 104‑191); (c) state laws relating to Medicaid or any other state healthcare or health insurance programs; (d) federal or state laws relating to billing or claims for reimbursement submitted to any third party payor, employer or similar entity, or patient; (e) any other federal or state laws relating to fraudulent, abusive or unlawful practices connected in any way with the provision or marketing of healthcare items or services, including laws relating to the billing or submitting of claims for reimbursement for any items or services reimbursable under any state, federal or other governmental healthcare or health insurance program or any private payor; and (f) federal and state laws relating to health information privacy and security, including HIPAA, and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and any regulations promulgated thereunder. If our operations or our partners’ operations and practices are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us or our partners, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 Coverage and Reimbursement. Sales of our products marketed by our partners will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third‑party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third‑party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for certain medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. In the United States, there has been an increase in political support for controlling significant price increases of drug products, in particular due to high-profile cases that have gained national attention and triggered Congressional inquiries. In many European markets for pharmaceuticals, drug price controls at various levels are prevalent. In many U.S. and most major European markets there is also increased pressure on pricing and reimbursement practices relating to products that are new dosage forms of drugs that are currently available at lower cost in their original forms. For our transdermal products that incorporate active drug ingredients that are no longer patent protected, we expect that we will need to substantiate the differential benefits of our products in order to receive reimbursement at desired levels. Even if one of our transdermal products would incorporate active drug ingredients that are still patent protected, many EU Member States might still require evidence of differential benefits compared to products with different active drug ingredients. Decreases in third‑party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third‑party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures.
 Marketing and Sales
 Due to the nature of our partnerships and our current business relationships, we currently do not have or require an in‑house commercial sales force or marketing function. We have a business development program that generates new 

 
  23

 
business opportunities with pharmaceutical and biopharma companies, including delivering their proprietary drugs in transdermal systems to improve their therapeutic profile, extending the brand life of drugs by offering new dosage forms, and co‑developing products that we have initiated. Historically, we have partnered with pharmaceutical companies to market and sell each of the products that we develop and manufacture. In most cases, we work together with our partners to decide which products to develop. However, in some instances we develop products on our own prior to partnering with another company. In the future, we may build our own commercial sales and marketing capability in certain markets in order to capture more of the economic value of the products that we may develop. We may also enter into co‑promotion agreements for certain of our products with our partners. We will continue to pursue strategic alliances with partners who have significant marketing and distribution presence and expertise.
 Competition
 Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition from other companies in numerous industries, including pharmaceuticals and drug delivery. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of our products and the development of our product candidates include onset of action, bioavailability, efficacy, patent protection, compliance, cost, convenience of dosing, safety and tolerability profile.
 Companies focused on delivering small molecules transdermally include 3M, Johnson & Johnson, Lohmann Therapie-Systeme, Mylan, Hisamitsu (through its subsidiary, Noven), Allergan, and Actavis/Teva. Companies operating in the microneedle transdermal field include 3M, Zosano, Theraject, Lohmann Therapie-Systeme and Fujifilm. Several academic institutions are also conducting research in the microneedle field. In addition to microneedle technologies, there are other methods of transdermal delivery under development for biologics, including heat ablation, laser, ultrasound and radio frequency. Companies developing and manufacturing transdermal systems for biologics include Becton Dickinson, Vyteris, and Zogenix. Some of these companies may be addressing the same therapeutic areas or indications as we are.
 Our current products compete, and products in development will compete, in highly competitive markets against both transdermal products and products addressing similar patient and customer needs through other delivery forms. Clonidine TDS, Fentanyl TDS and our future ANDA products will have competition from other generic pharmaceutical companies, including Mylan and Actavis/Teva, both of which have their own transdermal manufacturing capability. Other manufacturers of fentanyl patches use a different technology than ours, and although fentanyl patches made with either technology have experienced manufacturing challenges, competitors may claim their technology is superior. The Crest Whitestrips products compete with teeth whitening products marketed by various private labels such as those at Walgreens and CVS.
 Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, and human resources than we do, may succeed in obtaining patent protection before us, and have greater experience than we do commercializing products and developing product candidates, including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals for product candidates. Consequently, our competitors are applying significant resources and experience to the problems of drug delivery and transdermal drug delivery in particular. We cannot assure you that our transdermal delivery systems will compete effectively against existing and future transdermal or other delivery systems.
 Employees
 As of September 30, 2017 we had 213 employees, including 29 in research and development, 163 in operations and 21 in general and administrative roles. From time to time, we also employ independent contractors to support our research and development and our administrative organizations. We also hire temporary employees when needed in our manufacturing and in other groups. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
