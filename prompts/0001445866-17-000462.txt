Item 1.
Business.
Living 3D is a globally integrated enterprise that targets the intersection of 3D technology and effective business. The Company specialized in the design, development, production, sale and marketing of “auto stereoscopic 3D" technology, or Auto 3D products. The products we marketed were based on Auto 3D, which means that viewers are not required to wear 3D glasses in order to experience the 3D effects of the screen, and instant switching between two dimensional, or 2D, and 3D viewing is enabled. We believe that this gave us a competitive advantage over other suppliers of 3D products requiring the use of a visor or glasses in order to experience a 3D effect.
 The Company also provided technical and support services of 3D in software development, contents production and hardware configuration to a wide range of industries, including entertainment, education, consumer electronics, medical diagnosis, scientific research and, in particular, media and advertising. The Company aimed at customizing product requirements and specifications in order to enhance the power of product displays in business advertising and special operational environments.
  Through innovative and reliable provision of products and services as well as collaboration with other strategic partners, the Company embarked on the following new strategic directions: 
 

Enabling enterprises to fully exploit the power and capacity of 3D technology; 
 

Satisfying the full range of media display in business advertising and business operation; 
 

Enabling a truly integrated solution for 3D applications and powerful display specially customized for business requirements and operations; and 
 

Developing and delivering a comprehensive low cost media content development and productivity environment. 
 We marketed our 3D technologies and products under our Living 3D brand in the PRC.
 With the change in the Company’s control in December 2015, the Company redefined its business from 3D technology development to computer software development with major operations in Hong Kong and Mainland China. The Company now focuses on the research and development of ecommerce platform, mobile game and virtual reality application. Our ecommerce platform seeks to integrate web application with product manufacturing which will increase the productivity and efficiency of the operation. Along with the ever increasing usage of the internet, our O2O (O2O stands for “online to offline,” a term used to describe a variety of ecommerce services that provide online information, services, or discounts to consumers that enhance their offline shopping experiences.) ecommerce platform is expected to bring in more business opportunities to the manufacturer. 
 Corporate History
 The Company was incorporated on October 28, 1987 in the state of Nevada under the name Staco Incorporated. It was organized for the purpose of conducting business as a transfer agent. This business was unsuccessful as a transfer agent and the Company became inactive. The business remained inactive until November 30, 2001, when it acquired certain assets from Cordell Henrie, a sole proprietor doing business as "Concrete Casting" and he became its president. Staco Incorporated changed its name to Concrete Casting Incorporated on January 17, 2002. The assets acquired included drawings, plans and concepts regarding the design of replicas of antiquities to be cast in concrete and marketed to the U.S. landscaping market. From such point through December 31, 2007, Concrete Casting focused on concrete products though its emphasis changed from replicas of antiquities to construction applications, such as casted window wells and water features for landscaping use. Mr. Henrie eventually was no longer able to devote the time necessary to Concrete Casting’s product development and he resigned as an officer and a director as of December 31, 2007. Because Concrete Casting's development in the concrete casting business was not sufficiently mature to make it commercially viable, the decision was made to shut down development of concrete products and discontinue those operations.

In 2008, Concrete Casting hired Kevin J. Asher as its new president to locate and acquire new business opportunities. At such time, Concrete Casting was a shell company with nominal assets whose sole business was to identify, evaluate and investigate various companies with the intent to effect a reverse merger transaction in which it would acquire a target company with an operating business to continue the acquired company’s business as a publicly-held entity. On July 1, 2010, Concrete Casting changed its name to "AirWare International Corp." and on September 27, 2011, AirWare International changed its name to "Living 3D Holdings, Inc."
 On December 8, 2011, certain of the prior shareholders of Living 3D Holdings, Inc. , a Nevada corporation and a publicly held and traded company (the "Company”), who were the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (the "Selling Shareholders") and Jimmy Kent-Lam Wong, June Mon Yon, Chang Li, Kin Wah Ngai and Lin Su (each, a "Purchaser" and collectively, the "Purchasers"), entered into a stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"). Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers purchased from the Selling Shareholders an aggregate of 3,627,426 of the shares (the "Purchase Shares") of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company owned by the Selling Shareholders on December 8, 2011 (the “Closing Date”), for an aggregate consideration of $385,000 (the "Stock Purchase"). 
 Also on the Closing Date, the Company, Living 3D Holdings, Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation and a privately held company (“L3D-BVI”), and all of the shareholders of L3D-BVI (the “L3D-BVI Shareholders”) entered into a share acquisition and exchange agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement"). Under the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired from the L3D-BVI Shareholders all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of L3D-BVI (the "L3D-BVI Shares"), making L3D-BVI a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and, in exchange for all of the L3D-BVI Shares (the “Share Exchange”), the Company issued to the L3D-BVI Shareholders an aggregate of 62,590,880 shares (the “Exchange Shares”) of its common stock. L3D-BVI was incorporated on June 23, 2008 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands and was, at the time of the Stock Purchase and Share Exchange, a privately held company, while the Company was a publicly held and traded company on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol "CCSG." 
 Upon the completion of the Stock Purchase and the Share Exchange, our business became that of L3D-BVI, our wholly-owned subsidiary. As prior to the Stock Purchase and the Share Exchange, the Company had no operating activities, the financial statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis reflect the activity of L3D-BVI for all periods presented. Upon the closing of the Stock Purchase and the Share Exchange, the shareholders of the Company retained an aggregate of 3,485,174 shares of common stock and the former L3D-BVI Shareholders acquired an aggregate of 66,218,306 shares of common stock, for a total of 69,703,480 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Accordingly, the former L3D-BVI Shareholders owned approximately 95% of the Company's total issued and outstanding common stock. The foregoing descriptions of the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Share Exchange Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the provisions of such documents included as exhibits in our filings with the SEC. 
 On November 30, 2015, Jimmy Kent-Lam Wong, who was the holder of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company (“Wong”), and Man Wah Stephen Yip (“Yip”) entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Wong-Yip Stock Purchase Agreement”). Under the terms of the Wong-Yip Stock Purchase Agreement, Yip purchased from Wong an aggregate of 37,883,841 of the shares (the “Wong-Yip Purchase Shares”) of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company owned by Wong, for a nominal consideration of $100.
 By a separate Stock Purchase Agreement dated November 30, 2015, the Company had disposed of all of its subsidiary companies, namely, Living 3D Holdings, Limited, Living 3D International (HK) Limited, Colombia College Hollywood International Limited and Living 3D Technology Group Limited to Jimmy Kent-Lam Wong at a nominal consideration of $100. The disposal was effective as of October 1, 2015.

Recent Development
 
On December 30, 2016, the Company entered into a share acquisition and exchange agreement (the "Share Acquisition and Exchange") with Sugar Technology Group Holdings Corporation (“Sugar”), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (the “BVI”). Under the Share Acquisition and Exchange, the Company issued an aggregate of 30,000,000 shares of its common stock at par value of $0.001 each to all of the shareholders of Sugar in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding stock of Sugar. The Share Acquisition and Exchange was closed on January 5, 2017. As a result of the Share Acquisition and Exchange, Sugar became the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary. 
 

Sugar engages in computer software development with major operations in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Sugar focuses on the research and development of e-commerce platform, mobile game and virtual reality application. The e-commerce platform seeks to integrate web application with product manufacturing which will increase the productivity and efficiency of the operation. Along with the ever increasing usage of the internet, our O2O e-commerce platform is expected to bring in more business opportunities to the manufacturer. 
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers 
 We have relied on third parties in the past to manufacture products for us to market and sell. Although we may use our current manufacturers for future product orders we obtain, we do not have any obligation to use such manufacturers nor do we currently have any future product orders pending. Given our current level of operations, we have not had problems obtaining sufficient supplies of raw materials or component parts. We do not have multiple sources of supply for these items, but believe there are readily available alternative sources at acceptable prices.
Inventory, Operating Capital and Seasonality
  We have no inventory because historically we have our products manufactured only after we receive orders for them. In the future, we may seek to store products pending sale at the manufacturing facilities that produced such products, if feasible. We do not maintain any warehouse facility. Our computer software development business is too new to be able to assess whether seasonality could be a material factor in our business. We do not currently require material amounts of operating capital because we are in the development stage.
Dependence on Major Customers
 We do not yet have any major customers of our computer software development business. 
 Competition
 Nearly all established computer software development companies have significantly greater human and economic resources than we currently do and there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete with them for market share.
Intellectual Property, Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets
 We rely on certain intellectual property rights which consist principally of trade secrets and know-how. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to obtain future licenses on terms acceptable to us, or on any terms, or to successfully develop or contract for the development of new computer software to enable us to manufacture new products for sale in the future. We have not registered any trademarks or copyrights and there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect any trademarks and copyrights from infringement or third party claims, if any. We have not filed for any patents on our technologies. Lastly, no assurance can be given that third parties will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.
