Organization History


As of December 31, 2016, HSBC Finance Corporation and its subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ("HSBC North America"), which is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc ("HSBC" and, together with its subsidiaries, "HSBC Group"). Prior to November 15, 2016, HSBC Finance Corporation was owned by HSBC Investments (North America) Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which was dissolved. HSBC Finance Corporation, which traces its origin to 1878, operated as a consumer finance company under the name Household Finance Corporation for most of its history. Its principal business is to act as a holding company for its subsidiaries. In this Form 10-K, HSBC Finance Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to as "we", "us" or "our". 

HSBC North America Operations

HSBC North America is the holding company for HSBC's operations in the United States. The principal subsidiaries of HSBC North America at December 31, 2016 were HSBC Finance Corporation, HSBC USA Inc. ("HSBC USA"), a U.S. bank holding company, HSBC Markets (USA) Inc. ("HMUS"), a holding company for certain subsidiaries, primarily associated with the global banking and markets businesses, and HSBC Technology & Services (USA) Inc. ("HTSU"), a provider of information technology and centralized operational and support services including human resources, tax, finance, compliance, legal, corporate affairs and other services shared among the subsidiaries of HSBC North America and the HSBC Group. HSBC USA's principal U.S. banking subsidiary is HSBC Bank USA, National Association (together with its subsidiaries, "HSBC Bank USA"). Under the oversight of HSBC North America, HSBC Finance Corporation works with its affiliates to maximize opportunities and efficiencies in HSBC's operations in the United States. These affiliates do so by providing each other with, among other things, alternative sources of liquidity to fund operations and expertise in specialized corporate functions and services. This has historically been demonstrated by a pooling of resources within HTSU to provide shared, allocated support functions to all HSBC North America subsidiaries. In addition, clients of HSBC Bank USA and other affiliates are investors in HSBC Finance Corporation's debt and/or preferred stock. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. ("HSI"), a registered broker dealer and a subsidiary of HMUS, historically led or participated as underwriter of domestic issuances of HSBC Finance Corporation's term debt and asset-backed securities. While HSBC Finance Corporation did not receive advantaged pricing, underwriting fees and commissions paid to HSI historically have benefited the HSBC Group.

HSBC Finance Corporation Operations

HSBC Finance Corporation's subsidiaries historically provided lending products to consumers in the United States. HSBC Finance Corporation has historically been the principal fund raising vehicle for the operations of its subsidiaries. Our lending products included real estate secured, personal non-credit card and auto finance receivables, as well as credit card and private label credit card and tax refund anticipation loans and related products, all of which we no longer originate. All of these product lines have been sold other than real-estate secured receivables, which are now entirely classified as held for sale and are in the process of being sold. We report our segments on a continuing operations basis and have one segment: Consumer, which consists of the run-off real estate secured receivable portfolio.
As discussed more fully in Note 3, "Discontinued Operations," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, our former Card and Retail Services and Commercial businesses are reported as discontinued operations. 
Prior to the fourth quarter of 2016, we managed our business in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis") which applied International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the European Union ("EU") and we reported segment results under the Group Reporting Basis. As a result of classifying all remaining receivables as held for sale in the third quarter of 2016, our primary focus has shifted to the successful completion of our receivable sales program. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised the scope and content of our internal management reporting to focus on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") based financial results, which more closely reflects the financial performance management is most focused on as receivable sales progress. This U.S. GAAP financial information is used to monitor and review operating results, evaluate trends and make decisions about allocating resources such as employees. As a result of the shift in focus to U.S. GAAP based management reporting, there are no longer any reporting differences between our consolidated results and our segment results. As we only have one segment,

HSBC Finance Corporation

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in future periods, we no longer report segment results separately for any periods presented.
Our Consumer segment consists of our run-off Consumer Lending and Mortgage Services businesses. The Consumer segment provided real estate secured and personal non-credit card receivables with both revolving and closed-end terms and with fixed or variable interest rates. While these businesses have been operating in run-off since 2009 and 2007, respectively, they do not qualify to be reported as discontinued operations.
As described more fully in Note 7, "Receivables Held for Sale," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we have been engaged in an on-going evaluation of our balance sheet taking into consideration our liquidity, capital and funding requirements as well as capital requirements of HSBC. During the second quarter of 2013, we established an on-going receivable sales program under which we intended to sell first lien real estate secured receivables held for investment meeting pre-determined criteria when they were written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies (generally 180 days past due). During the second quarter of 2015, we expanded our receivable sales program to also include substantially all of our first lien real estate secured receivables held for investment which had been either re-aged, modified or became subject to a bankruptcy filing since 2007, along with any second lien balances associated with these receivables. In September 2016, we further expanded our receivable sales program to include all remaining real estate secured receivables classified as held for investment as we no longer have the intent to hold these receivables. We expect that substantially all of the receivables held for sale at December 31, 2016 will be sold in multiple transactions through 2017, although the actual time to complete these sales and ultimate earnings impact depend on many factors, including future market conditions. During 2016, we completed sales of receivables with an unpaid principal balance of $10,130 million at the time of sale to third-party investors.
See Note 7, "Receivables Held for Sale," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on receivables held for sale as well as receivables sold during 2016.

Funding

Our primary sources of funding in 2016 were proceeds from sales of real estate secured receivables, liquidation of short-term investments, cash generated from operations, including receivable payments and pay-offs, and real estate owned ("REO") sales proceeds. We use the cash generated by these funding sources to fund our operations, service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our preferred stockholder. However, as we continue to execute our receivable sales program, cash flows subsequent to 2017 may not provide sufficient cash to meet our funding needs. Any required incremental funding has been integrated into the overall HSBC North America funding plans which we expect to be sourced through HSBC USA, HSBC North America, or through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates. 
HSBC North America continues to review the composition of its capital structure following the adoption by the U.S. banking regulators of the final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital and liquidity reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which were effective as of January 1, 2014. Upon receipt of regulatory approval, HSBC North America replaced instruments whose treatment was less favorable under the new rules with Basel III compliant instruments. To that end, in 2016 we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of the 6.36 percent Non-Cumulative Series B preferred stock for $575 million.
A detailed description of our sources of funding of our operations is set forth in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A"). 

Employees and Customers

At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1,200 employees. 
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 114,700 accounts related to customers with outstanding receivable balances. We have significant concentrations of receivables held for sale for customers in New York ($508 million), California ($493 million), Florida ($333 million), Pennsylvania ($331 million) and Ohio ($303 million). 

Regulation and Competition

Regulation
Consumer Regulation  We operate in a highly regulated environment. In addition to the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB") and the other consumer related provisions of the "Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act" (the "Dodd-Frank Act" or "Dodd-Frank") described below, our business is subject to numerous state and other 
5


HSBC Finance Corporation

federal laws relating to consumer protection including, without limitation, fair lending, fair debt collection practices, mortgage loan servicing obligations, bankruptcy, military service member protections, use of credit reports, privacy matters, bankruptcy, disclosure of credit terms and correction of billing errors. 
Local, state and national regulatory and enforcement agencies continue efforts to address perceived problems within the mortgage servicing industry through broad or targeted legislative or regulatory initiatives aimed at servicers' operations in consumer lending markets. There continues to be a significant amount of legislative and regulatory activity, nationally, locally and at the state level, designed to limit certain lending practices while mandating certain servicing procedures. We are also subject to certain regulations and legislation that limit operations in certain jurisdictions. For example, limitations may be placed on the amount of interest or fees that may be charged on a loan, the types of actions that may be taken to collect or foreclose upon delinquent receivables or the information about a customer that may be shared. For consumer receivables still being serviced by HSBC Finance Corporation, certain consumer finance subsidiaries and affiliated entities assisting with this servicing are generally licensed by state regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Such licenses have limited terms but are renewable, and are revocable for cause. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may limit the ability of our licensed entities to collect or enforce loan agreements made with consumers and may cause these subsidiaries to be liable for damages and penalties. Further, federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws, as well as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, affect the ability of servicers, including HSBC Finance Corporation, to collect outstanding balances. 
Due to the turmoil in the mortgage lending markets in prior years, there has also been a significant amount of federal and state legislative and regulatory focus on this industry. There is increased regulatory oversight over residential mortgage servicers, including through state and federal examinations and periodic inquiries from state Attorneys General for information. Several regulators, legislators and other governmental bodies have promoted particular views of appropriate or "model" receivable modification programs, as well as foreclosure and loss mitigation practices. We have a repayment plan and a loan modification program for customers facing financial hardship who express the desire to remain in their homes. We also evaluate the results of our customer assistance efforts and we continue to enhance and refine our programs based on performance and industry trends. In certain situations, we offer qualified customers relocation assistance to help avoid foreclosure. 
In 2011, HSBC Finance Corporation and our then indirect parent, HSBC North America, entered into a consent cease and desist order with the Federal Reserve Board (the "FRB") (the "Federal Reserve Servicing Consent Order"), and our affiliate, HSBC Bank USA, entered into a similar consent order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") (the "OCC Servicing Consent Order" and together with the Federal Reserve Servicing Consent Order, the "Servicing Consent Orders") following completion of a broad horizontal review of industry foreclosure practices. The Servicing Consent Orders required us to take prescribed actions to address the foreclosure practice deficiencies described in the consent order. The Servicing Consent Orders also required an independent review of foreclosures ("the Independent Foreclosure Review") pending or completed between January 2009 and December 2010 to determine if any borrower was financially injured as a result of an error in the foreclosure process. In 2013, HSBC Finance Corporation and our then indirect parent, HSBC North America, entered into an agreement with the FRB, and our affiliate, HSBC Bank USA, entered into an agreement with the OCC, pursuant to which the Independent Foreclosure Review ceased and HSBC North America made a cash payment of $96 million into a fund used to make payments to borrowers that were in active foreclosure during 2009 and 2010 and we agreed to provide other assistance (e.g. receivable modifications) to help eligible borrowers. As a result, in 2012, we recorded expenses of $85 million reflecting the portion of HSBC North America's total expense we believe is allocable to us. As of December 31, 2016, Rust Consulting, Inc., the paying agent, has issued virtually all checks to eligible borrowers. On January 6, 2017, the OCC terminated the OCC Servicing Consent Order with HSBC Bank USA. See Note 20, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Banking Institutions  HSBC North America is required to meet consolidated regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, including new or modified regulatory guidance, in accordance with current regulatory timelines. We will continue to support HSBC North America's compliance with U.S. regulatory requirements, therefore the results of broader regulatory change could impact the availability of funding for us. 
In 2013, the U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States (the "Basel III Final Rule"). The Basel III Final Rule phases in a complete replacement to the Basel I general risk-based capital rules, builds on the Advanced Approaches of Basel II, incorporates certain changes to the market risk capital rules, and implements certain other requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. HSBC North America became subject to the Basel III Final Rule as of January 1, 2014. Several of the provisions of the Basel III Final Rule will be phased in through 2019. We anticipate HSBC North America will meet these requirements well in advance of the ultimate full phase-in date. However, it is possible that further increases in regulatory capital may be required in response to the implementation of the Basel III Final Rule. The exact amount, however, will depend upon our prevailing risk profile and that of our North American affiliates under various stress scenarios. 
In 2009, the Basel Committee proposed two minimum standards for limiting liquidity risk: the liquidity coverage ratio ("LCR"), designed to be a short-term measure to ensure banks have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days, and the net stable funding ratio ("NSFR"), which is a longer term measure with a 12-month time horizon 
6


HSBC Finance Corporation

to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities. Under European Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/61, the consolidated LCR became a minimum regulatory standard from October 1, 2015. The European calibration of the Basel Committee based NSFR is still pending. The Basel Committee finalized the LCR in 2013 with phase-in beginning in 2015. The Basel Committee finalized the NSFR in 2014. 
In 2014, the FRB, the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") issued final regulations to implement the LCR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking institutions, including HSBC North America. The LCR final rule is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but is more stringent in several areas including the range of assets that will qualify as high-quality liquid assets and the assumed rate of outflows of certain kinds of funding. Under the final rule, U.S. institutions began the LCR transition period on January 1, 2015 and were required to be fully compliant by January 1, 2017, two years ahead of the Basel Committee's timeframe for compliance by January 1, 2019. The current requirement to report LCR to U.S. regulators on a monthly basis moved to a daily requirement beginning on July 1, 2016. The LCR final rule does not address the NSFR requirement, which is currently in an international observation period. Based on the results of the observation period, the Basel Committee and U.S. banking regulators may make further changes to the NSFR. In April 2016, U.S. regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America. The NSFR proposal is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but similar to the U.S. LCR final rule, is more stringent in several areas including the required stable funding factors applied to certain assets such as mortgage-backed securities. Under the proposal, U.S. institutions would be required to comply with the NSFR rule by January 1, 2018, consistent with the scheduled global implementation of the Basel Committee based NSFR.
In 2014, the FRB also issued rules pursuant to Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which established enhanced prudential standards for U.S. bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations with total global consolidated assets of $50 billion or more ("Covered Companies"). The rules require Covered Companies, such as HSBC North America, to comply with various liquidity risk management standards and to maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing. Covered Companies are also required to meet heightened liquidity requirements, which include qualitative liquidity standards, cash flow projections, internal liquidity stress tests, and liquidity buffer requirements. HSBC North America has implemented the standard and it does not have a significant impact to our business model. As of July 1, 2016, HSBC North America is treated as a single intermediate holding company, commonly referred to as an IHC, owned by a non-U.S. banking organization. The transition to being treated as a single intermediate holding company did not have a significant impact on our U.S. operations or change our liquidity management policies. HSBC North America has adjusted its liquidity profile to support compliance with these rules, however, we do not anticipate such adjustments to significantly impact our operations. HSBC North America may need to make further changes to its liquidity profile to support compliance with any future final rules.
HSBC Finance Corporation will continue to support HSBC North America's compliance with U.S. regulatory capital requirements, including participation in HSBC North America's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") stress testing and capital plan submission to the FRB and its implementation of the Basel III Final Rule. HSBC North America and HSBC Finance Corporation also continue to support HSBC's implementation of the Basel III capital and liquidity frameworks, as adopted by the UK Prudential Regulation Authority. We supply data regarding credit risk, operational risk and market risk to support HSBC's regulatory capital and risk weighted asset calculations.
As a result of our acquisition by HSBC, HSBC Finance Corporation and its subsidiaries became subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the FRB. HSBC is a bank holding company under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA") as a result of its ownership of HSBC Bank USA. On January 1, 2004, HSBC created a North American organization structure to hold all of its North America operations, including HSBC Finance Corporation and its subsidiaries. HSBC North America is also a bank holding company under the BHCA, by virtue of its ownership of HSBC Bank USA. HSBC and HSBC North America qualified as financial holding companies pursuant to the amendments to the BHCA effected by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the "GLB Act"). Under regulations implemented by the FRB, if any financial holding company, or any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company, ceases to meet certain capital or management standards, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies. In addition, the FRB may require divestiture of the holding company's depository institutions or its affiliates engaged in broader financial activities in reliance on the GLB Act if the deficiencies persist. The regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended, the FRB must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. As reflected in the agreement entered into with the OCC on December 11, 2012 (the "GLBA Agreement"), the OCC has determined that HSBC Bank USA is not in compliance with the requirements for a national bank and each depository institution affiliate of the national bank to be both well capitalized and well managed in order to own or control a "financial subsidiary", a subsidiary of a bank that also may engage in broader activities than subsidiaries of non-qualified banks. As a result, HSBC North America and its parent holding companies no longer meet the qualification requirements for financial holding company status, and may not directly or indirectly acquire control of, or 
7


HSBC Finance Corporation

hold an interest in, any new financial subsidiary, nor commence a new activity in its existing financial subsidiary, unless it receives prior approval from the OCC. If all of our affiliate depositary institutions are not in compliance with these requirements within the time periods specified in the GLBA Agreement, as they may be extended, HSBC North America could be required either to divest HSBC Bank USA or to divest or terminate any financial activities conducted in reliance on financial holding company status under the GLB Act. Similar consequences could result for financial subsidiaries of HSBC Bank USA that engage in activities in reliance on expanded powers provided for in the GLB Act. The GLBA Agreement requires HSBC Bank USA to take all steps necessary to correct the circumstances and conditions resulting in HSBC Bank USA's noncompliance with the requirements referred to above. HSBC Bank USA continues to take steps to satisfy the requirements of the GLBA Agreement. 
HSBC North America is supervised and examined by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. We are also regularly examined and reviewed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
Financial Regulatory Reform  In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. This legislation is a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. financial regulatory system. The law is comprehensive and includes many provisions specifically relevant to our businesses and the businesses of our affiliates. Following the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, the new Administration in the U.S. (the "Administration") has indicated it would like to see changes made to certain financial reform regulations, including Dodd-Frank. The specifics of what might be changed are currently unclear, which has introduced uncertainty about the regulatory framework that will apply to the financial services industry going forward and what impact any changes would have on our operations.
Oversight.  In order to promote financial stability in the U.S. financial system, the Dodd-Frank Act created a framework for the enhanced prudential regulation and supervision of financial institutions that are deemed to be "systemically important" to the U.S. financial system, including U.S. bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as HSBC North America. This framework is subject to the general oversight of the Financial Stability Oversight Council ("FSOC"), an interagency coordinating body. The FRB has authority, in consultation with the FSOC, to take certain actions, including to preclude mergers, restrict financial products offered, restrict, terminate or impose conditions on activities or require the sale or transfer of assets against any systemically important bank holding company that is found to pose a grave threat to financial stability. The FSOC is supported by the Office of Financial Research ("OFR") which will impose data reporting requirements on financial institutions. The cost of operating both the FSOC and OFR is paid for through an assessment on large bank holding companies, which began in July 2012.
Increased Prudential Standards.  In addition to the increased capital, liquidity and other enhanced prudential and structural requirements described above, large international banks, such as HSBC (generally with regard to its U.S. operations), are required to file resolution plans describing what strategy would be followed to resolve the institution in the event of significant financial distress. If the FRB and the FDIC both determine that these resolution plans are not "credible" (which, although not defined, is generally believed to mean the regulators do not believe the plans are feasible or would otherwise allow the regulators to resolve the U.S. businesses in a way that protects systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption and without exposing taxpayers to loss), our failure to cure deficiencies in a resolution plan required by Dodd-Frank to be filed by HSBC would enable the FRB and the FDIC, acting jointly, to impose more stringent prudential limits or require the divestiture of assets or operations. There are also provisions in Dodd-Frank that relate to governance of executive compensation, including disclosures evidencing the relationship between compensation and performance and a requirement that some executive incentive compensation is forfeitable in the event of an accounting restatement.
Affiliate Transaction Limits.  Quantitative and qualitative limits on bank credit transactions with affiliates also include credit exposure related to repurchase agreements, derivatives and securities lending/borrowing transactions. This provision may limit the use of intercompany transactions between HSBC Bank USA and us which may impact our current funding, hedging and overall risk management strategies.
Consumer Regulation.  The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with a broad range of powers to administer and enforce a new federal regulatory framework of consumer financial regulation, including the authority to regulate credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services and providers of those products and services. The CFPB has the authority to issue regulations to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with consumer financial products or services and to ensure features of any consumer financial products or services are fully, accurately and effectively disclosed to consumers. We are subject to CFPB examination and regulation.
With respect to certain laws governing the provision of consumer financial products by national banks such as our affiliate HSBC Bank USA, the Dodd-Frank Act codified the current judicial standard of federal preemption with respect to national banks but added procedural steps to be followed by the OCC when considering preemption determinations after July 21, 2011. Furthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act removed the ability of subsidiaries or agents of a national bank to claim federal preemption of consumer financial laws, although the legislation did not purport to affect existing contracts. These limitations on federal preemption may elevate our costs of compliance, while increasing litigation expenses as a result of potential state Attorneys General or plaintiff challenges and the risk of courts not giving deference to the OCC as well as increasing complexity due to the lack of uniformity

HSBC Finance Corporation

in state law. The extent to which the limitations on federal preemption will impact our businesses and those of our competitors remains uncertain. As a result of the sale of the Card and Retail Services business to Capital One Financial Corporation ("Capital One") in May 2012, it is unlikely these limitations will have a significant impact on us as we no longer have open credit card accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act contains many other consumer-related provisions including provisions addressing mortgage reform.
Competition  As discussed above, all of our remaining operations are in run-off. The competitive conditions of the markets in which we historically operated for the origination of new receivables no longer have a significant impact on our financial results, although the overall reduction of lending offerings to our historical target market segment has reduced the availability of re-finance offerings to our current customers. As of December 31, 2016, our entire real estate secured receivable portfolio is classified as held for sale. We compete against the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other banks who are also selling sub-prime receivable portfolios to attract potential buyers. Potential buyers of these receivables include other banks, asset managers, hedge funds, private equity firms and other investors.
