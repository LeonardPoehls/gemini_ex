Overview
 
HealthWarehouse.com, Inc. ("HEWA" or the "Company") is an online mail order pharmacy, licensed and/or authorized to sell and deliver prescription in 50 states and the District of Columbia focusing on the out-of-pocket prescription drug market, a market which is expected to grow to over $51 billion in 2017. HealthWarehouse.com is currently 1 of 41 Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Websites ("VIPPS") accredited by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy ("NABP") open to all. The Company won the 2015 BizRate Circle of Excellence Award for outstanding customer service and satisfaction along with 186 other major online retailers, the fourth time since its inception and was prominently featured in articles by two nationally recognized consumer magazines during the fourth quarter of 2015 as having the lowest price among top US pharmacies for five commonly prescribed medications. The Company markets a complete range of generic, brand name, and pet prescription medications as well as over-the-counter ("OTC") medications and products.
 Consumers who pay out of pocket for their prescriptions include those with:
 •     no insurance coverage;
 •     high insurance deductibles or copays;
 •     Medicare Part D plans with high deductibles;
 •     Health Savings Accounts (HSA) or Flexible Savings Accounts (FSA);
 •     insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with high deductibles;
 •     drug exclusions and quantity restrictions placed by insurance companies.
 
Our objectives are to utilize our proprietary technology to make the pharmaceutical supply chain more efficient and to pass the savings on to the consumer.  We are becoming known by consumers as a convenient, reliable, discount provider of over-the-counter products and prescription medications. We intend to continue to expand our product line as our business grows. Our customers include uninsured, under-insured, and insured consumers with high insurance co-payments who rely on our service for their daily prescription medications.  With many brand name drug patents continuing to expire over the next several years and a general trend of rising insurance co-payments and deductibles, our service is expanding to mainstream insured consumers of prescription medications, as the market continues to move away from brand name prescription drugs to generics.  Accordingly, we are focused on cash paying customers and do not accept consumer insurance as a form of payment.
Historical Background
 In March 2007, Hwareh.com, Inc. ("Old HW"), a Delaware corporation formerly named HealthWarehouse.com, Inc., was incorporated to carry on the business of selling OTC products. In November 2007, we began to develop the proprietary software necessary for our business, and in February 2008, version 1.0 of the http://www.healthwarehouse.com website was successfully launched running on our own proprietary software.
 In March 2008, as part of our expansion into prescription drugs, we completed construction of a full service licensed pharmacy within our warehouse in Loveland, Ohio. This pharmacy passed inspection by the Ohio State Pharmacy Board in April 2008.
 Effective August 5, 2009, we changed our corporate name to HealthWarehouse.com, Inc., simultaneously with our name change, we changed the corporate name of our subsidiary to Hwareh.com, Inc.  In connection with the name change, we also obtained a new ticker symbol for quotation, and our common stock currently trades on the OTCQB Market under the symbol, "HEWA."
  On February 14, 2011, Hocks Acquisition Corporation ("Hocks Acquisition"), a wholly-owned subsidiary we formed for the purpose of the acquisition, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with Hocks Pharmacy of Hocks Pharmacy, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Hocks Pharmacy"), to purchase, for $200,000 in cash all of the inventory and fixed assets owned by Hocks Pharmacy and used in the operation of its internet pharmacy business (the "Internet Business).  The Internet Business consists primarily of the internet sale of over-the-counter health and medical products and supplies.   That same day, we acquired all of the intangible assets of the Internet Business, including domain names and customer accounts, in a reverse merger of Hocks Acquisition into Hocks.com Inc. ("Hocks.com"), a newly formed Ohio corporation and then wholly-owned subsidiary of Hocks Pharmacy.  As a result, Hocks.com Inc. became our wholly-owned subsidiary.

On June 15, 2011, the Company commenced a lease on a new facility in Florence, KY. On August 1, 2011, the Company transferred its operations to the new facility in Florence, KY.
Our Business Model
 Our business model seeks to improve both the efficiency and convenience by which consumers obtain prescription medications.  To increase efficiency, we make efforts to source products from either the manufacturer or wholesaler level, eliminating unnecessary costs associated with distribution. In addition, we distribute medications to the consumer from a single warehouse, as opposed to retail locations, which we believe eliminates unnecessary costs such as real estate, rents, inventory, and personnel.  By going directly to the consumer via the Internet, we reduce our marketing expense and increase convenience for consumers, especially those taking maintenance medications for conditions ranging from diabetes to high blood pressure.

Our target is consumers who are paying out-of-pocket for their medications.  Out-of-pocket consumers have increased significantly since insurance co-pays are rising and high deductible plans are becoming more prevalent.
 
Our VIPPS Accredited Online Pharmacy
 We operate a full-service online pharmacy within our warehouse in Florence, Kentucky, 15 miles south of Cincinnati, Ohio.  The pharmacy includes two robotic machines.  Our pharmacy passed inspection by the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy, and we are presently licensed as a mail-order pharmacy for sales to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. Territories and APO/FPO military and embassy addresses.
 Our online pharmacy offers the following advantages:
  
● Legitimacy. We have obtained state licenses and certifications to separate ourselves from the numerous uncertified "rogue" pharmacies that exist online. We are the 19th pharmacy in the U.S. to receive Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites accreditation, issued by the National Association of Board of Pharmacy. Google, Yahoo, and Bing now all require VIPPS as a prerequisite to advertise on their sites. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● Convenience. Our easy-to-use online store is available to consumers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through the Internet and includes a robust product search engine and a variety of features, like auto-refill. We deliver medications to any location in the United States including Alaska and Hawaii and offer 6-month and 12-month supplies of medications to reduce the need for refills. All of our products are also available for purchase by phone. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● Selection. Due to our online structure, we are able to offer a significantly broader assortment of products, with greater depth in each product category, because we do not have the shelf display space limitations of brick-and-mortar drugstores. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● Information. We provide a broad array of interactive tools and information on our website to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions. Our information services include detailed product information pages, product user manuals and brochures, detailed product descriptions which contain the manufacturer's phone number, and customer reviews. Our customer support representatives are available by phone or email to answer customers' questions. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● Privacy. When shopping at a "brick-and-mortar" drugstore, many consumers may feel embarrassed or uncomfortable about buying items or asking questions that may reveal personally sensitive aspects of their health or lifestyle to pharmacists, store personnel, or other shoppers. Our customers avoid these problems by shopping from the privacy of their home or office. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● Value. Our goal is to offer shoppers a broad assortment of generic drugs and health products with competitive pricing. We strive to improve our operating efficiencies and to leverage our fixed costs so that we can pass along the savings to our customers in the form of lower prices and exclusive deals. Since we source drugs directly from manufacturers and wholesalers and eliminate third party payors such as insurance companies, we believe that we have lower costs than traditional pharmacies. We also strive to inform customers of additional cost-saving opportunities when they become available. For example, we show the generic equivalents of all brand name products and also offer 6 and 12 month supplies of our medications to consumers to reduce refills and provide better value. The Company was prominently featured in two nationally recognized consumer magazines during the fourth quarter of 2015 as having the lowest price among top pharmacies for five commonly prescribed medications. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● Customer Service. We keenly focus on customer service and endeavor to lead the industry in our policies and procedures. We are prevented by law from accepting returns for prescription medications. The Company has received numerous awards for customer service and satisfaction and won the 2015 BizRate Circle of Excellence Award for outstanding customer service and satisfaction along with 186 other major online retailers, the fourth time since its inception. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our customer support representatives operate from our call center in Florence, Kentucky, available 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday.  Customers can contact us via e-mail,  fax and telephone, plus our online Help Center outlines store policies and provides answers to customers' frequently asked questions.
 We ship our products to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. Territories, and APO/FPO military and embassy addresses. We process all orders from our distribution center in Florence, Kentucky, 15 miles south of Cincinnati, Ohio. Our logistics operation is also based there to maintain proximity to UPS, located 90 miles away in Louisville, Kentucky.  Processing from this location allows us to reach up to 80% of the U.S. population by standard ground shipping in two days from shipment date.
 Marketing and Sales
 Our marketing strategy aims to build brand recognition, increase customer traffic to our online store, add new customers, build strong customer loyalty, maximize repeat purchases and develop incremental revenue opportunities.  In addition, we focus on providing fast, transparent prescription delivery to help increase word of mouth marketing by consumers to their colleagues, friends and family.  Search engine marketing with Google Bing and Yahoo as well as targeted areas like Google Shopping, all require VIPPS accreditation for advertisers.  As a VIPPS accredited pharmacy licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia that sells to consumers online, we believe this provides the Company with a unique avenue to reach customers with limited competition.  The Company also partners with data aggregators such as GoodRx that direct consumers to HealthWarehouse.com for prescription medications and other medical supplies.  We also utilize social media, including Facebook and Twitter as a way to reach consumers to build a dialogue with them.  The Company began a public relations campaign in 2015 and was prominently featured in two nationally recognized consumer magazines during the fourth quarter of 2015 as having the lowest price among top pharmacies for five commonly prescribed medications.
Suppliers
 There are several suppliers available for the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products that we sell. Our principal suppliers are Amerisource Bergen, Cardinal Health, Top Rx and Attain Med, Inc. as well as many direct manufacturers. While we source our supplies from a limited number of suppliers, we do not believe that our business is dependent on any one supplier since the products that we sell are readily available from several alternative suppliers.  Even if a significant supplier were to no longer be available to us, we believe that we could source replacement product through one or more alternative suppliers without having a significant effect on our business.

Customers
 We sell directly to individual consumers who purchase prescription medications and OTC products over the Internet.  Rising insurance co-pays and high deductible plans have caused more consumers to pay out-of-pocket.  This market is expected to grow to over $51 billion by the end of 2017.
Competition
 The market for prescription and OTC health products is intensely competitive and highly fragmented.   However, there are fewer competitors focusing on the out-of-pocket prescription market.  Our competitors in the segment include chain drugstores, mail order pharmacies, pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs), mass market retailers, warehouse clubs and supermarkets. Many of these potential competitors in the market are also established organizations with greater access to resources and capital. In addition, we face competition from foreign online pharmacies that can often sell drugs to U.S. residents at a lower price because they do not comply with U.S. pharmacy regulations, are not subject to U.S. regulatory oversight, or both. We also compete with Internet portals and online service providers that feature shopping services and with other online or mail-order retailers that offer products similar or the same to those that we sell.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market includes brand awareness and preference, company credibility, product selection and availability, convenience, price, actual or perceived value, website features, functionality and performance, ease of purchasing, customer service, privacy, quality and quantity of information supporting purchase decisions (such as product information and reviews), reliability and speed of order shipment.
 Intellectual Property and Technology
 We have implemented a broad array of services and systems for website management, product searching, customer interaction, transaction processing, and order fulfillment functions. These services and systems use a combination of our own proprietary technologies, open-source technologies and commercially-available, licensed technologies.
 We focus our internal development efforts on creating and enhancing the specialized, proprietary software that is unique to our business.  For example, our core merchandise catalog, as well as our customer interaction, order collection, fulfillment and back-end systems are proprietary to us. Our systems are designed to provide real-time connectivity to our distribution center systems for both pharmacy and OTC products. They include an inventory tracking system, a real-time order tracking system, and an inventory replenishment system.
 Our website at http://www.healthwarehouse.com is developed using readily available open source technologies and is hosted on Google Cloud Services (GCS) due to the platform's perceived cost effectiveness and scalability. Due to Google's lengthy experience at running servers capable of serving one of the largest commerce sites on the web, our site remains scalable on days when our traffic spikes.  Our open source platform runs on Linux, Nginx, MySQL and PHP (LEMP).
 We filed for a trademark on the name "HealthWarehouse.com" on August 14, 2007 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which trademark was granted with a registration date of May 19, 2009.  On February 14, 2011, we acquired the registered trademark "Hocks.com" in connection with our purchase of the online reseller business of Hocks Pharmacy Inc.  We also rely on trade secret law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property, and we do not intend to seek patent or copyright protection for our intellectual property at this time.
 Government Regulation
 Federal and state laws and regulations govern many aspects of our business and are specific to pharmacies and the sale of OTC drugs. Our pharmacy passed inspection by the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy and we are presently licensed as a mail-order pharmacy for sales to 50 states and the District of Columbia. We ship our non-prescription products to all 50 states, U.S. Territories, and APO/FPO military and embassy addresses.
 We believe the Company is in substantial compliance with all existing legal and regulatory requirements material to the operation of our business and have standard operating procedures and controls in place designed to assist in ensuring compliance with existing contractual requirements and state and federal law. We diligently monitor and audit our adherence to these procedures and controls and take prompt corrective and disciplinary action when appropriate. However, we cannot predict how courts or regulatory agencies may interpret existing laws or regulations or what additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future regarding healthcare or the pharmacy industry, and the application of complex standards to the operation of our business creates areas of uncertainty.

In addition, although we presently do not accept insurance reimbursement nor do we participate in federal and state programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, this may change in the future. If in the future we do accept reimbursement from commercial or governmental payers, we would be subject to extensive government regulation including numerous state and federal laws and corresponding regulations directed at preventing fraud and abuse and regulating reimbursement.
 Among the federal and state laws and regulations that currently affect or may reasonably affect in the future aspects of our business are the following:
 Regulation of Our Pharmacy Operations
 The practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy. Our pharmacy must be licensed in the state in which it is located. In some states, regulations require compliance with standards promulgated by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).  The USP creates standards in the packaging, storage and shipping of pharmaceuticals.  Also, many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals, including controlled substances, have laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail-order pharmacies to register with that state's board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body. In addition, some states have proposed laws to regulate online pharmacies; we may be subject to this legislation if passed. Furthermore, if our pharmacy dispenses durable medical equipment items, such as infusion pumps, that bear a federal legend requiring dispensing pursuant to a prescription, we would also be regulated by applicable state and federal durable medical equipment laws.
 Federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations. Pharmacies must register with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances. We sell controlled substances and therefore require a DEA license and maintain said DEA license. In addition, the FDA inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also has requirements for mail-order sellers of goods. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that could have an adverse effect on our mail-order operations.  The USPS historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances. If the USPS restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail, alternative means of delivery are available to us.  However, alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive. The Department of Transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce. These regulations generally do not apply to the USPS and its operations.
 Additionally, under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and related state and local regulations, our pharmacists are required to offer counseling to our customers about medication, dosage, delivery systems, common side effects, adverse effects or interactions and therapeutic contraindications, proper storage, prescription refill and other information deemed significant by the pharmacists.  We are also subject to requirements under the Controlled Substances Act and federal DEA regulations, as well as related state and local laws and regulations, relating to our pharmacy operations, including registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to the purchase, storage and dispensing of controlled substances, prescription drugs and some OTC drugs.
 "Compendial standards," which can also be called "official compendium," means the standards for drugs related to strength, purity, weight, quality, labeling and packing contained in the USP, official National Formulary, or any supplement to any of them. Under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, a drug recognized by the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States must meet all compendial standards and labeling requirements contained therein, or it will be considered adulterated (for example, lacking appropriate strength, quality or purity; or containing poisonous or unsanitary ingredients) or misbranded (for example, having a false or misleading label; or a label containing an inaccurate description of contents).  If we add homeopathic remedies to our product offerings, we will be required to comply with the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The distribution of adulterated or misbranded homeopathic remedies or other drugs is prohibited under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and violations could result in substantial fines and other monetary penalties, seizure of the misbranded or adulterated items, and/or criminal sanctions.
 We also are required to comply with the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) when selling dietary supplements and vitamins.  The DSHEA generally governs the production, sale and marketing (including labeling) of dietary supplements, and it requires reporting to the FDA of certain adverse events regarding dietary supplements.
 We believe that our operations have the appropriate licenses required under the laws of the states in which they are located, and that we conduct our pharmacy operations in accordance with the laws and regulations of these states.

Drug Importation
 In the face of escalating costs for plan sponsors providing a prescription drug benefit for their employees, and uninsured individuals seeking to lower their drug costs, the issue of importing drugs from Canada or other foreign countries has received significant attention. Drug importation, sometimes called drug re-importation, occurs when prescription medicines from other countries are imported for personal use or commercial distribution. Individual importation activities are generally prohibited under U.S. law, and the FDA has issued warnings and safety alerts to a number of entities seeking to promote or facilitate systematic importation activities.  However, there has been considerable legislative and political activity seeking to change the FDA requirements to enable drug importation, and we are evaluating appropriate actions if such legislation were to be enacted.
Health Management Services Regulation
 All states regulate the practice of medicine and require licensing under applicable state law. It is not our intent to practice medicine and we have attempted to structure our website and our business to avoid violation of state licensing requirements.  However, the application of this area of the law to Internet services such as ours is not well established and, accordingly, a state regulatory authority could at some time allege that some portion of our business violates these statutes. Any such allegation could harm our business.  Further, any liability based on a determination that we engaged in the unlawful practice of medicine may be excluded from coverage under the terms of our general liability insurance policy.
Consumer Protection Laws
 Most states have consumer protection laws designed to ensure that information provided to consumers is adequate, fair and not misleading. We believe that our practices conform to the requirements of state consumer protection laws. However, we may be subject to further scrutiny under these laws as they are often interpreted broadly.
Regulation Relating to Data Transmission and Confidentiality of Patient Identifiable Information
 Dispensing of prescriptions and management of prescription drug benefits require the ability to utilize patient-specific information. Government regulation of the use of patient identifiable information has grown substantially over the past several years.  At the federal level, Congress enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which extensively regulates the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by all participants in healthcare delivery, including physicians, hospitals, insurers and other payers.  To the extent that our pharmacy operations engage in certain electronic transactions (including claims for reimbursement by third-party payers), we may be a covered entity which is directly subject to these requirements.  Additionally, regulation of the use of patient-identifiable information is likely to increase. Congress is currently reviewing proposals that would alter HIPAA, which would create additional administrative burdens. Many states have passed or are considering laws addressing the use and disclosure of health information. These proposals vary widely, some relating to only certain types of information, others to only certain uses, and yet others to only certain types of entities.  These laws and regulations have a significant impact on our operations, products and services, and compliance with them is a major operational requirement.  Regulations and legislation that severely restrict or prohibit our use of patient identifiable information could materially adversely affect our business.
 Sanctions for failing to comply with HIPAA standards include criminal and civil penalties. If we are found to have violated any state or federal statute or regulation with regard to the confidentiality, dissemination or use of patient medical information, we could be liable for significant damages, fines or penalties.
 Fraudulent Billing, Anti-Kickback, Stark, Civil Monetary Penalties and False Claims Laws and Regulations
 Our operations may in the future participate in federal and state programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. If we do, we would be subject to extensive government regulation including numerous state and federal laws and corresponding regulations directed at preventing fraud and abuse and regulating reimbursement. The government's Medicare and Medicaid regulations are complex and sometimes subjective and therefore may require our management's interpretation. If we were to participate in federal and state programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, our compliance with Medicare and Medicaid regulations may be reviewed by federal or state agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the FDA. To ensure compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other regulations, government agencies conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with various supplier standards and billing requirements. Similarly, regional health insurance carriers routinely conduct audits and request patient records and other documents to support claims submitted for payment.

TABLE OF CONTENTS




Federal law prohibits the payment, offer, receipt or solicitation of any remuneration that is knowingly and willfully intended to induce the referral of Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare program beneficiaries for the purchase, lease, ordering or recommendation of the purchase, lease or ordering of items or services reimbursable under federal healthcare programs. These laws are commonly referred to as anti-remuneration or anti-kickback laws. Several states also have similar laws, known as "all payer" statutes, which impose anti-kickback prohibitions on services covered by any third-party payer (whether or not a federal healthcare program). Anti-kickback laws vary between states, and courts have rarely interpreted them.  If in the future we accept third-party reimbursement, we may be subject to these laws.
 Courts, the OIG and some administrative tribunals have broadly interpreted the federal anti-kickback statute and regulations.  Courts have ruled that a violation of the statute may occur even if only one of the purposes of a payment arrangement is to induce patient referrals or purchases.  Should we enter the government payer sector, it is possible that our current practices in the commercial sector may not be appropriate in the government payer sector.
 The Ethics in Patient Referrals Law (Stark Law) prohibits physicians from making a referral for certain Medicare-covered health items or services if they, or their family members, have a financial relationship with the entity receiving the referral. No bill may be submitted in connection with a prohibited referral. Violations are punishable by civil monetary penalties upon both the person making the referral and the provider rendering the service. Such persons or entities are also subject to exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid.  Many states have adopted laws similar to the Stark Law, which restrict the ability of physicians to refer patients to entities with which they have a financial relationship.
 The Federal False Claims Act prohibits the submission of a false claim or the making of a false record or statement in order to secure a reimbursement from a government-sponsored program. In recent years, the federal government has launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws. Civil monetary penalties may be assessed for many types of conduct, including conduct that is outlined in the statutes above and other federal statutes in this section. Under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), states are encouraged to pass state false claims act laws similar to the federal statute.
 Sanctions for fraudulent billing, kickback violations, Stark Law violations or violations of the False Claims Act include criminal and civil penalties. If we do accept third-party reimbursement and/or participate in federal payer programs in the future and are found to have violated any state or federal kickback, Stark Law or False Claims Act law, we could be liable for significant damages, fines or penalties and potentially be ineligible to participate in federal payer programs.
 Legislation and Regulation Affecting Drug Prices and Potentially Affecting the Market for Prescription Benefit Plans and Reimbursement for Durable Medical Equipment
 Recently, the federal government has increased its focus on the methods drug manufacturers employ to develop pricing information, which in turn is used in setting payments under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  One element common to many payment formulas, the use of "average wholesale price" (AWP) as a standard pricing unit throughout the industry, has been criticized as not accurately reflecting prices actually charged and paid at the wholesale or retail level. The DOJ is currently conducting, and the House Commerce Committee has conducted, an investigation into the use of AWP for federal program reimbursement, and whether the use of AWP has inflated drug expenditures by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating reimbursement of certain drugs by the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 The DRA revised the formula used by the federal government to set the Federal Upper Limit (FUL) for multiple source drugs by adopting 250 percent of the average manufacturer's price (AMP) without regard to customary prompt pay discounts to wholesalers for the least costly therapeutic equivalent. On July 17, 2006, HHS published a Final Rule for the Medicaid Prescription Drug Program implementing the DRA in which AMP was defined to exclude discounts and rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and include sales to mail-order and specialty pharmacies in the AMP calculation by manufacturers.
 These proposals and other legislative or regulatory adjustments that may be made to the program for reimbursement of drugs by Medicare and Medicaid, if implemented, could affect our ability to negotiate discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers. They could also impact the reimbursement we may receive from government payers in the future should we choose to participate in such programs. In addition, they may affect our relationships with health plans. In some circumstances, they might also impact the reimbursement that we would receive from managed care organizations that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits or otherwise elect to rely on the revised pricing information. Furthermore, private payers may choose to follow the government's example and adopt different drug pricing bases. This could affect our ability to negotiate with plans, manufacturers and pharmacies regarding discounts and rebates.

TABLE OF CONTENTS



Relative to our durable medical equipment operations, The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (DIMA), established a program for the competitive acquisition of certain covered items of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (DMEPOS). Diabetes testing supplies, including test strips and lancets, which are commonly supplied via mail-order delivery, are subject to the competitive acquisition program. Only qualified suppliers that meet defined participation standards specified in the final rule will be permitted to engage in the competitive acquisition program. In 2010, mail-order diabetes testing supplies may be subject to a national or regional program, which would require mail-order suppliers to bid on supplying certain DMEPOS items.
Medicare Part D and Part B; State Prescription Drug Assistance Programs
 The DIMA also offers far-reaching changes to the Medicare program. The DIMA established a new Medicare Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit for over 40 million Americans who are eligible for Medicare. Qualified beneficiaries, including senior citizens and disabled individuals, have had the opportunity to enroll in Medicare Part D since January 1, 2006.
 In addition, many states have expanded state prescription drug assistance programs to increase access to drugs by those currently without coverage and/or supplement the Medicare Part D benefit of those with coverage to offer options for a seamless benefit.  In accordance with applicable CMS requirements, to participate we may have to enter into agreements with a number of state prescription drug assistance programs and collaborate to coordinate benefits with Medicare Part D plans.
 If we participate in these state and/or federal payer programs in the future, we will have to comply with the applicable conditions of participation for such plans, may be subject to competitive bidding requirements under such plans, and may be subject to adverse pricing limitations imposed by such plans (including the DRA limits described above).
 Industry Standards for Pharmacy Operations
 The National Committee on Quality Assurance, the American Accreditation Health Care Commission (known as URAC), the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and other quasi-regulatory and accrediting bodies have developed standards relating to services performed by pharmacies, including mail order, formulary, drug utilization management and specialty pharmacy. While the actions of these bodies do not have the force of law, pharmacy benefit managers and many clients for pharmacy benefit manager services seek certification from them, as do other third parties. These bodies may influence the federal government or states to adopt requirements or model acts that they promulgate. The federal government and some states incorporate accreditation standards of these bodies, as well as the standards of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, a coalition of state pharmacy boards, into their drug utilization review regulation. Future initiatives of these bodies are uncertain and resulting standards or legislation could impose restrictions on us in a manner that could significantly impact our business.
 The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy has also developed a program, the Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites, as a model for self-regulation for online pharmacies. The Company has been accredited by VIPPS since 2008.
 
Employees
 
 As of February 15, 2017, we employed 59 full-time employees and 15 part-time employees.  None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that relations with our employees are good. The Company, from time to time, also utilizes independent contractors to supplement its workforce.
