The Company has acquired 3 mares for its breeding operations, Milania, Sweet Dreams and Meta Mu. Milania and Sweet Dreams were pregnant when the company acquired them while Meta Mu was not. For the 2017 breeding seasons the mares will be breed as follows: Milania to War Front, Sweet Dreams to Tapit and Meta Mu to American Pharoah (currently being negotiated).

The Company’s total expense to acquire the mares was $520,000 with $733,333 and $91,528 to insure the stud fee for War Front. The Company’s agreement for War Front is a non-guaranteed fee of $330,000 which was paid in December 2016. The Company insured the $330,000 stud fee to convert the non-guarantee into a live foal that stands and nurses guarantee. The stud fees for Sweet Dreams and Meta Mu are Live Foal Stands and Nurses (LSFN) from the stallion farms. 
 
Milania gave birth to her Pioneer of the Nile foal in January 2017. Sweet Dreams is expected to give birth to her Street Car in March 2017. The Company will sell the foals at the Keeneland sale in November 2017 or July 2018.

The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Competition
