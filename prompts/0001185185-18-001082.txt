On March 31, 2013, the Company entered into a Standard Land Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the Mazzal Trust, pursuant to which the Company purchased property (the “Taunton Property”) consisting of “the land and all buildings thereon known as 171 Hart St., Taunton MA 02780.” The Taunton Property consists of approximately 25 acres. The Taunton Property is located in the Green Pines Townhomes subdivision, and the subdivision is managed by the Green Pines Townhomes Condominium Trust. (The manager of the Green Pines Townhomes Condominium Trust is Green Pines, LLC, a shareholder of the Company, the manager of which is Marty Trabelsi, the brother of Nissim Trabelsi, the Company’s President.) The purchase price for the Taunton Property was 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. On May 29, 2013, the purchase of the Taunton Property closed, and the seller delivered the deed, and the Company issued the shares.
 
Global ITS Transaction
 
On October 26, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Global ITS, Inc. (“Global”), a development stage company and the shareholders of Global, pursuant to which the Company exchanged 120,000,000 of its common shares (the “Company Shares”) for 24,000,000 Global common shares held by Global’ s shareholders representing 100% of Global’ s outstanding shares (the “Share Exchange”). Following their issuance, the 120,000,000 shares represented in the aggregate approximately 36% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company became the sole shareholder of Global, and became obligated to issue 120,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Global, a privately held Wyoming development stage corporation, was focused on marketing energy efficiency (“EE”) and commercial security (“CS”) products. Its wholly owned subsidiary, Znergy, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Znergy-FL)”), was focused on financing EE and CS projects for Global’ s customers and for third party projects.  Subsequently, Znergy-FL has become the operating subsidiary for the Company, selling and installing energy efficient lighting.
 
Change in Control Transaction
 
On November 19, 2015, Mr. Nissam Trabelsi, who was serving at the time as the Company’s President and CEO, entered into a binding term sheet (the “Term Sheet”) to sell 100% of his shares of the Company’s common stock to Peter Peterson or entities designated by him for an aggregate purchase price of $500,000, minus certain expenses to be paid prior to closing. Additionally, the Mazzal Trust (the “Trust”), the Company’s largest shareholder at the time, agreed to return to the Company 150,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, in exchange for which the Company transferred all right, title, and interests in and to the Company’s real property located in Taunton, Massachusetts (the “Taunton Property”), to the Trust.
 
Subsequently, on February 9, 2016, following additional negotiations between the parties, the Company, Mr. Trabelsi; Shawn Telsi (a significant shareholder); the Mazzal Living Trust, the majority shareholder of the Company (the “Trust”); and B2 Opportunity Fund, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“B2”), entered into an Amended Master Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Master Agreement”).
 
Pursuant to the Master Agreement, Mr. Trabelsi and Mr. Telsi each agreed to sell 100% of the shares of the Company’s common stock owned by them to B2 or its designees.

In connection with the Master Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to the Trust, and the Trust agreed to purchase from the Company, real property which the Trust had previously sold to the Company, described above as the Taunton Property. Additionally the Company’s subsidiary, Command Control, sold the Hotel Property (collectively with the Taunton Property, the “Property”).  As consideration for the purchase of the Property, the Trust returned to the Company 149,950,000 of the 150,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock owned by the Trust, while retaining 50,000 of the shares.

In connection with the execution of the Master Agreement, the Company canceled the 149,950,000 shares of common stock conveyed by the Trust.
 
The foregoing description of the Master Agreement is qualified in its entirety with reference to the entire agreement, which was been filed as an exhibit to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on February 12, 2016.

In connection with his sale of his and Mr. Telsi’s shares, Mr. Trabelsi appointed Christopher J. Floyd to the Board of Directors of the Company, Mr. Trabelsi also appointed Mr. Floyd as the CEO, CFO, and Secretary of the Company.  Following Mr. Trabelsi’s appointment of Mr. Floyd to the board of directors and as an officer of the Company, Mr. Trabelsi resigned from all positions with the Company, effective immediately.  Mr. Floyd, as the Company’s remaining director, accepted the resignations.
 
In December 2016, Mr. Floyd appointed Arthur E. Fillmore, II, as the second member of the Company’s Board of Directors and as General Counsel to the Company.  Mr. Fillmore was also appointed Chair of the Company’s Compensation Committee.  Mr. Fillmore was granted 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted stock.  At the same time, Mr. Filmore’s law firm, AEGIS Professional Services (new AEGIS Law) was granted 2,000,000 options to purchase the Company’s common stock at $0.10 per shares, vesting immediately, in exchange for AEGIS’ agreement to reduce its hourly billing rate to the Company by 25%.  AEGIS distributed said options of 666,000 to each of Mr. Fillmore, Scott Levine and Nicholas Schopp.
 
There were no disagreements or disputes between Mr. Trabelsi and the Company or the Board of Directors.
 
A copy of Mr. Trabelsi’s notice of resignation was included as an exhibit to the Company’s Current Report filed on February 12, 2016.  The Company provided to Mr. Trabelsi a copy of the Current Report for his review prior to filing.
 
Change in Control
 
In connection with the Master Agreement and the cancellation of the Trust’s shares in connection with the sale of the Property, a change of control of the Company occurred.
 
Immediately prior to the execution of the Master Agreement, the Company had 330,000,000 common shares issued and outstanding. Mr. Trabelsi, through his personal ownership and as Trustee of the Trust, beneficially owned approximately 60% of the outstanding shares.
 
As noted above, in connection with the Master Agreement discussed above, Mr. Trabelsi sold his shares of common stock to B2 or its designees, and the Trust agreed to purchase the Properties from the Company in exchange for 149,950,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, which were canceled by the Company following the closing of the transaction. As such, following the closing of the Master Agreement, the Company had 180,050,000 shares issued and outstanding. As of the date of this Report, to our knowledge, Mr. Trabelsi owned directly, beneficially or indirectly, through the Trust, 200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.
 
As such, a change of control of the Company occurred in connection with the execution of the Master Agreement and the cancellation of the Trust’s shares. As noted, the Global ITS shareholders tendered their shares of Global ITS common stock in exchange for the shares of the Company’s common stock.
 
At the time, Global ITS had approximately 50 shareholders, including Lone Cypress, LLC. Following the distribution of Company’s shares to the Global ITS shareholders, none of the former Global ITS shareholders owned 10% or more of the Company’s shares other than Lone Cypress, which received an aggregate of 41,137,120, which was equal to approximately 23% of the total outstanding shares of the Company. Currently no former Global ITS shareholder owns more than 10% of the Company’s shares.

Overview
 
The Company is a provider of energy-efficient lighting products, lighting controls and energy management solutions. The Company offers a full turn-key lighting solution which includes economic assessments, energy efficient analysis, installation and rebate support for the Company’s customers.  The Company’s business primarily involves retrofitting existing lighting solutions from traditional high intensity fluorescent lighting to energy efficient LED (Light Emitting Diode) technology.
 
Managing energy consumption and the associate costs is increasingly important to building owners.  Technological advancements in LED, together with significant private and public incentives for sustainability initiatives have made lighting infrastructure changes an effective way for building owners to cut energy costs. LED lighting provides energy efficiency, long life, low running temperatures and increasing technology such as dimmable lights.
 
The Company does not have long term contracts with its customers and the Company’s revenue comes from the sales of lighting systems involving the replacement of existing lighting fixtures with new energy efficient LED fixtures. In addition, the Company generates revenue from available utility incentives and rebate programs.
 
The Company provides its turn-key service though a detailed evaluation of the customer’s needs and performing an audit of the customer’s current energy consumptions and costs, together with an analysis of the benefits of retrofitting their lights.  Typically, the customer experiences an average payback on their investment between 12 and 24 months.
 
The Company intends to grow organically by selling energy efficiency (EE) and commercial security (CS) products to industrial and commercial businesses as well as municipal and state governments, universities and colleges, K-12 schools, and hospitals (the “MUSH” market). Strained government budgets have convinced state and local governments across the United States to embrace a new form of performance-based investments in energy efficiency offered by Energy Services Companies, or ESCOs. An ESCO provides energy-efficiency-related and other value-added services and for which performance contracting is a core part of its energy-efficiency services business. In a performance contract, the ESCO guarantees energy or financial savings for the project, which means ESCOs only make money if the project performs as promised. A study prepared by Allied Market Research indicated that the market is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 13.76% during the forecast period 2014-2020 and reach $44.4 billion by 2020.
 
The Company increases its competitive position by providing funding for EE projects through its strategic partnership with a well-established funding group focused on energy efficiency projects.
 
In addition, the Company will look for accretive acquisitions in the diverse and fragmented EE marketplace

Financing Strategy
 
The Company only recently has begun to generate revenue from the sale of its services and from rebate income.  The Company has invested in additional sales staff and has incurred costs developing its customer auditing process.  These expenses are partially funded by cash flow from its revenues, but the Company is currently operating below break-even due to its operating investments.  As a result, the Company had to rely on additional debt, primarily from its shareholders.  The Company anticipates that it will continue to fund its operations through the revenue it derives from services and rebates but will also need to finance its needs through additional debt and through the sale of its shares of common stock, which will result in dilution to the current owners of the Company’s shares.  There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful and raising additional debt or to sell additional securities, or that such offerings, if successful will provide the Company with sufficient capital to implement its business plan.
Competition
 
The energy efficiency segment for small and medium sized commercial businesses is fragmented and highly competitive. The Company competes with various types and sizes of companies ranging from local and national service providers.
 
The efficient lighting market, which is part of the energy efficiency market, is also highly competitive, with some of the largest suppliers of lighting components also serving many of the same markets and competing for the same customers. Competition is based on numerous factors, including features and benefits, brand name recognition, product quality, product and lighting system design, energy efficiency, customer relationships, service capabilities, and price. The Company’s largest competitors in the North American lighting market include the lighting divisions of Acuity Brands, Koninklijke Philips N.V., Eaton Corporation, Hubbell Incorporated, Schneider Electric, Cree, Inc., and General Electric Company. The Company estimates that the largest publicly traded manufacturers, which participate in varying degrees in the North American lighting market, have over half of the total market share. In addition to these large competitors, the Company also competes with hundreds of manufacturers of varying size.
