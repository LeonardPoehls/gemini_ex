Principal Products, Services and Their Markets
 
As described above in this Part I, Item 1, we have ownership interests in Worx, Amuli and Tieshan Oil.
 
Worx designs automated solutions for industrial, environmental and energy industries to improve efficiency and systems output. The Worx automated robotic tank cleaning system reduces tank cleaning time, reduces or eliminates the need for personnel to enter tanks, and may reduce the volume of solvents used to clean a tank. Actual results vary from tank to tank and may involve variables including the product in the tank, physical condition of the tank such as corrosion, or amount of sludge accumulated. Worx is currently refining its product line to improve speed and efficiency, and our investment in Worx has facilitated this development. We hope to utilize this important technology for deployment into commercial markets in China and greater Asia. 
 
Amuli is in development to become a large producer of the health beverage drink Kvass. Amuli has purchased equipment and is currently expanding its production facilities that are forecasted to generate sales and profits in 2018.
 
Tieshan Oil is principally engaged in the trading of oil, gas and lubricant products within the PRC. During the year ended January 31, 2018, one customer accounted for approximately 99% of revenues of Tieshan Oil. During the year ended January 31, 2017, one customer accounted for approximately 49% of revenues of Tieshan Oil. As of January 31, 2018, two customers accounted for approximately 99% of accounts receivable. As of January 31, 2017, two customers accounted for approximately 87% of accounts receivable. The concentrations of credit risk as of January 31, 2018 was higher than that of January 31, 2017.
 
We are also seeking additional global investment opportunities in emerging companies with products that have potential for expanding regional and international sales and revenues.
 
Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Resort Savers’ Position in the Industry
 
Barriers to entry in the industry is extremely low and there are many competitors. Our core business is the acquisition of cash-generating businesses, or businesses which we believe will generate cash in the near term, and we primarily use our capital stock as consideration in such acquisitions. Our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do, including sufficient cash to pay consideration for acquisitions. There are no assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be successful or that we will continue to be able to compete with other funds, companies or other sources of capital to secure competitive acquisition targets and consummate future transactions. 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Agreements or Contracts
 
There are no aspects of our business plan which require a patent, trademark, or product license. We have not entered into any vendor agreements or contracts that give or could give rise to any obligations or concessions.
Research and Development Activities and Costs
 
We have spent no time on specialized research and development activities and have no plans to undertake any research or development in the future.
 
Number of Employees
 
Resort Savers has 10 full-time employees and we do not anticipate hiring more employees in the near future. None of our Officers and/or Directors have signed any employment agreement, or any other agreement containing provisions related to financial remuneration for services, with the Company.

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
