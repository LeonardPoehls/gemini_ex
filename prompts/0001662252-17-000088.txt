Forward-Looking Statements
 
Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain.
 
Description of Our Company
 
Company Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 31, 2013 as Artesanias Corp. Our original business plan involved distribution of the arts and crafts of the indigenous tribes of Panama via the Internet. On January 20, 2015, we underwent a change in control when our former majority shareholder and sole officer, Jose Soto, sold his controlling interest and resigned after appointing our current CEO and Director, Chitan Mistry, and our former CFO and Director, Lucie Lettelier. Following the change in control, we are no longer pursuing our original business plan. On June 12, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company changed the name from Artesanias Corp. to SocialPlay USA, Inc. to reflect the business focus of the Company.
 
On April 27, 2015, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Social Play, Inc. (“Social Play”). Under the Agreement, we have been granted the exclusive rights within the U.S. and Canada to develop, market and sell products and services based upon Social Play’s patent-pending “SP Cloud Goods” system. SP Cloud Goods is cloud-based game hosting and management system where video game developers can add and remove virtual goods from the game, manage players, manage virtual store pricing, and view vital game and player statistics.  Using this system, game developers can affect their games in real-time, without the need to rebuild or republish the game. The SP Cloud Goods intellectual property also includes a system for game developers to collect payments for virtual goods sold to players in their games, as well as a marketplace component that will allow advertisers and game developers to choose where, when, and how advertisements are placed in games. The system will also facilitate the transfer of funds from advertisers to game developers.
 
The Agreement runs for an initial term of five (5) years, with an optional extension for an additional five years. In consideration for the license, we agreed to issue Social Play 1,000,000 (200,000 after reverse split) shares of common stock and an additional 1,000,000 (200,000 after reverse split) shares on each anniversary of the Agreement for so long as it is in effect. Further, we agreed to make cash payments to Social Play in the total amount of $120,000, payable in monthly payments of not less than $20,000 until paid in full.
 
On August 22, 2016, the board of directors appointed Robert Rosner as our new President, CEO, CFO and Director. Following these appointments, the board accepted the resignation of Chitan Mistry as our former sole officer and director.
 
Letter of Intent with Spot and Play, Inc.
 On March 11, 2017, we entered into a binding Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) with Spot and Play, Inc. (“Spot and Play”) and its sole shareholder, Karthik Mani. Spot and Play is developing the “Spot and Pay” application, which provides a way to centralize payment or donate money using a unique business code in form of a visual code at location, or using business name if remote. The LOI contemplates our acquisition of up to 100% of Spot and Play for a total purchase price of $1,000,000. Our initial investment will consist of $300,000 in cash, to be paid for a 30% ownership interest in Spot and Play. These funds are to be paid as follows: (i) $50,000 to be paid upon execution of the LOI, (ii) an additional $100,000 to be paid upon certain development milestones for Spot and Play’s business, and no later than 15 days after the execution of a definitive agreement, and (iii) the final $150,000 upon Spot and Play’s achievement of certain additional milestones, and no later than 75 days after the execution of a definitive agreement.

Further, we will be granted the exclusive option to purchase the remaining 70% of Spot and Play to be paid as follows: (i) issuance of shares of our common stock valued at $200,000, no later than 150 days from execution of a definitive agreement, in order to purchase an additional 19% of Spot and Play, and (ii) issuance of shares of our common stock valued at $500,000, no later than 180 days from execution of a definitive agreement, in order to purchase the remaining 51% of Spot and Play. Shares issued as purchase consideration will be valued based on the five-day average trading price of our common stock immediately preceding their issuance. Shares to be issued as consideration for our acquisition of Spot and Play will be subject to a one (1) year lock-up, with certain leak-out restrictions on their re-sale thereafter. Upon our acquisition of 100% of the ownership interests in Spot and Play, Mr. Mani will be granted a royalty based on the gross profits of Spot and Play, with specific royalty terms to be negotiated. The transaction contemplated by the LOI is subject to final negotiation of a definitive agreement, requisite corporate approvals, and other conditions. Under the LOI, we have the exclusive rights, through March 31, 2017, to negotiate and conclude an acquisition agreement for Spot and Play.
