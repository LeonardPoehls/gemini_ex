ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
FTS International, Inc. (the Company, we, our) was originally formed in 2000. We are one of the largest providers of hydraulic fracturing services in North America. Our services enhance hydrocarbon flow from oil and natural gas wells drilled by E&P companies in shale and other unconventional resource formations. Our customers include Chesapeake Energy Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources, Inc., Diamondback Energy Inc., EQT Company, Range Resources Corporation, and other leading E&P companies that specialize in unconventional oil and natural gas resources in North America.
 
We have 1.6 million total hydraulic horsepower across 32 fleets, with 27 fleets active as of December 31, 2017. As one of the largest hydraulic fracturing service providers in North America, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the recovery of the North American oil and natural gas exploration and production market.
 
We are one of the top three hydraulic fracturing providers across our operating footprint, which consists of five of the most active major unconventional basins in the United States: the Permian Basin, the SCOOP/STACK Formation, the Marcellus/Utica Shale, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Haynesville Shale. Our market share and our large-scale operating presence across a variety of active basins provides us with important strategic advantages, such as: the ability to serve large, multi-basin customers; better negotiating power with our customers and suppliers; reduced volatility in our activity levels as completions activity endures cycles in different basins; and a lower relative cost structure for fixed overhead and corporate costs.
 
The following map shows the basins in which we operate and the number of fleets operated from each basin as of December 31, 2017.
 

We are experiencing a surge in demand for our services, which has led us to reactivate 10 fleets since the beginning of 2017. Based on continued requests from customers for additional fleets, we are in the process of reactivating additional equipment at our in-house manufacturing facility. The surge in demand for our services has allowed us to raise prices significantly. Oil prices have more than doubled since the 12-year low of $26.14 in February 2016, reaching a high of $64.89 in January 2018 and averaging $50.80 in 2017. Similarly, the U.S. horizontal rig count has increased by 155%, from a low of 314 rigs as of May 27, 2016 to 802 rigs as of January 19, 2018, according to an industry report. The large growth in E&P drilling activity has caused demand for pressure pumping services to exceed the supply of readily available fleets, which has led average pricing for our services to rise more than approximately 56% from the fourth quarter of 2016. These price increases started in January 2017 and continued to progress to higher levels throughout 2017.
 
During the last two years, we implemented measures to reduce our operating costs and to improve our operating efficiency, including reducing the number of our active fleets as demand for our services declined. We focused on our ability to operate our active fleets for as many hours per day and days per month as possible in order to limit the non-productive time of our active fleets. As a result, we have increased our average stages per active fleet per quarter to record levels. These operational improvements occurred despite significant reductions in our operating costs, including reducing our quarterly selling, general and administrative expense by approximately 60% from 2014 levels.
 
We maintained these improved cost and efficiency levels in 2017, which, combined with the recent rise in pricing for our services, allowed us to achieve EBITDA levels greater than what we experienced in 2014. We achieved these results despite having
 
1




considerably lower pricing and fewer active fleets on average than we had in 2014. We believe we can continue to sustain these cost reductions and efficiency improvements as activity levels increase.
 
Our customers typically compensate us based on the number of stages fractured and the primary contributor to the number of stages we complete is our ability to reduce downtime on our equipment. As a result, we believe the number of stages fractured and the average number of stages completed per active fleet in a given period of time are important operating metrics for our business. The graphs below show the number of stages we completed per quarter and the average stages per active fleet we completed per quarter. For additional information regarding our fleet capacity and average stages per active fleet per quarter as an operating metric, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of OperationsRevenue and Our ServicesHydraulic Fracturing in Item 7 of this annual report.
 

We manufacture and refurbish many of the components used by our fleets, including consumables, such as fluid-ends. We also perform substantially all the maintenance, repair and refurbishment of our hydraulic fracturing fleets, including the reactivation of idle equipment. Our cost to produce components and reactivate fleets is significantly less than the cost to purchase comparable quality components and fleets from third-party suppliers. For example, we manufacture fluid-ends and power-ends at a cost that is approximately 50% to 60% less than purchasing them from outside suppliers. We estimate that our cost advantage saves us approximately $85 million per year at peak production levels. In addition, we perform full-scale refurbishments of our fracturing units at a cost that is approximately half the cost of utilizing an outside supplier.
 
Our manufacturing capabilities also reduce the risk that we will be unable to source important components, such as fluid-ends, power-ends and other consumable parts. During periods of high demand for hydraulic fracturing services, external equipment vendors often report order backlogs of up to nine months. Our competitors may be unable to source components when needed or may be required to pay a much higher price for their components, or both, due to bottlenecks in supplier production levels. We have historically manufactured, and believe we have the capacity to manufacture, all major consumable components required to operate all 32 of our fleets at full capacity. We designed and assembled all of our 32 existing fleets using internal resources and we believe we could assemble new fleets internally at a substantial discount to the cost of buying them new from third-party providers.
 
We have a uniform fleet of hydraulic fracturing equipment. We designed our equipment to uniform specifications intended specifically for completions work in oil and natural gas basins requiring high levels of pressure, flow rate and sand intensity. The standardized, plug and play nature of our fleet provides us with several advantages, including: reduced repair and maintenance costs; reduced inventory costs; the ability to redeploy equipment among operating basins; and reduced complexity in our operations, which improves our safety and operational performance.
 
Our large scale and culture of innovation allows us to take advantage of leading technological solutions. We have been a fast adopter of new technologies focused on: increasing fracturing effectiveness for our customers, reducing the operating costs of our equipment and enhancing the HSE conditions at our well sites. We help customers monitor and modify fracturing fluids and designs, through our fluid research and development operations that we conduct through a strategic partnership with a third-party technology center that utilizes key employees who were previously affiliated with our Company. In June 2017, we renewed our services agreement with this third-party technology center for a one-year term, with an option for us to renew for additional one-year terms. This partnership allows us to work closely with our customers to rapidly adopt and integrate next-generation fluid breakthroughs, such as our NuFlo® 1000 fracturing fluid diverter, into our product offerings.
 
We own a 45% interest in SinoFTS, which is a Chinese joint venture that we formed in June 2014 with Sinopec. SinoFTS fractured its first wells in China in 2016. Although we do not expect rapid short-term growth, this joint venture provides us with experience in overseas operations that could be beneficial to us if hydraulic fracturing activity begins to grow significantly in international markets.

Our Services
 
Hydraulic Fracturing
 
Our primary service offering is providing hydraulic fracturing services, also known as pressure pumping, to oil and natural gas E&P companies. These services are designed to enhance hydrocarbon flow in oil and natural gas wells, thus increasing the amount of hydrocarbons recovered. The development of resources in unconventional reservoirs, including oil and natural gas shales, is a technically and operationally challenging segment of the oilfield services market that has experienced strong growth worldwide, particularly in the United States.
 
Oil and natural gas wells are typically divided into one or more stages, which are isolated zones that focus the high-pressure fluid and proppant from the hydraulic fracturing fleet into distinct portions of the well and surrounding reservoir. The number of stages that will divide a well is determined by the customers proposed job design, and our customers typically compensate us based on each stage completed. Although the number and length of stages may vary by basin and formation characteristics, we have historically maintained a relatively consistent presence in each operating basin. During the last two years, as a result of our customers trending toward more intense completions, our quarterly average stage length, measured in minutes to complete, has increased by approximately 16%. Despite the longer average stage lengths, we have been able to increase our average stages per active fleet compared to the end of 2014. We were able to increase our average stage per active fleets because the primary contributor to the number of stages we complete in a quarter is our ability to reduce downtime on our equipment, rather than any variability in operating basins or formation characteristics. Therefore, we believe the number of stages that each of our active fleets completes in a given period of time is an important operating metric.
 
Hydraulic fracturing represents the largest cost of completing a shale oil or natural gas well. The process consists of pumping a fracturing fluid into a well casing or tubing at sufficient pressure to fracture the formation. The fracturing fluid primarily consists of water mixed with a small amount of chemicals and guar, forming a highly viscous liquid. Materials known as proppants, in our case primarily sand, are suspended in the fracturing fluid and are pumped into the fracture to prop it open. Once the fractures are open, the fluid is designed to break, or reduce its viscosity, so that it will more easily flow back out of the formation. The proppants, which remain behind in the formation, act as a wedge that keeps the fractures open, allowing the trapped hydrocarbons to flow more freely. As a result of a successful fracturing process, hydrocarbon recovery rates are substantially enhanced; thus, increasing the return on investment for our customer. The amount of hydrocarbons produced from a typical shale oil or natural gas well generally declines quickly, with production from a shale well typically falling 60% to 70% in the first year. As a result, E&P companies must fracture new wells to maintain production levels.
 
We designed all of the hydraulic fracturing units and much of the auxiliary equipment used in our fleets to uniform specifications intended specifically for work in oil and natural gas basins requiring high pressures and high levels of sand intensity. Each of our fleets typically consists of 16 to 25 hydraulic fracturing units; two or more blenders (one used as a backup), which blend the proppant and chemicals into the hydraulic fluid; sand kings and other types of large containers used to store sand on location; various vehicles used to transport chemicals, gels and other materials; and various service trucks. Each hydraulic fracturing fleet includes a mobile, on-site control center that monitors pressures, rates and volumes, as applicable. Each control center is equipped with high bandwidth satellite hardware that provides continuous upload and download of job telemetry data. The data is delivered on a real-time basis to on-site job personnel, the customer and an assigned coordinator at our headquarters for display in both digital and graphical form.
 
Our hydraulic fracturing units consist primarily of a high-pressure pump, a diesel or combined diesel and natural gas engine, a transmission and various other supporting equipment mounted on a trailer. The high pressure pump consists of two key assemblies: the fluid-end and the power-end. Although the power-end of our pumps generally lasts several years, the fluid-end, which is the part of the pump through which the fracturing fluid is expelled under high pressure, is a shorter-lasting consumable, typically lasting less than one year. We refer to the group of hydraulic fracturing units, auxiliary equipment and vehicles necessary to perform a typical fracturing job as a fleet and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a crew. Our fleets operate primarily on a 24-hour-per-day basis, in which we typically staff three crews per fleet, including one crew with the day off. Our focus on 24-hour operations allows us to keep our equipment working for more hours per day, which we believe enhances our return-on-assets over time.
 
We primarily enter into service agreements with our customers for one or more dedicated fleets, rather than providing our fleets primarily for spot work. Under our typical dedicated fleet agreement, we deploy one or more of our hydraulic fracturing fleets exclusively to the customer to follow the customers completion schedule and job specifications until the agreement expires or is terminated in accordance with its terms. By contrast, under a typical spot work agreement, the fleet moves between customers as work becomes available. We believe that our strategy of pursuing dedicated fleet agreements leads to higher fleet utilization, as measured by the number of days each fleet is working per month, which we believe reduces our month-to-month revenue volatility and improves our revenue and profitability.

An important element of hydraulic fracturing is the proper handling of the fracturing fluid. In all of our hydraulic fracturing jobs, our customers specify the composition of the fracturing fluid to be used. Sometimes this fluid includes products marketed by us. Our customers are responsible for the disposal of the fracturing fluid that flows back out of the well, and we are not involved in that process or in the disposal of the fluid. Our contracts generally require our customers to indemnify us against pollution and environmental damages originating below the surface of the ground or arising out of water disposal, or otherwise caused by the customer, other contractors or other third parties. In turn, we indemnify our customers for pollution and environmental damages originating at or above the surface caused solely by us.
 
Wireline Services
 
Our wireline services primarily consist of setting plugs between hydraulic fracturing stages, creating perforations within hydraulic fracturing stages and logging the characteristics of resource formations. Our wireline services equipment is designed to operate under high pressure in unconventional resource formations without delaying hydraulic fracturing operations. We currently provide wireline services in each of the areas where our hydraulic fracturing fleets operate. As of December 31, 2017, we owned 51 wireline units.
Industry Overview and Trends
 
The oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by E&P companies to their well completions budget. The oil and natural gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of customer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity and other conditions and factors that are beyond our control.
 
The principal factor influencing demand for hydraulic fracturing services is the level of horizontal drilling activity by E&P companies. Since 2006, these companies have increasingly focused on exploiting the hydrocarbon reserves contained in North Americas unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs by utilizing horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Over the last decade, advances in these technologies have made the development of many unconventional resources, such as oil and natural gas shale formations, economically attractive. These advancements led to a dramatic increase in the development of oil- and natural gas-producing basins in the United States and a corresponding increase in the demand for hydraulic fracturing services. Our industry grew rapidly until a significant decline in oil and natural gas prices from 2014 to 2016 caused a dramatic reduction in drilling and completion activity.
 
The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices that began in the third quarter of 2014 continued into February 2016, when the closing price of oil reached a 12-year low of $26.14 in February 2016. The horizontal rig count in the United States declined by 77%, from its peak of 1,372 rigs in November 2014 to a low of 314 rigs in May 2016, according to a Baker Hughes, Inc. report dated January 6, 2017. The reduced drilling activity led to a reduction in demand for hydraulic fracturing services and resulted in increased competition and lower prices for hydraulic fracturing services. The low commodity price environment caused a reduction in the completion activities of most of our customers and their spending on our services, which substantially reduced the prices we could charge our customers and had a negative impact on our activity levels during this period. We believe the financial distress of many other providers of hydraulic fracturing services led to significant maintenance deferrals and the use of idle fleets for spare parts, resulting in a material reduction in total deployable fracturing fleets.
 
Recently, oil prices have increased since the 12-year low recorded in February 2016, reaching a high of $64.89 in December 2017 and averaging $50.80 in 2017. As commodity prices have rebounded, we have experienced an increase in the level of demand for our services. Although our industry traditionally has been volatile, the following trends in our industry should benefit our operations and our ability to achieve our business objectives as commodity prices recover:
 
Large production growth from U.S. oil and natural gas formations. The average oil field production in the United States grew at a compound annual growth rate of 8.4% over the period from 2010 through 2016 due to production gains from unconventional reservoirs. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, U.S. tight oil production grew from approximately 430,000 barrels per day in 2007 to over 4.6 million barrels per day in 2017 through November, representing 70% of total U.S. crude oil production in 2017 (as of the end of November). A majority of this increase came from the Permian Basin, the SCOOP/STACK Formation, the Marcellus/Utica Shale, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Haynesville Shale, which are our five operating basins, as well as
 
4




the Williston Basin. We expect that this continued growth will result in increased demand for our services as commodity prices continue to stabilize or increase.
 
Increased use of horizontal drilling to develop high-pressure U.S. resource basins. The horizontal rig count as a percentage of the overall onshore rig count has increased every year since 2007, when horizontal rigs represented only approximately 25% of the total U.S. onshore rig count to approximately 86% at the end of 2017. We believe horizontal drilling activity will continue to grow as a portion of overall onshore wells drilled in the United States, primarily due to E&P companies increasingly developing unconventional resources such as shales. Successful economic production of these unconventional resource basins frequently requires hydraulic fracturing services like those we provide.
 
Faster drilling speed. The speed of drilling rigs is increasing significantly, which has increased the number of wells drilled for a given rig count. The speed of drilling means that more fracturing fleets are needed for every active drilling rig. On average there used to be four drilling rigs for each fracturing fleet, but that ratio is now less than 3-to-1, and continuing to decline. As a result, E&P companies are able to complete more stages using fewer rigs, and industry sources expect that total stages completed in 2017 will surpass 2014 levels at a significantly lower corresponding rig count.
 
Increasing completions intensity. Longer lateral lengths for horizontal wells and more sand per lateral foot require increased horsepower to execute a completion, which means that more fracturing units will be required for each fleet. The increased amount of sand per lateral foot also increases the wear-and-tear on each units components and parts, which increases the repair and maintenance costs for each fleet. We expect that the projected increase in drilling speed and sand intensity will result in an increased demand for, and diminished supply of, pressure pumping services.
 
Reduced supply of hydraulic fracturing services from our competitors. The hydraulic fracturing industry in the United States is characterized by a few large providers (six with over 1 million horsepower), several medium sized providers (nine with between 1 million and 300,000 horsepower) and a significant number of smaller providers. We believe that many of these providers have been deferring or declining to repair their hydraulic fracturing equipment as it breaks down from ordinary use. This phenomenon of providers choosing to retire rather than repair broken equipment is often referred to as attrition. According to an industry report, the total working horsepower in North America declined from approximately 15 million in 2014 to approximately 6 million in 2016. Additionally, the large number of small service providers in our industry may make it an attractive candidate for industry consolidation, which would further reduce competition. These factors should lead to a better balance of supply and demand and to higher pricing levels for our services.
 
Completion of refracturings and drilled-but-uncompleted wells. As producing shale wells age, their level of production declines, typically falling 60% to 70% in the first year. Refracturing these wells can increase production levels. As the number and age of producing unconventional wells increases, the market for recompletions is expected to increase. In addition, because the cost of recompleting a well is generally lower than the total cost of drilling and completing a new well, the demand for recompletions is expected to increase relative to demand for new completions during depressed commodity price environments.
 
Potential development of international markets for our hydraulic fracturing services. There has been growing international interest in the development of unconventional resources such as oil and natural gas shales. This interest has resulted in a number of recently completed joint ventures between major U.S. and international E&P companies related to shale basins in the United States and acquisitions of significant acreage in shale basins in the United States by large, non-U.S. E&P companies. We believe that these acquisitions and joint ventures, which generally require the international partner to commit to significant future capital expenditures, will provide additional demand for hydraulic fracturing services in the coming years. Additionally, such activity may stimulate development of oil and natural gas shales outside the United States, such as the recent activity by our SinoFTS joint venture in Chongqing, China.
 
Increase in demand for oil and natural gas. The EIA projects that the average WTI price will increase through 2040 from growing demand and the development of more costly oil resources. The EIA also anticipates continued growth in long-term U.S. domestic demand for natural gas. We believe that as demand for oil and natural gas increases, E&P activity will rise and demand for our services will increase. Recent events including declines in North American production, attrition in the supply of horsepower in our industry and agreements by OPEC and certain other oil-producing countries to reduce oil production have provided upward momentum for energy prices. If near-term commodity prices stabilize at current levels or recover further, we expect a more active demand environment during 2018 and 2019 than was experienced in 2015 and 2016.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that we are well positioned because of the following competitive strengths:
 
5




Large scale and leading market share across five of the most active major U.S. unconventional resource basins
 
With 1.6 million total hydraulic horsepower in our fleet, we are one of the largest hydraulic fracturing service providers in North America. We operate in five of the most active major unconventional basins in the United States, including the Permian Basin, the SCOOP/STACK Formation, the Marcellus/Utica Shale, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Haynesville Shale, which provide us exposure to a variety of oil and natural gas producers as well as geographies. We are one of the top three hydraulic fracturing providers across this operating footprint based on market share. According to an industry report from December 2017, these five operating basins will account for approximately 80% of well-completions spending in 2018 and 2019.
 
This geographic diversity reduces the volatility in our revenue due to basin trends, relative oil and natural gas prices, adverse weather and other events. Our five hydraulic fracturing districts enable us to rapidly reposition our fleets based on demand trends among different basins. Additionally, our large market share in each of our operating basins allows us to spread our fixed costs over a greater number of fleets. Furthermore, our large scale strengthens our negotiating position with our suppliers and our customers.
 
Pure-play, efficient hydraulic fracturing services provider with extensive experience in U.S. unconventional oil and natural gas production
 
Our primary focus is hydraulic fracturing. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, 95% of our revenues came from hydraulic fracturing services. From December 31, 2010 to January 8, 2018, we have completed more than 163,000 fracturing stages across five of the most active major unconventional basins in the United States. This history gives us invaluable experience and operational capabilities that are at the leading edge of horizontal well completions in unconventional formations.
 
We designed and assembled all of the hydraulic fracturing units and much of the auxiliary equipment used in our fleets to uniform specifications intended specifically for work in oil and natural gas basins requiring high pressures and high levels of sand intensity. In addition, we use proprietary pumps with fluid-ends that are capable of meeting the most demanding pressure, flow rate and proppant loading requirements encountered in the field.
 
In order to achieve the highest revenue potential and highest returns on our invested capital, we run all of our fleets in 24-hour operations allowing us to optimize the revenue-producing ability of our active fleets. In addition, rather than perform spot work, we prefer to dedicate each of our fleets to a specific customer, integrating our fleet into their drilling program schedule. These arrangements allow us to increase the number of days per month that our fleet is generating revenue and allow our crews to better understand customer expectations resulting in improved efficiency and safety.
 
In-house manufacturing, equipment maintenance and refurbishment capabilities
 
We manufacture and refurbish many of the components used by our fleets, including consumables, such as fluid-ends. We also perform substantially all the maintenance, repair and refurbishment of our hydraulic fracturing fleets, including the reactivation of our idle equipment. Our cost to produce components and reactivate idle fleets is significantly less than the cost to purchase comparable quality components and fleets from third-party suppliers. For example, we manufacture fluid-ends and power-ends at a cost that is approximately 50% to 60% less than purchasing them from outside suppliers. In addition, we perform full-scale refurbishments of our fracturing units at a cost that is approximately half the cost of utilizing an outside supplier. We estimate that this cost advantage saves us approximately $85 million per year at peak production levels. As trends in our industry continue toward increasing proppant levels and service intensity, the added wear-and-tear on hydraulic fracturing equipment will increase the rate at which components need to be replaced for a typical fleet, increasing our long-term cost advantage versus our competitors that do not have similar in-house manufacturing capabilities.
 
Our manufacturing capabilities also reduce the risk that we will be unable to source important components, such as fluid-ends, power-ends and other consumable parts. During periods of high demand for hydraulic fracturing services, external equipment vendors often report order backlogs of up to nine months. Our competitors may be unable to source components when needed or may be required to pay a much higher price for their components, or both, due to bottlenecks in supplier production levels. We have historically manufactured, and believe we have the capacity to manufacture, all major consumable components required to operate all 32 of our fleets at full capacity. We also designed and assembled all of our 32 existing fleets using internal resources and believe we can assemble new fleets internally at a substantial discount to the cost of buying them new from third-party providers.
 
Additionally, manufacturing our equipment internally allows us to constantly improve our equipment design in response to the knowledge we gain by operating in harsh geological environments under challenging conditions. This rapid feedback loop between our field operations and our manufacturing operations positions our equipment at the leading edge of developments in hydraulic fracturing design.

Uniform fleet of standardized, high specification hydraulic fracturing equipment
 
We have a uniform fleet of hydraulic fracturing equipment. We designed our equipment to uniform specifications intended specifically for completions work in oil and natural gas basins requiring high levels of pressure, flow rate and sand intensity. The standardized, plug and play nature of our fleet provides us with several advantages, including: reduced repair and maintenance costs; reduced inventory costs; the ability to redeploy equipment among operating basins; and reduced complexity in our operations, which improves our safety and operational performance. We believe our technologically advanced fleets are among the most reliable and best performing in the industry with the capabilities to meet the most demanding pressure and flow rate requirements in the field.
 
Our standardized equipment reduces our downtime as our mechanics can quickly and efficiently diagnose and repair our equipment. Our uniform equipment also reduces the amount of inventory we need on hand. We are able to more easily shift fracturing pumps and other equipment among operating areas as needed to take advantage of market conditions and to replace temporarily damaged equipment. This flexibility allows us to target customers that are offering higher prices for our services, regardless of the basins in which they operate. Standardized equipment also reduces the complexity of our operations, which lowers our training costs. Additionally, we believe our industry-leading safety record is partly attributable to the standardization of our equipment, which makes it easier for mechanics and equipment operators to identify and diagnose problems with equipment before they become safety hazards.
 
Safety leader
 
Safety is at the core of our operations. Our safety record for 2016 was the best in our history and we believe significantly better than our industry peer group, based on data provided by reports of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2011 through 2016. For the past three years, we believe our total recordable incident rate was less than half of the industry average. During the first quarter of 2017, we reached a milestone of over 10 million man-hours without a lost time incident. Many of our customers impose minimum safety requirements on their suppliers of hydraulic fracturing services, and some of our competitors are not permitted to bid on work for certain customers because they do not meet those customers minimum safety requirements. Because safety is important to our customers, our safety score helps our commercial team to win business from our customers. Our safety focus is also a morale benefit for our crews, which enhances our employee retention rates. Finally, we believe that continually searching for ways to make our operations safer is the right thing to do for our employees and our customers.
 
Experienced management and operating team
 
During the downturn, our management team focused on reducing costs, increasing operating efficiency and differentiating ourselves through innovation. The team has an extensive and diverse skill set, with an average of over 23 years of professional experience. Our operational and commercial executives have a deep understanding of unconventional resource formations, with an average of approximately 31 years of oil and natural gas industry experience. In addition, as a result of our pure-play focus on hydraulic fracturing and dedicated fleet strategy, our operations teams have extensive knowledge of the geographies in which we operate as well as the technical specifications and other requirements of our customers. We believe this knowledge and experience allows us to service a variety of E&P companies across different basins efficiently and safely.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our primary business objective is to be the largest pure-play provider of hydraulic fracturing services within U.S. unconventional resource basins. We intend to achieve this objective through the following strategies:
 
Capitalize on expected recovery and demand for our services
 
As demand for oilfield services in the United States recovers, the hydraulic fracturing sector is expected to grow significantly. We believe that the cost per barrel of oil from unconventional onshore production is one of the lowest in the United States, and, as a result, E&P capital has shifted towards this type of production. Industry reports have forecasted that the number of horizontal wells drilled in the United States will increase at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 20.7% from 2016 through 2020. In addition, the sand utilized in the completion of a horizontal well has more than doubled since 2014 as operators continue to innovate to find the optimal job design. As one of the largest hydraulic fracturing service providers in North America, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the continued increase in the onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production market.
 
We have 1.6 million total hydraulic horsepower across 32 total fleets, with 27 fleets active as of December 31, 2017. A surge in demand for our services led us to reactivate 10 fleets since the beginning of 2017. We are in the process of activating additional fleets based on continued customer interest, and we believe all of this equipment can be returned to service within nine months, if market conditions require. We estimate the average cost to reactivate our inactive fleets to be approximately $6.9 million per fleet, which includes capital expenditures, repairs charged as operating expenses, labor costs and other operating expenses.

Deepen and expand relationships with customers that value our completions efficiency
 
We service our customers primarily with dedicated fleets and 24-hour operations. We dedicate one or more of our fleets exclusively to the customer for a period of time, allowing for those fleets to be integrated into the customers drilling and completion schedule. As a result, we are able to achieve higher levels of utilization, as measured by the number of days each fleet is working per month, which increases our profitability. In addition, we operate our fleets on a 24-hour basis, allowing us to complete our services more efficiently with the least amount of downtime. Accordingly, we seek to partner with customers that have a large number of wells needing completion and that value efficiency in the performance of our service. Specifically, we target customers whose completions activity typically involves minimal downtime between stages, a high number of stages per well, multiple wells per pad and a short distance from one well pad site to the next. This strategy aligns with the strategy of many of our customers, who are trying to achieve a manufacturing-style model of drilling and completing wells in a sequential pattern to maximize effective acreage. We plan to leverage this strategy to expand our relationships with our existing customers as we continue to attract new customers.
 
Capitalize on our uniform fleet, leading scale and significant basin diversity to provide superior performance with reduced operating costs
 
We primarily serve large independent E&P companies that specialize in unconventional oil and natural gas resources in North America. Because we operate for customers with significant scale in each of our operating basins, we have the diversity to react to and benefit from positive activity trends in any basin with a balanced exposure to oil and natural gas. Our uniform fleet allows us to cost-effectively redeploy equipment and fleets among existing operating basins to capture the best pricing and activity trends. The uniform fleet is easier to operate and maintain, resulting in reduced downtime as well as lower training costs and inventory stocking requirements. Our geographic breadth also provides us with opportunities to capitalize on customer relationships in one basin in order to win business in other basins in which the customer operates. We intend to leverage our scale, standardized equipment and cost structure to gain market share and win new business.
 
Rapidly adopt new technologies in a capital efficient manner
 
Our large scale and culture of innovation allow us to take advantage of leading technological solutions. We have been a fast adopter of new technologies focused on: increasing fracturing effectiveness for our customers, reducing the operating costs of our equipment and enhancing the HSE conditions at our well sites. We help customers monitor and modify fracturing fluids and designs through our fluid research and development operations that we conduct through a strategic partnership with a third-party technology center that utilizes key employees who were previously affiliated with our Company. In June 2017, we renewed our services agreement with this third-party technology center for a one-year term, with an option for us to renew for additional one-year terms. This partnership allows us to work closely with our customers to rapidly adopt and integrate next-generation fluid breakthroughs, such as our NuFlo® 1000 fracturing fluid diverter, into our product offerings.
 
Recent examples of initiatives aimed at reducing our operating costs include: vibration sensors with predictive maintenance analytics on our heavy equipment; stainless steel fluid-ends with a longer useful life; high-definition cameras to remotely monitor the performance of our equipment; and adoption of hardened alloys and lubricant blends for our consumables. Recent examples of initiatives aimed at improving our HSE conditions include: dual fuel engines that can run on both natural gas and diesel fuel; electronic pressure relief systems; spill prevention and containment solutions; dust control mitigation; electronic logging devices; and leading containerized proppant delivery solutions.
 
Reduce debt and maintain a more conservative capital structure
 
To improve our financial flexibility, we entered into a $250.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility on February 22, 2018. Our focus will be on the continued prudent management of our capital structure. We believe this focus creates potential for significant operating leverage and strong free cash flow generation during an industry upcycle. As a result, we believe we should be able to not only make the investments necessary to remain a market leader in hydraulic fracturing, but also to continue to strengthen our balance sheet. If we are able to sufficiently reduce our indebtedness and continue to generate cash flow from operations, we expect to return value to shareholders, including by means of cash returns, accretive acquisitions that fit our model and footprint, or the construction of new fleets depending on our business outlook. See Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  Dividends in Item 5 of this annual report and Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness in Item 1A of this annual report for more information.

Suppliers
 
We purchase some of the parts that we use in the refurbishment and repair of our heavy equipment, such as hydraulic fracturing units and blenders, and in the refurbishment, repair and manufacturing of certain major replacement components of our heavy equipment such as fluid-ends, power-ends, engines, transmissions, radiators and trailers. We also purchase the proppants and chemicals we use in our operations and the diesel fuel for our equipment from a variety of suppliers throughout the United States. We have long-term supply agreements with four vendors to supply a significant portion of the proppant used in our operations, ranging from two to eight years. These are take-or-pay agreements with minimum unconditional purchase obligations. These minimum purchase obligations would change based upon the vendors ability to supply the minimum requirements. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis at competitive prices. In the past, we have experienced some delays in obtaining these materials during periods of high demand. We do not currently expect significant interruptions in the supply of these materials. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, there can be no assurance that there will be no price or supply issues over the long-term.
Competition
 
The market in which we operate is highly competitive and highly fragmented. Our competition includes multi-national oilfield service companies as well as regional competitors. Our major multi-national competitors are Halliburton Company and Schlumberger Limited, each of which has significantly greater financial resources than we do. Our major domestic competitors are RPC, Inc., Superior Energy Services, ProPetro Holding Corp., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., BJ Services, Inc., Liberty Oilfield Services Inc. and Keane Group, Inc. Certain of these competitors are large, multi-national and major domestic businesses that provide a number of oilfield services and products in addition to hydraulic fracturing. We also face competition from smaller regional service providers in some of the geographies in which we operate.
 
Competition in our industry is based on a number of factors, including price, service quality, safety, and in some cases, breadth of products. We believe we consistently deliver exceptional service quality, based in part on the durability of our equipment. Our durable equipment reduces downtime due to equipment failure and allows our customers to avoid costs associated with delays in completing their wells. By being able to meet the most demanding pressure and flow rate requirements, our equipment also enables us to operate efficiently in challenging geological environments in which some of our competitors cannot operate effectively.
 
Cyclical Nature of Industry
 
We operate in a highly cyclical industry driven mainly by the level of horizontal drilling activity by E&P companies in unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs in North America, which in turn depends largely on current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas prices and production depletion rates. A critical factor in assessing the outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas. Demand for oil and natural gas is subject to large and rapid fluctuations. These fluctuations are driven by commodity demand in the industry and corresponding price increases. When oil and natural gas prices increase, producers generally increase their capital expenditures, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies. However, increased capital expenditures also ultimately result in greater production, which historically, has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices that, in turn, tend to reduce demand for oilfield services such as
 
9




hydraulic fracturing services. For these reasons, our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and these fluctuations may distort period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations.
 
Seasonality
 
Seasonality has not significantly affected our overall operations. However, toward the end of some years, we experience slower activity in our pressure pumping operations in connection with the holidays and as customers capital expenditure budgets are depleted. Occasionally, our operations have been negatively impacted by severe weather conditions.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 2,400 employees. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, nor are they members of labor unions. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Insurance
 
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires, oil spills and hazardous materials spills. These conditions can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment, the environment and wildlife and interruption or suspension of operations, among other adverse effects. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in our being named as a defendant to a lawsuit asserting significant claims.
 
Despite our high safety standards, we from time to time have suffered accidents in the past and we anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property and personal losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability, as well as our relationships with customers, employees and regulatory agencies. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers compensation and other forms of insurance and could have other adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
We carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations, and we are partially self-insured for certain claims, in types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for our industry. These coverages and retentions address certain risks relating to commercial general liability, workers compensation, business auto, property and equipment, directors and officers, environment, pollution and other risks. Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in our industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA), issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. Strict adherence with these regulatory requirements increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. However, environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities. Certain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report, entitled Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States, on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The report states that the EPA found scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The report does not make any policy
 
10




recommendations. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.
 
At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in May 2013, the Railroad Commission of Texas issued a well integrity rule, which updates the requirements for drilling, putting pipe down and cementing wells. The rule also includes new testing and reporting requirements, such as (i) the requirement to submit cementing reports after well completion or after cessation of drilling, whichever is later, and (ii) the imposition of additional testing on wells less than 1,000 feet below usable groundwater. The well integrity rule took effect in January 2014. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Some states, counties and municipalities are closely examining water-use issues, such as permit and disposal options for processed water. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of development activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. See Risk FactorsFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in Item 1A of this annual report.
 
Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws generally impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous or other state-regulated substances into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed responsible parties are subject to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment.
 
Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations issued thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a final report which identified discharge of inadequately treated hydraulic fracturing wastewater to surface water resources as having potential to impact drinking water resources. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff, which require covered facilities to obtain permits.
 
These laws and regulations also prohibit certain other activity in wetlands unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which we refer to as the Corps. In September 2015, a new rule became effective which was issued by the EPA and the Corps defining the scope of the jurisdiction of the EPA and the Corps over wetlands and other waters. The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of Clean Water Acts programs, and implementation of the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge. In November 2017, the EPA and the Corps published a new proposed rule defining the scope of jurisdiction and adding an applicability date of two years after the date of a final rule under the proposed rulemaking effort. Also, spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters. Noncompliance with these requirements may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations.
 
Waste Handling. Wastes from certain of our operations (such as equipment maintenance and past chemical development, blending, and distribution operations) are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although certain oil production wastes are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may constitute solid wastes that are subject to the less stringent requirements of non-hazardous waste provisions. In the EPAs 2016 final report on the impacts from hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, the EPA identified disposal or storage of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in unlined pits as resulting in contamination of groundwater resources.
 
11




Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Moreover, the EPA or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous wastes. Several environmental organizations have also petitioned the EPA to modify existing regulations to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses.
 
From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own, owned previously or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, the federal Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws. Under these laws or other laws and regulations, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate these materials or wastes and make expenditures associated with personal injury or property damage. At this time, with respect to any properties where materials or wastes may have been released, but of which we have not been made aware, it is not possible to estimate the potential costs that may arise from unknown, latent liability risks.
 
Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from specified sources. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. We are required to obtain federal and state permits in connection with some activities under applicable laws. These permits impose certain conditions and restrictions on our operations, some of which require significant expenditures for compliance. Changes in these requirements, or in the permits we operate under, could increase our costs or limit operations.
 
Additionally, the EPAs Tier IV regulations apply to certain off-road diesel engines used by us to power equipment in the field. Under these regulations, we are required to retrofit or retire certain engines and we are limited in the number of non-compliant off-road diesel engines we can purchase. Tier IV engines are costlier and not widely available. Until Tier IV-compliant engines that meet our needs are more widely available, these regulations could limit our ability to acquire a sufficient number of diesel engines to expand our fleet and to replace existing engines as they are taken out of service.
 
Other Environmental Considerations. E&P activities on federal lands may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, which we refer to as NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. E&P activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
 
Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Clean Water Act and CERCLA. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to jurisdictional streams or wetlands habitat or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent oil and natural gas exploration activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat, or natural resources resulting from filling of jurisdictional streams or wetlands or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials.
 
BLM has established regulations to govern hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The 2015 Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands Rule (the Federal and Indian Lands Rule) imposes drilling and construction requirements for operations on federal or Indian lands including management requirements for surface operations and public disclosures of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing fluids. In June 2016, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming ruled that the BLM lacked statutory authority to promulgate the Federal and Indian Lands Rule. On July 25, 2017, BLM published a Notice in the Federal Register proposing to rescind the Federal and Indian Lands Rule. On September 21, 2017, the Tenth Circuit dismissed as moot the appeal challenging the rule and vacated the June 2016 U.S. District Court of Wyoming decision that invalidated the Federal and Indian Lands Rule. On December 29, 2017, BLM published a rescission of these regulations. BLM also promulgated the 2016 Methane and Waste Reduction Rule to reduce waste of natural gas supplies and reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, for oil and natural gas produced on federal and Indian lands. Various states have filed for a petition for review of the Methane and Waste Reduction Rule. On December 8, 2017, BLM published a final rule delay until January 2019 for certain requirements of the rule that had not yet gone into effect pending judicial review of the rule. A coalition of environmental groups has filed suit challenging the delay. Imposition of these rules could increase our costs or limit operations.

The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), requires manufacturers of new chemical substances to provide specific information to the Agency for review prior to manufacturing chemicals or introducing them into commerce. EPA has permitted manufacture of new chemical nanoscale materials through the use of consent orders or Significant New Use Rules under TSCA. The Agency has also allowed the manufacture of new chemical nanoscale materials under the terms of certain regulatory exemptions where exposures were controlled to protect against unreasonable risks. On May 19, 2014, the EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to obtain data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. The EPA projects publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking in June of 2018. Any changes in TSCA regulations could increase our capital expenditures and operating expenses.
 
Climate Change. In December 2009, the EPA issued an Endangerment Finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA, emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earths atmosphere and other climatic changes. The EPA later adopted two sets of related rules, one of which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions from certain large stationary sources of emissions. The motor vehicle rule, which became effective in July 2010, limits emissions from motor vehicles. The EPA adopted the stationary source rule, which we refer to as the tailoring rule, in May 2010, and it became effective January 2011. The tailoring rule established new emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD), and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Court ruled that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for greenhouse gas emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On December 19, 2014, the EPA issued two memoranda providing guidance on greenhouse gas permitting requirements in response to the Supreme Courts decision. In its preliminary guidance, the EPA stated that it would undertake a rulemaking action to rescind any PSD permits issued under the portions of the tailoring rule that were vacated by the Court. In the interim, the EPA issued a narrowly crafted no action assurance indicating it will exercise its enforcement discretion not to pursue enforcement of the terms and conditions relating to greenhouse gases in an EPA-issued PSD permit, and for related terms and conditions in a Title V permit. On April 30, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule allowing permitting authorities to rescind PSD permits issued under the invalid regulations. In October 2015, the EPA amended the greenhouse gas reporting rule to add the reporting of emissions from oil wells using hydraulic fracturing. Because of this continued regulatory focus, future emission regulations of the oil and natural gas industry remain a possibility, which could increase the cost of our operations.
 
In addition, the U.S. Congress occasionally attempts to adopt legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and almost one-half of the states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories or regional cap and trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not yet adopted such legislation, it may do so in the future. Several states continue to pursue related regulations as well. In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake ambitious efforts to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Paris Agreement, which came into force on November 4, 2016, establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Although the Trump Administration has withdrawn the United States from the Paris Agreement, many state and local officials have publicly stated they intend to abide by the terms of the Paris Agreement. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry which could have a material adverse effect on future demand for our services. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our customers business and consequently our own.
 
In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations and could allege personal injury or property damages, which could increase our operating costs.
 
NORM. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials associated with oil and natural gas deposits and, accordingly may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM). NORM exhibiting levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. Because certain of the properties presently or previously owned, operated or occupied by us may have been used for oil and natural gas production operations, it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with NORM.
Pollution Risk Management. We seek to minimize the possibility of a pollution event through equipment and job design, as well as through employee training. We also maintain a pollution risk management program if a pollution event occurs. This program
 
13




includes an internal emergency response plan that provides specific procedures for our employees to follow in the event of a chemical release or spill. In addition, we have contracted with several third-party emergency responders in our various operating areas that are available on a 24-hour basis to handle the remediation and clean-up of any chemical release or spill. We carry insurance designed to respond to foreseeable environmental exposures. This insurance portfolio has been structured in an effort to address incidents that result in bodily injury or property damage and any ensuing clean up needed at our owned facilities as a result of the mobilization and utilization of our fleet, as well as any claims resulting from our operations.
 
We also seek to manage environmental liability risks through provisions in our contracts with our customers that allocate risks relating to surface activities associated with the fracturing process, other than water disposal, to us and risks relating to downhole liabilities to our customers. Our customers are responsible for the disposal of the fracturing fluid that flows back out of the well as waste water. The customers remove the water from the well using a controlled flow-back process, and we are not involved in that process or the disposal of the fluid. Our contracts generally require our customers to indemnify us against pollution and environmental damages originating below the surface of the ground or arising out of water disposal, or otherwise caused by the customer, other contractors or other third parties. In turn, we indemnify our customers for pollution and environmental damages originating at or above the surface caused solely by us. We seek to maintain consistent risk-allocation and indemnification provisions in our customer agreements to the greatest extent possible. Some of our contracts, however, contain less explicit indemnification provisions, which typically provide that each party will indemnify the other against liabilities to third parties resulting from the indemnifying partys actions, except to the extent such liability results from the indemnified partys gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional act.
 
Safety and Health Regulation
 
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, which is administered and enforced by OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. OSHA continues to evaluate worker safety and to propose new regulations, such as but not limited to, the new rule regarding respirable silica sand. Although it is not possible to estimate the financial and compliance impact of the new respirable silica sand rule or any other proposed rule, the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Intellectual Property Rights
 
Our research and development efforts are focused on providing specific solutions to the challenges our customers face when fracturing and stimulating wells. In addition to the design and manufacture of innovative equipment, we have also developed proprietary blends of chemicals that we use in connection with our hydraulic fracturing services. We have four U.S. patents, one patent in Canada and one patent in Mexico, and have filed one patent application in the U.S., relating to fracturing methods, the technology used in fluid ends, hydraulic pumps and other equipment. We have also filed two applications with the Patent Cooperation Treaty, thereby preserving our right to seek patent protection in countries that are a party to the treaty.
 
We believe the information regarding our customer and supplier relationships are also valuable proprietary assets. We have registered trademarks for various names under which our entities conduct business. Except for the foregoing, we do not own or license any patents, trademarks or other intellectual property that we believe to be material to the success of our business.
