  Overview
  
  FluoroPharma Medical, Inc. ("we", the "Company" or the "Registrant") is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in discovering, developing and commercializing molecular imaging pharmaceuticals with initial applications in the area of cardiology. Molecular imaging pharmaceuticals are radiopharmaceuticals that enable early detection and/or assessment of disease through the visualization of subtle changes in biochemical and biological processes.  Our initial focus has been on the development of novel cardiovascular imaging agents that can more efficiently and effectively detect and assess acute and chronic forms of coronary artery disease, or CAD.  We currently have two clinical-stage molecular imaging pharmaceutical product candidates: 18-F TPP (BFPET) and 18-F FCPHA (CardioPET).
 Corporate History
  
  FluoroPharma Medical, Inc. (f/k/a Commercial E-Waste Management Inc.) was organized in January 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada to serve as an electronics waste management solution provider, specializing in the collection, retirement, storage and remarketing of excess, damaged or obsolete electronic assets. FluoroPharma Inc. was organized in June 2003 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary products for the positron emission tomography (PET) market.  Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among FluoroPharma Medical, Inc., FluoroPharma, Inc., and FPI Merger Corporation., a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary of FluoroPharma Medical, Inc. (“MergerCo”), on May 16, 2011, MergerCo merged with and into FluoroPharma Inc., and FluoroPharma Inc., as the surviving corporation, became a wholly owned subsidiary of FluoroPharma Medical, Inc. (the “Merger”). Since the Merger, we have conducted our business through our wholly-owned subsidiary.

  Our Product Candidates
  
  BFPET (18-F FTPP)
  
  Our BFPET program employs a ([18F]-labeled cationic lipophilic tetraphenylphosphonium ion (18-FTPP) as an imaging agent designed for use in stress-testing for patients with presumptive or proven CAD. 18-F FTPP measures the extent and severity of cardiovascular disease through the detection of ischemic (i.e. reversible and viable) and infarcted (i.e., irreversibly damaged) myocardial (i.e., heart) tissue. Its mechanism of action allows it to enter the myocardial cells of the heart muscle in direct proportion to blood flow and membrane potential--the most important indicators of adequate cardiac blood supply. Since ischemic and infarcted myocardial cells take up significantly less 18-F FTPP than normal healthy myocardial cells do, 18-F FTPP can distinguish ischemic and infarcted cells from those that are healthy. If approved, 18-F FTPP will represent one of the first molecular imaging blood flow agents commercialized for use in the cardiovascular segment of the PET imaging market. 18-F FTPP may also provide information on cardiac mitochondrial membrane potential, enabling global and regional assessment of the electro-physiologic integrity of the myocardium.
  
  Currently, cardiac perfusion imaging is performed routinely with SPECT tracers such as Sestamibi, Tetrofosmin, Thallium-201 or the PET tracers Rubidium-82 and N-13 ammonia. However, the industry standard SPECT imaging has a diagnostic accuracy of approximately 75%, with research indicating that 10% of patients cleared as “normal” were subsequently found to be “abnormal” using PET imaging. The current PET tracer Rubidium-82 has experienced an FDA recall and high cost issues, while N-13 ammonia is produced in a cyclotron and must be used locally within a matter of minutes due to a very short physical half-life. The introduction of a Fluorine-labeled myocardial agent, with its longer half-life enabling the existing supply-chain potential, would be a catalyzing event toward advancing the role of PET imaging in cardiovascular disease and improving diagnostic imaging.
  
  18-F FTPP successfully completed a Phase I clinical trial in 12 healthy volunteers with no adverse events and no clinically significant changes noted in follow-up clinical and laboratory testing. The results of the trial demonstrated the required dosimetry, safety profile and high-resolution myocardial imaging pharmacokinetics to justify a controlled Phase II clinical trial. We have announced that we will begin Phase II trials at Massachusetts General Hospital to assess its efficacy in CAD subjects; and expect enrollment to commence in 2017.
  
  CardioPET (18-F FCPHA)
  
  Our CardioPET program employs Trans-9-[18F]-Fluoro-3, 4-Methyleneheptadecanoic Acid (18-F FCPHA) as a molecular imaging agent designed to assess myocardial blood flow and metabolism in patients with CAD, including  patients  unable to perform exercise cardiac stress-testing. 18-F FCPHA allows for the potential detection of ischemic (i.e. reversible and viable) and infarcted (i.e. irreversibly damaged) myocardial tissue in patients with presumptive or proven acute and chronic CAD and related cardiac diseases.
  
  In addition, 18-F FCPHA could be useful for assessing myocardial viability for the prediction of improvement prior to and/or following revascularization in patients with acute CAD, including myocardial infarction (heart attack). 18-F FCPHA allows for the identification of compromised but viable heart tissue, which is important since revascularization in those patients with substantial viable myocardium results in improved left ventricular function and survival. Importantly, 18-F FCPHA, if approved, may have several significant advantages for assessing cardiac viability using PET, and would likely represent the first imaging agent available in the U.S. for use in patients with chronic CAD and underlying metabolic disorders. 18-F FCPHA is designed to provide the fatty-acid metabolic component for assessing myocardial metabolism and viability, which play a central role in the progression of diabetes and heart failure.
  
  The safety and tolerability of 18-F FCPHA have been demonstrated in a Phase I trial conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital.  Enrollment in a Phase IIa trial has been completed at four sites in Belgium to assess its safety and efficacy in CAD patients.  This Phase IIa study was an open label trial designed to assess the safety and diagnostic performance of 18-F FCPHA compared with standard-of-care myocardial perfusion imaging, and angiography as a gold standard of epicardial coronary artery disease. Specifically, the Phase IIa trial consisted of approximately 30 individuals with known or suspected stable chronic CAD who underwent imaging at rest and after pharmacologic and exercise stress-testing for the evaluation of suspected or proven CAD. Interim safety and imaging results were presented in February 2014. The enrollment for the Phase IIa clinical trial of CardioPET was closed in December 2014. Analysis was performed and a full clinical study report (CSR) was completed and submitted to FAMHP (Europe) in July of 2016. A briefing package will be submitted to US FDA with the annual IND update in May of 2017.

  Strategic Alliances and Commercial Agreements
  
  License Agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital
  
  We have two exclusive technology licenses with Massachusetts General Hospital (“MGH”) which we entered into on June 26, 2014 (collectively, the “Agreements”). Those agreements replace the single license agreement with MGH dated April 27, 2009, as amended by letter dated June 21, 2011 and agreement dated October 31, 2011 (the “Original Agreement”). The Agreements provide exclusive licenses for our two lead product candidates, BFPET and CardioPET, two of the three cardiac imaging technologies covered by the Original Agreement. The Agreements were entered into primarily for the purpose of separating our rights and obligations with respect to our different product development programs. Each of the Agreements requires us to pay MGH an initial license fee of $175,000 and annual license maintenance fees of $125,000 each. The Agreements require us to meet certain obligations, including, but not limited to, meeting certain development milestones relating to clinical trials and filings with the United States Food and Drug Administration. MGH has the right to cancel or make non-exclusive certain licenses on certain patents should we fail to meet stipulated obligations and milestones. Additionally, upon commercialization, we are required to make specified milestone payments and royalties on commercial sales. On August 10, 2016, we entered into agreements with MGH to amend the Agreements to include the potential to license technical information in addition to intellectual property. We are amortizing the cost of these intangible assets over the remaining useful life of the Agreements of 10 years.
  
  We believe that we maintain a good relationship with MGH and will be able to obtain waivers or extension of our obligations under the Agreements, should the need arise. If MGH were to refuse to provide us with a waiver or extension of any of our obligations or were to cancel or make the license non-exclusive, this would have a material adverse impact on our business as we may be unable to commercialize products without exclusivity and would lose our competitive edge for portions of the patent portfolio. 
  
  License Agreement with Sinotau USA
  
  We have two exclusive license agreements (the “Licenses”) with Sinotau USA, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hainan Sinotau Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Sinotau”), a pharmaceutical organization. Sinotau is responsible for developing and commercializing the Company’s proprietary cardiac PET imaging assets, CardioPET and BFPET, in China and Canada.  Sinotau also retains a first right of refusal to license the technology for development in Australia and Singapore. In accordance with the Licenses, the Company is entitled to upfront payments of $550,000, milestone payments totaling $1,450,000 upon the completion of certain development activities and royalties on future sales made by Sinotau. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has received payments of $775,000 in accordance with the terms of the Licenses.
  
  Clinical Research Agreements
  
  Beginning in September 2012, we entered into Clinical Research Services Agreements with SGS Life Science Services (Belgium), Biomedical Systems (St. Louis, MO), and MERGE eCLinical OS (Morrisville, NC) for clinical research services relating to our CardioPET Phase II study to assess myocardial perfusion and fatty acid uptake in coronary artery disease (“CAD”) patients. The Phase IIa trial was described above As of December 31, 2016 the Company has terminated its agreement with SGS and recorded a gain on settlement of accounts payable of $84,842 in other income in the statement of operations. The Company has made all required payments to SGS and all settlement terms have been met. In addition, we engaged FGK Representative Service GmbH to serve as our sponsor in compliance with the laws governing clinical trials conducted in the European Union.   In December 2014, we announced that the enrollment for a Phase II clinical trial of CardioPET was closed. We believed that this trial had acquired sufficient patient data allowing for the assessment of the pharmaceutical's safety and quality of 18-F FCPHA generated cardiac images in humans.
  
  The Company currently maintains clinical research agreements with Pharmaceutical Product Development, LLC (Wilmington, NC), Cardiovascular Imaging Technologies (CVIT, Kansas City, MO), clinical research organizations engaged in the business of managing clinical research programs and providing clinical development and other related services, for the services relating to the BFPET Phase II study.

  Product Development and Commercialization
  
  We intend to develop our products through the completion of Phase II and/or Phase III studies at which point we will seek to partner with organizations having the resources required to undertake the further development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our proprietary products.
  
  We believe that while the overall regulatory process for molecular imaging products is currently similar to those governing therapeutic agents, the development timelines may be significantly shorter. Whereas typical clinical trials involving therapeutic agents include efficacy endpoints such as survival, time to disease progression, and progression free survival, all of which must be monitored over long periods (often years), diagnostic imaging agents often take significantly less time to evaluate. This shortened clinical development period relative to therapeutics is a function of the speed with which a molecular imaging study takes place—on the order of several hours, as compared to months. Also, because the results of the scan are instantaneous, the clinical trials do not initially require long-term follow-up for primary endpoints that may take significant periods of time to evaluate. Many PET centers in the U.S. routinely perform 5 to 20 PET scans per day. Based on the foregoing, we believe our first product may be able to be commercialized within five years.
  
  Market Opportunity
  
  Each year, millions of patients undergo molecular imaging studies in the United States. Approximately half of these studies are performed to detect and evaluate ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction in patients with acute and chronic forms of CAD. These studies provide clinical benefit in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected but unproven CAD, and in those patients in whom a diagnosis of CAD has been established and information on prognosis or risk is required. Molecular imaging studies are used for detecting the presence or absence of critical coronary artery stenosis, providing prognostic information on long-term outcomes, and stratifying patient risk for adverse cardiac events.
  
  We believe that our market opportunity is a direct function of the prevalence of coronary artery disease, and the number of molecular imaging studies anticipated to be performed per year using SPECT and PET imaging technologies. This is reflected in the more than 12 million scans in the U.S. alone for patients with suspected acute or chronic forms of CAD.  We expect the market for 18-F FTPP, if approved, will be driven by its use (i) as a blood flow imaging agent in combination with stress-testing for the identification of ischemic and infarcted tissue in patients with chronic CAD; and/or (ii) for the assessment of left ventricular mechanical function and myocardial mitochondrial membrane integrity. We expect that the market for 18-F FCPHA, if approved, will derive from the approximately 19 million patients in the U.S. annually with chronic forms of CAD and underlying metabolic disorders that contribute to high risk of diabetes and heart failure Because we believe there is no product currently on the market that may allow for an at-rest assessment of significant portions of this population, we believe 18-F FCPHA may be readily adopted by the cardiology community for the assessment of ischemia and metabolic risk in this patient pool, with the long-term goal of providing guidance for the therapeutics used for glucose and fatty acid modulation in diabetes, and ischemic or non-ischemic heart failure.
  
  Competition
  
  We operate in a highly competitive segment of the pharmaceutical market. If any of our products are approved for commercialization, we will face competition for market share from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Lantheus, Bracco, GE Healthcare and Mallinckrodt, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions engaged in the development and commercialization of existing standard of care products, as well as novel cardiac imaging agents. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than do we. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for products. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

  Intellectual Property
  
  We believe that clear and extensive patent coverage for our technologies, both domestic and international, is central to our long-term success and intend to continue to allocate resources to protection of our intellectual property accordingly. We have obtained the licenses to our patents and patent applications from MGH, the patent assignee in each case. The issued patents covering our 18-F FCPHA and 18-F FTPP technologies include both composition and method of use patents within the field of diagnostic cardiology that expire in 2025.
  
  We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
  
  Governmental Regulations
  
  Government authorities in the United States and foreign countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, sampling, marketing and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Our molecular imaging pharmaceuticals in the United States will be subject to FDA regulation as drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and require FDA approval prior to commercial distribution. The process of obtaining governmental approvals and complying with ongoing regulatory requirements requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In addition, statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and new legislation or regulations may be issued that could delay such approvals. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
  
  The U.S. regulatory scheme for the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products can be divided into three distinct stages as described below.
  
  Preclinical Stage
  
  The preclinical stage involves the characterization, product formulation and animal testing necessary to prepare an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for submission to the FDA. The IND must be reviewed and authorized by the FDA before the drug can be tested in humans. Once a new pharmaceutical agent has been identified and selected for further development, preclinical testing is conducted to confirm pharmacological activity, to generate safety data, to evaluate prototype dosage forms for appropriate release and activity characteristics, and to confirm the integrity and quality of the material to be used in clinical trials. A bulk supply of the active ingredient to support the necessary dosing in initial clinical trials must be secured. Data from the preclinical investigations and detailed information on proposed clinical investigations are compiled in an IND submission and submitted for FDA approval before human clinical trials may begin. If the FDA does not formally communicate an objection to the IND within 30 days, the specific clinical trials outlined in the IND may go forward.
 Clinical Stage
  
  The clinical stage of drug development follows a successful IND submission and involves the activities necessary to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and dosage of the substance in humans, as well as the ability to produce the substance in accordance with the FDA’s cGMP requirements. Data from these activities are compiled in a New Drug Application, or NDA, requesting approval to market the drug for a given use, or indication. Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice, and according to IND-approved protocols detailing, among other things, the study objectives and the parameters, or endpoints, to be used in assessing safety and efficacy. Each trial must be reviewed, approved and conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, and each trial, with limited exceptions, must include all subjects’ informed consent. The clinical evaluation stage typically involves the following sequential process:
  
   
-5-



 
 
  Phase I clinical trials are conducted in a limited number of healthy subjects to determine the drug’s safety, tolerability, and biological performance. The total number of subjects in Phase I clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80 people (or less in some cases, such as drugs with significant human experience).
  
  Phase II clinical trials involve administering the drug to subjects suffering from the target disease or condition to evaluate the drug’s potential efficacy and appropriate dose. The number of subjects in Phase II trials is typically several hundred subjects or less.
  
  Phase III clinical trials are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness has been obtained and safety, tolerability, and appropriate dosing have been established. Phase III clinical trials are intended to gather additional data needed to evaluate the drug’s overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate instructions for its use. Phase III trials usually include from several hundred to several thousand subjects.
  
  Throughout the clinical testing stage, samples of the product made in different batches are tested for stability to establish shelf life constraints. In addition, increasingly large-scale production protocols and written standard operating procedures must be developed for each aspect of commercial manufacture and testing.
  
  The clinical trial stage is both costly and time-consuming, and may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA can also request additional clinical testing as a condition to product approval. Additionally, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. Furthermore, institutional review boards, which are independent entities constituted to protect human subjects in the institutions in which clinical trials are being conducted, have the authority to suspend clinical trials in their respective institutions at any time for a variety of reasons, including safety issues.
  
  New Drug Application and Review
  
  After the successful completion of Phase III clinical trials, the sponsor of the new drug submits an NDA to the FDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA is a comprehensive, multi-volume application that includes, among other things, the results of all preclinical and clinical studies, information about the drug’s composition, and the sponsor’s plans for producing, packaging, and labeling the drug. In most cases, the NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. FDA has 60 days after submission to review the completeness and organization of the application, and may refuse to accept it for continued review, or refuse to file, if the application is found deficient. After filing, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use. Drugs that successfully complete NDA review may be marketed in the United States, subject to all conditions imposed by the FDA.
  
  Prior to granting approval, the FDA generally conducts an inspection of the facilities, including outsourced facilities that will be involved in the manufacture, production, packaging, testing and control of the drug product for cGMP compliance. The FDA will not approve the application unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA determines that the marketing application, manufacturing process, or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and will often request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the marketing application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the application by issuing a “not approvable” letter.
  
  The length of the FDA’s review can range from a few months to several years or more. Once an NDA is in effect, significant changes such as the addition of one or more new indications for use generally require prior approval of an NDA including additional clinical trials or other data required to demonstrate that the product as modified remains safe and effective.

  Fast Track Review
  
  The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, or the Modernization Act, establishes a statutory program for relatively streamlined approval of “Fast Track” products, which are defined under the Modernization Act as new drugs or biologics intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition that demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition. Fast Track status requires an official designation by the FDA.
 Abbreviated New Drug Application and Review
  
  An Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, is a type of NDA that is used for the review and approval of a generic drug product. A generic drug product is one that is the same as a previously approved innovator drug product, which means it has the same active ingredient, dosage form, and strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use. An ANDA is generally not required to include preclinical and clinical data to establish safety and effectiveness. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to the previously approved drug, which means that it performs in the same manner. None of the products currently under development by FluoroPharma will be eligible for ANDA approval, although it is possible that competing products based on our product could be approved by this route at some future time.
 Section 505(b)(2) Applications
  
  If a proposed drug product represents only a limited change from a product that has already been approved by the FDA, yet differs in more ways than those permitted under the ANDA requirements, then the applicant may be able to submit a type of NDA referred to as a 505(b)(2) application. In effect, a 505(b)(2) applicant is permitted to rely on information in the scientific literature, or previous safety and efficacy determinations by the FDA, rather than submitting the full complement of clinical or other data that would otherwise be required for NDA approval. However, the 505(b)(2) sponsor must provide any additional clinical or other data needed to supplement and/or establish the relevance and applicability of prior findings for the new product formulation. We do not expect any of our current drug portfolio to be granted approval via this process as our products are novel and patent protected.
  
  Post-Approval Phase
  
  Once the FDA has approved a new drug for marketing, the product becomes available for physicians to prescribe in the United States. After approval, we must comply with post-approval requirements, including ongoing compliance with cGMP regulations, delivering periodic reports to the FDA, submitting descriptions of any adverse reactions reported, and complying with drug sampling and distribution requirements. We are required to maintain and provide updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA. We are also required to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling.
  
  Compliance with post-approval requirements will require us to expend time, money, and effort on an ongoing basis. We expect to use third party manufacturers to produce certain of our products in clinical and commercial quantities. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.
  
  In addition, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with requirements may result in restrictions including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary or FDA-initiated action that could delay further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications. Also, the FDA may require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy, including additional clinical studies, known as Phase IV trials, to evaluate long-term effects.

  Other Regulation in the United States
  
  Healthcare Reimbursement
  
  Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical products. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private healthcare insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for procedures or treatments. This has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for diagnostic products. Even though a new medical product may have been cleared for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the product until full reimbursement approval has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers.
 Environmental Regulation
  
  We are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the United States. Like many other pharmaceutical and medical device companies, our operations involve the use of substances, including hazardous wastes, which are regulated under environmental laws, primarily manufacturing and sterilization processes. We do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. These laws and regulations are all subject to change, however, and we cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes might have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Foreign Regulation
  
  Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country. Although governed by the applicable jurisdiction, clinical trials conducted outside of the United States typically are administered under a three-phase sequential process similar to that discussed above for pharmaceutical products.
  
  Under European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is available for medicines produced by biotechnology or which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. This authorization is a marketing authorization approval, or MAA. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. This procedure is referred to as the mutual recognition procedure, or MRP.
  
  In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the United States. We face the risk that the prices which result from the regulatory approval process would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or our collaborators. 
  
  Employees
  
  As of December 31, 2016, we had four full-time employees.
