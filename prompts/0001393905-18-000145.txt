Company History

Spindle, Inc. is a merchant of commerce solutions focused on the Small and Medium-sized Business (SMB) market. The Company was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 8, 2007 as Coyote Hills Golf, Inc. We were previously an online retailer of golf-related apparel, equipment and supplies. Prior to the acquisition of the assets of Spindle Mobile, Inc. (Spindle Mobile), as described below, we generated minimal revenues from the golf-related business.

On December 2, 2011, we acquired certain assets and intellectual property from Spindle Mobile, a Delaware corporation in the business of data processing, mobile payments fields and other related fields, in exchange for approximately 80% of our issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, which shares were distributed to the stockholders of Spindle Mobile, Inc., pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Spindle Mobile Agreement"). 

Concurrent with the closing of the Spindle Mobile Agreement, we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name from "Coyote Hills Golf, Inc." to "Spindle, Inc." Additionally, we changed our authorized capital from 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, and 50,000,000 preferred stock, $0.001 par value. The actions were approved on November 11, 2011, by the consent of the majority stockholders who represented 90% of our issued and outstanding common stock, and were effective on December 2, 2011.

On December 31, 2012 (the Parallel Acquisition Closing Date), pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the Parallel Agreement) by and between the Company and Parallel Solutions Inc., a Nevada corporation (Parallel), the Company acquired, substantially all of Parallels assets used in connection with its business of facilitating electronic payment processing services to merchants (the Parallel Assets), assumed certain specified liabilities and hired seven employees of Parallel in exchange for 538,570 unregistered shares of common stock, of which 53,857 shares (the "Parallel Indemnification Escrow") and 100,000 shares (the "Parallel Deferred Consent Escrow) were deposited in escrow with our transfer agent. The Parallel Indemnification Escrow was released on January 23, 2014. On October 29, 2013, the Parallel Deferred Consent Escrow was released to Parallel after certain specified contract assignments and residual revenue streams were assigned to the Company pursuant to the Parallel Agreement. 

On March 20, 2013 (the MeNetwork Closing Date), the Company assumed certain liabilities and acquired substantially all of the assets of MeNetwork, Inc., a Delaware corporation (MeNetwork), (2) on March 20, 2013, substantially all of the assets of MeNetwork, Inc. (MeNetwork) used in connection with its business of developing, marketing and licensing a mobile marketing platform for use by merchants and consumers (the MeNetwork Assets), pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated March 1, 2013 by and between Spindle and MeNetwork (the MeNetwork Agreement). As consideration for the assumption of the liabilities and the acquisition of the MeNetwork Assets, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,750,000 shares of common stock to the stockholders of MeNetwork, of which 350,000 were deposited in escrow with our transfer agent for the purposes of satisfying any indemnification claims. The MeNetwork Indemnification Escrow was released pursuant to the MeNetwork Agreement. On October 7, 2013, the Company issued an additional 750,000 shares of common stock to Ashton Craig Page, the former director and Chief Operating Officer of MeNetwork and a former director of the Company, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the MeNetwork Agreement. On December 12, 2014, the Company, and Ashton Craig Page, in his capacity as the representative of MeNetwork and the MeNetwork Stockholders (the Representative), entered into an Amendment and Waiver to Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Amendment), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and the Representative agreed to accept on behalf of MeNetwork and the MeNetwork Stockholders an acceleration of the issuance of up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 Earnout Shares on or before December 31, 2014 in full satisfaction of all obligations of the Company to issue the Earnout Shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement during the Earnout Period. These shares were issued on December 23, 2014.

On January 3, 2014, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Y Dissolution, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as Yowza International, Inc.) (Yowza!!), used in connection with the business of providing retail coupons through a mobile application pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated December 10, 2013, by and between the Company and Yowza!! in exchange for $500,000 and 1,642,000 unregistered shares of the Companys common stock issued to (1) the holders of Yowza!!s outstanding capital stock, and (2) certain executive management members and advisors of Yowza!!.

On October 23, 2015 (the Closing Date) the Company completed the acquisition of specific assets of Catalyst Business Development, Inc. (Catalyst) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated September 14, 2015, by and between the Company and Catalyst in exchange for 300,000 unregistered shares of the Companys common stock issued to the holders of Catalyst stock. The consideration amounted to $75,000 using a fair value of $0.25 per share at the Closing Date. The assets acquired include a white-labeled license of the Merchant Partners solution and various assets related to branding, marketing and sales. We continue to operate the gateway under the Catalyst brand.

Because we are still growing our business, we have not earned enough revenue to support our operations and we are not profitable. To date, we have funded our operations through sales of our equity securities and loans from related parties. We cannot guarantee that we will ever be profitable. 

Business Description

Spindle provides payment processing services to merchants using its Catalyst Gateway, and acts as an agent, independent contractor or referral partner to broker merchants that it secures to other merchant processors for ongoing fees based on processing volume. Spindle serves Small to Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) in these capacities. Spindles Catalyst Gateway currently has Eurocard-MasterCard-Visa (EMV) ready solutions and is PCI compliant, but WorldPay, licensor of our gateway, has advised us that they will no longer provide platform updates as it transitions to more current gateway platforms. While Spindle can still use the Catalyst Gateway, and currently has some merchants on the platform, we have decided to board future merchants on third-party platforms as described above.
Catalyst Gateway

Spindle acquired the Catalyst Gateway license as part of the asset acquisition from Catalyst Business Development, Inc. which was finalized on October 23, 2015. The Catalyst Gateway is a branded license of the Merchant Partners software. The gateway license was contracted for Spindle directly with WorldPay, the current domestic master license holder for the Merchant Partners gateway software. While Spindle will be able to continue to operate its gateway, WorldPay has informed its licensees that it will no longer provide platform updates. 
Market Conditions in the Payment Processing Industry

The payment processing industry will continue to evolve and experience new market entrants with new technology and security regulations. As merchants and acquiring banks seek services to enhance their own offerings to consumers, EMV chip-based cards are required to be adopted to maintain current security standards. As EMV becomes more widely adopted, the industry expects a redistribution of fraud to points left vulnerable, thus there will be a need for adapted security and fraud management services, information services, and support for omni-commerce environments. To meet this evolving need, payment processing companies will need to provide solutions and training to their merchants to ensure best practices for security and compliance are adopted.
Competition

Merchant Services

The merchant services business is highly competitive. Competitors range from the large acquiring banks like Bank of America Merchant Services, to Chase Paymentech, to smaller MSPs who specialize in specific verticals. The most significant competitive factors in our segment are price, breadth of features and functionality, data security, system performance and reliability.

Payment processing services are becoming commoditized, driving MSPs, ISOs and payment processors to seek out new value-added features and benefits to add to their platforms to not only attract, but also retain merchants. 

2017 Business Strategy

Because of Spindles belief that the combination of marketing services combined with payment processing could create a strategic advantage in boarding merchants (unified commerce), during 2017 Spindle shifted its activities from the highly competitive payment processing arena, to developing marketing tools to go along with payment processing to create a unified commerce experience for merchants. Spindles marketing development efforts occurred under the Catalyst brand. 

Spindles plan was to attract, market to, and retain its customers though the expansion of the Catalyst platform, as well as process payments for goods and services sold through it. The marketing development initiatives included the following areas:

·
 Spindle began developing a vertical platform called Catalyst Team Sports (www.catalystteamsports.com), a tool for sports coaches to manage team activities, including player statistics, a social media utility to communicate with players and their parents regarding practices and games, and other planned functions such as fund-raising and the ability to purchase sports gear on the website; 

·
 Spindle began developing a second sports platform, Sports Payment Pros (www.sportspaymentpros.com) to primarily target sports facilities (batting cages, indoor/outdoor practice facilities, etc.); 

·
 Spindle began developing a broader marketing initiative, the Catalyst Marketing System (www.catalystmarketingsystems.com), to provide a broad range of pay-for marketing services for merchants, intended to be tied in to the Catalyst Gateway. 

While significant progress was made on these projects, due to a lack of funding, we were unable to deliver completed, commercially viable products. Delays in the execution of project timelines led to delays in sales and ultimately resulted in cash constraints whereby costs had to be reduced and the projects shelved. While the above websites are still live, there is currently no business activity on any of them. 

Spindle then diverted its resources to developing a merchant pipeline, exclusively for payment processing services. Through 2017, we were not able to generate significant sales from our merchant processing efforts. 

Acquisitions

In September 2017, Spindle was introduced to a privately held, profitable, payment processing company (the Target) desiring to become part of an existing public company in the payment processing space. On October 2, 2017, we signed a binding term sheet to acquire the Target. On December 31, 2017, the term sheet was extended until March 31, 2018, and on March 31, 2018, it was subsequently extended to April 6, 2018. On April 6, 2018, we signed an Asset Purchase Agreement (the APA) with the Target.

 The APA outlines the terms of the Target acquisition which is stated to close on May 15, 2018. Since the transaction is not yet closed, and there are conditions precedent to closing, the financial terms of the APA and the Targets name have been redacted. The conditions precedent to closing include a third party valuation of the Target, employment agreements for the Targets CEO and the CTO, both of whom would hold the same positions with Spindle, asset transfer approvals, availability of cash for the asset purchase, among other conditions outlined in the APA.

Employees

We currently have two full-time employees in client services and technical administration and implementation. We also have one contract employee engaged in accounting. We work with outside consultants at times and we have no labor union contracts. 
Government Regulations

We are subject to regulations that affect the electronic payment industry in which our service is used. In particular, the banks and financial institutions that we provide services to are subject to regulations applicable in the United States and abroad, and, consequently, we may be affected by such regulations. Regulation of the financial services industry has seen rapid change in recent years, including the passage of the Patriot Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, including the Durbin Amendment (the Dodd-Frank Act). The Dodd-Frank Act establishes regulation and oversight by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of debit interchange rates and certain other network industry practices.

Among other things, it requires debit and prepaid interchange transaction fees (referred to in the Dodd-Frank Act as fees established, charged or received by a payment card network for the purpose of compensating an issuer for its involvement in an electronic debit transaction) to be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction. We believe that, as a small issuer with less than $10 billion in assets, our payment service is exempt from this provision of the Dodd-Frank Act. If at any time these regulations should change, there would be an impact on our business model due to the costs of compliance with such regulations.

Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that neither an issuer nor a payment card network may establish exclusive debit network arrangements or inhibit the ability of a merchant to choose among different networks for routing debit transactions. Under alternative rules proposed by the Federal Reserve, either (1) a debit card would meet the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act if it could be used in at least two unaffiliated networks, or (2) each debit card would be required to function in at least two unaffiliated networks for each method of authorization that the cardholder could use for transactions (i.e., two signatures and/or two PIN networks).

The Dodd-Frank Act also created two new independent regulatory bodies in the Financial Reserve System. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products, including consumer credit, deposit, payment, and similar products; although it is not clear whether and/or to what extent the Bureau will be authorized to regulate broader aspects of payment card network operations. The Financial Stability Oversight Council is tasked, among other responsibilities, with identifying systemically important payment, clearing and settlement systems that will be subject to new regulation, supervision and examination requirements, although it is not clear whether Spindle would be deemed systemically important under the applicable statutory standard. If Spindle were deemed to be systemically important, it could be subject to new risk management regulations relating to its payment, clearing, and settlement activities. New regulations could address areas such as risk management policies and procedures; collateral requirements; participant default policies and procedures; the ability to complete timely clearing and settlement of financial transactions; and capital and financial resource requirements. In addition, a systemically important payment system could be required to obtain prior approval from the U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or another federal agency for changes to its system rules, procedures or operations that could materially affect the level of risk presented by that payment system. These developments or actions could increase the cost of operating our business and may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers, as well as consumers. This could result in a reduction in our payments volume and revenues.
