ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2013, under the name of All Soft Gels, Inc.
 
All Soft Gels, Inc. was formed to market the sale of soft gel liquid capsules (named All Soft Gels Kre-Alkalyn Liquid Gels).
 
On November 27, 2017, Gene Nelson, our founder, largest stockholder, and sole executive officer and director, sold all of his shares of common stock of the Company to Amer Samad, resulting in a change of control of the Company; however, such shares remain in Mr. Nelson’s name pursuant to the stock transfer records of the Company, and are expected to be transferred in name to Mr. Samad in July 2018. As part of that transaction, Mr. Nelson resigned from all of his officer and director positions, and Mr. Samad was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company, and was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company.
 
All Soft Gels, Inc. has not commenced its major operations of having its one product, a soft-gel capsule named All Soft Gels Kre-Alkalyn Liquid Gels, manufactured by an unaffiliated outside provider. However, the Company has distributed the product through limited sales on the Amazon.com website. As a result of the change of control transaction referred to above, we have suspended operations and are not currently marketing or seeking to manufacture All Soft Gels Kre-Alkalyn Liquid Gels, although we may recommence such operations in the future. As a result, we can be considered a shell company.
 
In addition, the Company has generated $7,022 of revenue in connection with its business for the year ended December 31, 2017 and none in 2016.
 
We do not have any definitive plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with any representatives of the owners of any operating business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger. However, we are currently in negotiations with Memory MD, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“MemoryMD”), with respect to a potential reorganization pursuant to which, as currently contemplated, we would acquire MemoryMD as our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and the stockholders of MemoryMD would exchange all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MemoryMD currently held by them for shares of the Company’ common stock (the “Proposed Transaction”). As the definitive agreement and other transaction documents are still being prepared and negotiated, and the parties are still performing due diligence, we can give no assurance as to the ultimate form or terms of the Proposed Transaction or that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated at all.
 
 Description of Liquid Gels Assets
 
The product is a liquid gel capsule containing soybean oil, kre-alkalyn creatine, gelatin, glycerin, L-glutamic acid, yellow beeswax, purified water, L-leucine, L-Arginine, and lecithin. The product is to be taken orally, preferably with water. Upon digestion, the product is absorbed to provide increased blood flow for enhanced workout ability leading to improved strength and muscle gain. One serving is two capsules per day. The product is to be used as part of a fitness and training program, and maximum benefit will occur when used in conjunction with a weight training regimen. Intended customers are adults (persons over 18 years of age) involved in fitness or weight training.
 
As a dietary supplement, there are no FDA requirements on this product. The Company has not sent the product to the FDA for approval because it is not required, and because it would be a lengthy and costly process to have this product FDA approved when not required.
 
Development of the capsules is complete, although manufacturing of the capsules will be ongoing if we recommence operations with respect to these assets and then at least initially as supply and demand dictates.

All Soft Gels, Inc. has nothing proprietary about its product. At this time, All Soft Gels, Inc. has no intellectual property in connection with the capsules. However, we believe our product is superior that of the competition due to the Kre-Alkalyn creatine being in a soft gel form, avoiding substantial product break down before digestion as we believe happens with competitors’ products.
 
The competition for and difficulty in selling energy Gel Caps would likely affect our ability to develop profitable operations in the future if we recommence operations with respect to these assets. Companies that are engaged in energy Gel Caps retail products include large, established companies with substantial capabilities and long earnings records.
 
Employees
 
At this time, we have no employees other than our executive officer who is also a director. We retain consultants from time to time to assist with administrative functions.
 
We do not foresee any significant changes in the number of employees or consultants we will have over the next twelve months, unless we enter into a definitive agreement with MemoryMD or another operating company, and the Proposed Transaction or similar transaction is consummated.
