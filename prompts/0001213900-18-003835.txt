(FL), a corporation organized under the laws of Florida (the “Acquiree”), and each of the Persons who are shareholders of the Acquiree (collectively, the “Acquiree Shareholders,” and individually an “Acquiree Shareholder”) entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which the Acquiree Shareholders (who are the holders of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Acquiree (the “Acquiree Interests”)) have agreed to transfer to the Acquiror, and the Acquiror has agreed to acquire from the Acquiree Shareholders, all of the Acquiree Interests, in exchange for the issuance of 520,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 500,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, to the Acquiree Shareholders the “Acquiror Shares”), which Acquiror Shares shall, upon conversion into 102,000,000 shares of common stock of the Acquiror, constitute approximately 85.84% on a fully diluted basis of the issued and outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock immediately after the closing of the transactions contemplated herein, in each case, on the terms and conditions as set forth in the Agreement. For accounting purposes, the Share Exchange was treated as an acquisition of Acquiror and a recapitalization of Acquiree. Acquiree is the accounting acquirer, and the result is of its operations carryover. On the Closing Date, Acquiror Principal Shareholder entered into a Spin Off Agreement with Acquiror for the sale of the existing wholly owned Vapir, Inc. subsidiary of the Acquiror in exchange for Acquiror Principal Shareholder’s shares of Common Stock of Acquiror. The Spin Off Agreement shall not close less than five (5) days from the closing of the Agreement. As of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the disposition of the Company’s Vapir business has not been consummated. This Business description described both the traditional business of the Company as it existed on December 31, 2017, the end of the fiscal year for which this Form 10-K is filed, and the new business of Gratitude Health, Inc. after the March 26, 2018 share exchange.
 
Business of Vapir, Inc.
 
Vapir, Inc. specializes in the revolutionary technology of digital aromatherapy which is the art and science of utilizing naturally extracted aromatic essences from plants to balance and harmonize while freshening the environment with pleasant and distinctive fragrances. We invent, develop and produce revolutionary and easy to use digital aromatherapy devices. The unique value proposition of the Company’s proprietary technology (US Patent 6,095,153) is to prevent the creation of toxic by-products whenever plant materials are inhaled. This is accomplished by using convection heat that induces the safe release of plant essences without burning the source material. Our devices are designed in San Jose, California and manufactured in Guang Dong, China.
Our Industry
 
In general, “Vaporizers” are battery-powered products that enable users to inhale vapor without smoke, Vaporizers are not like traditional cigarettes, and their construction is comprised of three functional components:

● | Digital temperature control, means you have the ability to choose the warmth of your vaporizer’s heating element. The heating element that vaporizes liquid and/or botanicals so that it can be inhaled; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Vaporizers either heat the liquid or botanicals with direct contact with a heating element (conduction) or by exposing the herb to hot air (convection); and 
● | Vaporizers require energy when hot. Depending on the intention behind the vaporizer’s design - the energy source will match the portable or stationary model paradigm.

Our Products
 
Vaporizers
 
As of December 31, 2017, we marketed 5 vaporizers, the Prima, VapirRise 2.0 ultimate, VAPIR NO2 Portable Digital Vaporizer and VAPIR Oxygen Mini Corded Vaporizer, and the New Vapir Pen.
 
Prima
 


Prima is a digital vaporizer that supports extracts and botanicals. The unit is equipped with a removable/rechargeable lithium battery, a removable stainless steel vapor path and removable mouth piece which allows for easy cleaning, and four (4) pre-set temperatures which maintains pre-set heat levels by turning the heating element on and off as needed. Once the optimal temperature is reached, a green light on the casing will indicate that the device is now ready. This relatively simple technology enables the vaporizers to maintain heat levels.

● | Prima measures in at just 4.7 inches, and weighs 5.7 oz, and comes in four (4) different colors (Blue, Black, Silver, and Orange).

The VapirRise 2.0 Ultimate is designed for loose-leaf herbs and essential oils. It supports both balloon inflation and direct inhalation. It can serve up to 4 users simultaneously. It has touch pad controls, an LCD temperature display and medical grade stainless steel vapir path and a ceramic heating element.
 
As the ceramic heating element of the device reaches the pre-set temperature, a fan blows air through the heating element. A sensor, which is located in the chamber of the unit, will constantly monitor the air temperature and maintain pre-set heat levels by turning the heating element on and off as needed. Once the optimal temperature is reached, a green light on the casing will indicate that the device is now ready. This relatively simple technology enables the vaporizers to maintain heat levels.
 
This convection vaporizer is a stationary desktop model - which means it isn’t intended for on-the-go consumption. The VapirRise offers an exceptional approach to the at-home vaporization experience.
 
Users can control the temperature (in both degrees Celsius & Fahrenheit); control the Fan Speed (ten options including a fanless setting); pick between a balloon or hose inhalation methods; and choose to serve up to four people at once with the exclusive hookah adapter.
 
VAPIR NO2 Portable Digital Vaporizer
 


The VAPIR NO2 is designed for loose-leaf herbs and direct inhalation. It is compact, portable and rechargeable. It has a medical grade pure brass element, an LCD temperature display and a silent operation. The VAPIR NO2 will be your number one portable vaporizer.
 
This compact portable vaporizer features touch-to-heat digital controls, an LCD thermostat, an internal rechargeable battery, and 100% silent operation. The NO2 vaporizer is designed for use with raw herbs and heats up in less than a minute. You can even vaporize while it’s charging.
 
The NO2 requires little to no maintenance for optimal operation and it even remembers your favorite temperature settings for quick and consistent vapor at the touch of a button.

VAPIR OXYGEN MINI CORDED
  
The VAPIR Oxygen Mini Corded is designed for loose-leaf herbs and direct inhalation. It is small and lightweight and is a corded vaporizer. It has an LCD temperature display and silent operation. Every portable vaporizer needs to produce clouds, not a mere mist. The Vapir Oxygen lets you live and breathe premium vapor.

The Vapir Pen is a sleek and portable device that may be used with both concentrate and wax substances. It features an ergonomic mouthpiece that leads to a deep chamber. The Vapir Pen comes equipped with two different type of atomizers; the Coil-less Ceramic Atomizer and the Quartz Double-Rod Titanium Atomizer, both with Ceramic Chamber. The temperature controlled battery allows for a range of 3 pre-set temperatures. The Vapir Pen is directly charged through a Micro USB charging port at the bottom of the battery. This feature allows the device to be charged with any regular USB charger anywhere, whether at home or on the go. It is also included a USB charging cord in the box that can be connected directly to the device. The Vapir Pen has an elevated air flow system which reduces the likelihood of clogging or leakage.
 
Our Vaporizers and Accessories
 
Our vaporizers are sold with all the essentials that are needed to begin the vaporizing experience. In addition to the vaporizers, we also sell approximately 100 different accessories and spare parts that ranges from replacement batteries, replacement mouthpieces, recharging pieces, and all other essential accessories and spare parts.
 
Seasonality of our Business
 
We do not consider our business to be seasonal.
 
Marketing
 
We offer our vaporizers and related products through our website, distributors, online stores and retail stores. Retailers of our products include small-box smoke shops, vape stores, and online retailers throughout the United States and the world.
Competition
 
Competition in the vaporizer industry is intense and we anticipate that competition will likely remain intense for the foreseeable future. We compete with other sellers of vaporizers that are similar to our products and our competitors use the same sales practices and marketing strategies as we use and as a result, we face a continuing challenge in attempting to differentiate our products.
 
The nature of our competitors is varied as the market is highly fragmented and the barriers to entry into the business are low. Our direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to ours and through the same channels through which we sell our vaporizers. We compete with these direct competitors for sales through distributors, wholesalers and retailers and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in meeting the competitive challenges that we face that will allow us to achieve unit sales volumes at levels that will allow us to achieve profitability and positive cash flow or if we achieve either or both of these objectives, that we can sustain either or both thereafter.
 
Our current competitive position in the vaporizer industry is difficult to gauge as most of our competition are also smaller companies or are privately held and do not publicly report their earnings. We do know of several competitors, but, like us, many are in their initial stages of development and are focusing on different areas of this industry. We also believe that the industry likely will attract other larger companies that possess greater financial and managerial resources with the result that we are likely to face greater competitive pressures that will adversely affect our sales volume, profits, and cash flow.
 
As a general matter, we have access to and market and sell similar products as our competitors, and since we sell our products at substantially similar prices as our competitors; accordingly, the key competitive factors for our success is the quality of service and design we offer our customers, the scope and effectiveness of our marketing efforts, including media advertising campaigns and, increasingly, the ability to identify and develop new sources of customers by attending trade shows and word of mouth. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts or, if we are successful, that we can maintain any competitive advantages that we may currently have.

Regulatory Matters/Compliance
 
The United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) regulates electronic cigarettes as “tobacco products” under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (the “Tobacco Control Act”). The FDA is not permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as “drugs” or “devices” or a “combination product” under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act unless they are marketed for therapeutic purposes.
 
The Tobacco Control Act imposes significant new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products. The law also requires the FDA to issue future regulations regarding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products sold or distributed over the internet, by mail order or through other non-face-to-face transactions in order to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors.
 
It is likely that the Tobacco Control Act could result in a decrease in tobacco product sales in the United States, including sales of our electronic cigarettes and vaporizers.
 
The Tobacco industry expects significant regulatory developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:
 

● | the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship; 
● | the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements; 
● | restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging; 
● | restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; 
● | requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents levels; 
● | requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients; 
● | increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors; 
● | elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and 
● | encouraging litigation against tobacco companies. 

 
If electronic cigarettes or vaporizers are subject to one or more significant regulatory initiatives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
We currently own four domestic utility patents and two design patents relating to vaporizers, as well as two utility patent applications and one design application pending in the United States as described below. There is no assurance that we will be awarded patents for of any of these pending patent applications. Further, we have not obtained an independent evaluation of our patent tights or any of our intellectual property rights. As a result, we cannot assure you that our patents and all of our intellectual property rights do not infringe upon those rights claimed by others. In that event we may be exposed to superior claims asserted by others and thereby we may be liable for significant damages arising out of any such infringement claims.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we have three full-time and two part-time employees. None of these employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements and the Company considers it relations with its employees to be good.
Business of Gratitude Health, Inc.
 
Effective March 26, 2018, we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Acquiree pursuant to the Exchange Agreement and Acquiree became our wholly-owned subsidiary. The acquisition was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein Acquiree is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of Acquiree have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized.
 
At the time of the acquisition, the Company was engaged in the business of engaged in inventing, developing and producing aromatherapy devices and vaporizers. As a result of the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Acquiree, we have now assumed Acquiree’s business operations as our own. The acquisition of Acquiree is treated as a reverse acquisition, and the business of Acquiree became the business of the Company.
 
Business Plan
 
The Company manufactures, sells and markets functional RTD (Ready to Drink) beverages sold under the Gratitude trademark. The Company’s first five drinks are Chinese Dragon Well Green Teas. Second and third functional-drink lines are now in development. The Gratitude mission is to disrupt this beverage market through our manufacturing and marketing of functional beverages that specifically promote healthy aging and to never produce a product that in any way will adversely affect the health of our customer. The Gratitude vision is to work with research partners to develop functional drinks that can easily be incorporated into one’s daily lifestyle and fit their nutritional goals.
THE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING:
 
Gratitude Health, Inc. is building the “Gratitude” brand with the launch of unique, naturally flavored and unsweetened RTD (Ready To Drink) teas.
 
Today, tea is the second largest drink category in America and is an obvious driver and mainstay in delivery systems across food and beverage categories. Americans and, especially, Millennial Americans are increasingly becoming more and more aware of the generous levels of cancer-fighting antioxidants found in tea.
 
While Green, White and Black teas are the most common types consumed in America, research shows that their growth is solid year-over-year but barely above flat. We believe this is due to two factors:
 

● | The category is staid and boring and, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------
● | RTD teas are not delivering on their health promises. 

 
We will address these issues with unique varieties of tea that not only have interesting and curious names but also health research that supports their benefits. Naturally, we will be calorie and carb free and always strive for maximum antioxidant delivery. Our teas are sourced from Dragon Well in China. Our initial five flavors are:
 

● | Wildberry 
--+-----------------
● | Blood Orange 
● | Mint 
● | Original 
● | Peach

Supporting these unique flavors and key to our brand-building presentation will be our package, a first-to- RTD-market “mason jar” like 16-oz bottle featuring artistic, graphic designs actually etched onto the glass-container.
 
We will promote this unique presentation as more than eco-friendly (“eco” being of great importance to millennials) because they will be collectibles and advertised as such thus making their collectability and reuse arguably the eco-friendliest mass-market beverage bottle in the world. To even further support this unique presentation, artistic and colorful labels (logo, art, nutritional and redemption information) will cover the etchings driving the desires for those that keep them to buy their “missing” collectible.
 
Interestingly, the 2017 Natural Beverage Guide (Bevnet, Inc) displays hundreds of Natural-Drink companies and not one has a “Mason” jar configuration. We believe this packaging will be widely preferred to the predominantly plastic bottles in the market today, we further expect modern consumers to understand and appreciate the flavor profile and obvious nutritional benefits of the teas.
 


Having identified the opportunity and clearly focused upon the healthy features and benefits available in Gratitude’s tea offerings, Gratitude will shortly introduce its first five flavors of tea. This will kick off sales efforts in earnest for the larger chained retail accounts across the Country. These accounts generally review new products for “planogram” resets during calendar Q-1 with a view to begin new product offering and new sets in April each year.
 
This gives Gratitude three months to sell and arrange for new product authorizations in regional and national accounts while managing our initial placements in New York City and smaller accounts with whom we have relationships in the Northeastern United States.

MARKET INFORMATION AND THE VALUE CHAIN AND ROUTES TO MARKET
 
According to Beverage Marketing Corporation’s 2017 “DrinkTell” database, RTD tea sales totaled $10.31 billion in 2017 up four percent. Importantly, Gratitude’s market analyses and product development perfectly targets the main attributes fueling this growth. According to this database, “Ready-to-drink tea is leading the growth in its category with new forms and formulations that offer both function and flavor. Consumers are willing to trade up to products that offer them better quality or benefits.” Further according to BMC, “Retailers say refrigerated RTD teas are the leading segment in this category, and new varieties are emerging. In the RTD tea category, reduced-sugar formulations and local and artisanal brands are poised for continued growth.”
 
We are the first company to introduce Chinese Dragon Well Tea to the mass RTD American market. Dragon Well is subtle in taste with a hint of chestnut and is the most popular tea in China being granted “Imperial” status. Because it is “Green”, our tea will be well known to the US consumer. Because it is “DragonWell”, it will be a welcome new experience to the US RTD market. All our teas are either low calorie--45 per 16z—or totally unsweetened. Our “small batch * hand made” brand positioning features totally unique and first-to-market packaging that meets artisanal characteristics influencing today’s consumer purchase.
 
According to the Tea Association of the USA, in its 2017-2018 Tea Market Review and Forecast, Ready-to-drink (RTD) tea accounted for some 45.7% of the tea market share in 2017 and will exceed 1.7 billion gallons in 2017. The Review states “Specialty Tea is still driving interest and consumption in the category with consumers grazing for new and different options and flavors and origins. Sustainability of these high quality, higher priced teas confirms that the analogy to wine is stronger than ever.” Furthermore, according to the Tea Association: “Naturalness continues to drive consumers who demand foods that are closer to their unrefined or pure state, seeking “less processed” drinks, incentivizing companies to remove artificial ingredients. This trend will also encourage consumers to reach for foods in their most natural, original form, such as true teas, for health benefits, instead of supplements and nutraceuticals. Tea is a natural, simple and whole food.”
 
By marrying a famous and revered green tea in China with such organic flavors as Peach, Mint, Wildberry and Blood Orange and putting those complementary flavors in a totally unique glass package, Gratitude is well positioned for our targeted consumer audience.
 
Gratitude’s retail shelf price is between $2.99 to $3.49 per bottle. We have established cost for finished product per bottle and per 12-count case. We will approach and engage the same retail systems and value chain structure relative to all RTD beverage brands in the industry.

There will be three routes to market:
 

1. | Direct-to-Retail sales (grocery, big box, and drug chains). 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Direct Store Delivery (DSD) with shelf management for C-stores, specialty accounts, and such institutions as colleges and universities. 
3. | Direct-to-Consumer sales via the internet. We will partner with Amazon for fulfillment. 


1. | Value chain for channel one includes delivered pricing from Gratitude direct to the retailer. We will target a suggested retail price in these accounts. Knowing that these accounts demand net delivery to their warehouses and a SET gross margin, Gratitude will price cases at wholesale to this channel of trade at a set price per bottle per cost of goods sold as calculated so that the Company has already calculated its margin less cost of freight for delivery. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Sales to DSD delivery systems require a more competitive wholesale price and higher retail price, which enables a structure where a distributor can earn a meaningful margin in an extremely competitive environment. The DSD retail customer is often a C-Store or Specialty store that requires regular deliveries and in-store management of inventory in “reaches”, meaning that often the DSD merchandises the shelf for his customer. This service cost is passed to the wholesaler. Therefore, to accommodate this pricing model, Gratitude must be more competitively priced to the DSD. The retailer also needs room to mark up the brand to accommodate their gross margin goals. So, Gratitude will reduce its gross margin in this channel and the DSD distributor will expect a set gross margin. The C-Store retailer usually expects a minimum set gross margin at his level. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The third sales model is direct consumer sales through the internet. These sales are always made by the case with an added delivery fee to the individual. We will partner with Amazon to handle orders and fulfillment and simply deliver to their regional warehouses. These sales provide great opportunity for gross margin having eliminated the distributor and retailer margin, but require significant digital marketing programs and advertising. We will use this channel immediately to service consumers that have heard of the brand but can’t find it at their local store yet. We know this channel will not be a large business initially but, as the brand grows, we plan to build this segment aggressively.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND PHILANTHROPY
 
Gratitude’s RD&P (Research, Development and Philanthropy) is working with a number of institutions to develop, license and/or acquire valid and proven intellectual property that fights cancer and promotes healthy aging. To that end, Gratitude has solely licensed patented technology from a prominent U.S. university research foundation for their patent (U.S. Patent #: 6,713,605) for the use of tea polyphenol esters for cancer prevention and treatment. The patented invention relates to novel polyphenol esters derived from green teas, which are potent inhibitors of the growth of cancerous cells, and their use in the prevention and treatment of conditions characterized by abnormal cellular proliferation. Gratitude will fund our charities from our sales and, in addition to giving away product to those who cannot afford them, we will contribute to university and institutional research studies that focus on chemo-protection, healthy aging, phytochemical superfoods and clean nutrition.
