The Pulse Network was established in June 1994 and currently operates from offices located at 10 Oceana Way, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062. The Pulse Network’s website is www.tpni.com.
 
On January 31, 2014, The Pulse Network launched a cloud-based comprehensive content marketing platform which empowers corporate marketers and event groups in their campaign efforts. The platform solution addresses the challenges consumers face when seeking information and content surrounding a company well as the corporate content marketing problems that businesses face in trying to ensure that their content is seen by the right audience. 
 
The new platform incorporates flat design, an enhanced layout, new icons and more typography, all of which can be translated to any language, significantly benefiting The Pulse Network’s international clients. In addition to the new design, the platform is highly organized for both event marketers and content marketers and combines the registration technology with asset creation, curation, distribution, and management to be used by all types of businesses and consumers. By bringing all the modules together under one platform, The Pulse Network is releasing a completely unique and powerful tool that will be used for hundreds of global programs on six continents. The fully integrated platform is comprised of three chief features: Event Management, Online Broadcast, and Content Marketing Tools.
 
ICTG Platform
 
On October 6, 2014, The Pulse Network acquired You Everywhere Now, LLC, VoiceFollowUp, LLC and Traffic Geyser, LLC (collectively, “ICTG”) which are collectively a marketing technology services business. ICTG is complete marketing and follow up automation software. Customers of ICTG set up a lead database and direct an “Instant Customer” on what to do. The instant customer will then automatically follow up with email, SMS/text, direct to voicemail, video, postcards and letters, and even simulated live webinars. Instant Customer does all the follow up automatically, offers a dashboard to monitor how well business is doing, what areas need focus, what areas are strong, and which methods are working most effectively to cut down unneeded marketing costs and increase profit margins.
 
Event Management
 
The Pulse Network's event management solution is a global, end-to-end tool for event groups all over the world. This solution allows event groups to store all data related to each individual tradeshow or conference they organize. The platform allows event groups to manage and house their lead database, communicate with customers, and perform registration services both online and onsite. Event groups can seamlessly execute events using the platform from the beginning stages through post-conference campaigns by leveraging the tools of the platform, bringing events to life year-round. This solution helps event groups increase verification rates, increase attendance, and improve attendee satisfaction.
 
Created by the team that developed the Exgenex (a company formerly operated by Nicholas Saber, Stephen Saber, and John Saber) registration system, The Pulse Network’s event management solution was built from the ground up. The single platform approach allows a client to run their entire suite of events, both domestic and international, produced in English or foreign languages in the same master database.
 
In addition, The Pulse Network’s capabilities include full event management support – including show production, a comprehensive speaker management system, with the ability to manage complete speaker processing through the system, from call for papers, to ranking proposals and managing sessions, and Continuing Education Unit (CEU) session tracking and reporting, with full scheduling / tracking of CEU credits, online access for attendees, and email updates. 
 
For lead management, The Pulse Network offers HostMyLeads.com, along with extensive event marketing and mobile capabilities, including lead retrieval, session surveys, product locator, exhibitor layout, and reporting. Since 1994, The Pulse Network team has been providing event technologies, registration and lead generation services to businesses, event organizers and associations of all sizes. Today these solutions include web services and lead management programs to help clients engage with their community across all channels – online, mobile or face to face.
 
The Pulse Network’s Event Database Solutions include a comprehensive multi-channel SaaS platform for marketing support, registration, housing, management reporting, lead retrieval, online production, event websites, and CEU tracking, along with services for marketing and event management used at events worldwide ranging in size from 50 to 200,000 participants.

Content Marketing Tools
 
The content marketing tools which support the cloud-based platform include a content curation tool, syndication and distribution tools, social sharing, newsletter creation, analytics and reporting, and prospect management among many others. These tools benefit corporate marketers by simplifying processes for sharing content related to products and service, communicating with consumers and implementing lead nurturing campaigns.
 
The Pulse Network’s content curation tool is a one-click option that allows anyone across the web to tag an article for use in a content marketing effort. With the loading of a simple plug-in on any browser, customers can allow anyone connected to the organization to click, categorize, and tag an article for use on a digital publication, in a newsletter, or for social sharing and engagement.
 
The Pulse Network’s newsletter creation tool creates a newsletter with 5 simple clicks. No longer does a marketer need to wait for a developer or HTML programmer to program an email newsletter for distribution. Simply choose the content from the content library (content that was curated or loaded into the platform) and in an instant a newsletter has been created and is ready for distribution.
 
Early Customer Engagement Platform
 
On June 9, 2014, the Pulse Network announced the release of its Cloud-Based Integrated Platform for Early Customer Engagement. The Pulse Network’s platform helps clients create a digital publication, original video centric content, curate content, and build a powerful content marketing program. No longer do clients have to outsource content marketing, The Pulse Network’s platform can now do it for them. They can create entire newsletters with just a few clicks, pulling content elements from multiple sources, delivering fresh content each week. With TPNI's new tool, delivering content has never been easier.
