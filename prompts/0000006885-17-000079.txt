ITEM 1.                                        BUSINESS
Our Business
Stage Stores, Inc. and its subsidiary (“we,” “us” or “our”) operate specialty department stores primarily in small and mid-sized towns and communities. We provide customers a welcoming and comfortable shopping experience in our stores and through our direct-to-consumer business.  Our merchandise assortment is a well-edited selection of moderately priced brand name and private label apparel, accessories, cosmetics, footwear and home goods. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 798 specialty department stores in 38 states under the BEALLS, GOODY’S, PALAIS ROYAL, PEEBLES and STAGE nameplates and a direct-to-consumer business. 
Our History
Stage Stores, Inc. was formed in 1988 when the management of Palais Royal, together with several venture capital firms, acquired the family-owned Bealls and Palais Royal chains, both of which were originally founded in the 1920s. At the time of the acquisition, Palais Royal operated primarily larger stores, located in and around the Houston metropolitan area, while Bealls operated primarily smaller stores, principally located in rural Texas towns. 
Our Market and Target Customer
Our distinct store environment and well-edited assortments offer name brand, trend-right apparel, accessories, cosmetics, footwear and home goods. While our broad assortments attract a wide demographic, our primary target customers are style and value savvy women over the age of 35 who are married, employed full time and have an average household income of $55,000. Our customer research reveals our target customer loves shopping and enjoys a shopping experience that brings her style, value and inspiration where she lives.
Competition
The retail industry is highly competitive, with competition coming from both brick-and-mortar stores as well as e-commerce. We view our ability to provide our customers the options of shopping both in store and online, particularly in underserved markets, as a competitive advantage. Additional competitive advantages over local retailers and small regional chains in the small to mid-sized communities include (i) economies of scale (ii) strong vendor relationships (iii) a widely used private label credit card and (iv) extensive experience in small and mid-size markets. In larger markets where we compete against other national department store chains, we distinguish ourselves by striving to offer a high level of customer service and the advantage of generally being in neighborhood locations with convenient parking and easy access.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and are key drivers of our success:
Unique Real Estate Positioning and Strong Store Economics. Our stores are predominantly located in small towns and communities with populations of less than 150,000 people. We predominantly lease our locations and are generally secondary users of space, allowing us to secure advantageous occupancy terms. Our average store of 18,000 square feet creates an opportunity to offer a selection that feels comprehensive and curated in an inviting environment.

Trend-Right, Brand Name Merchandise Delivered at a Compelling Value. Our stores and direct-to-consumer business carry a broad selection of trend-right, brand name apparel, accessories, cosmetics, footwear and home goods for the entire family. Our buyers identify and purchase nationally recognized, quality brands and trend-right styles our customers find compelling from respected brands such as Adidas, Calvin Klein, Carters, Chaps, Clinique, Dockers, Estee Lauder, Izod, Levi’s, Nautica, Nike, Nine West and Skechers. Our value proposition for moderately priced, brand name merchandise includes discount and promotional offers. We believe our use of discount and promotional offers generates customer excitement and drives loyalty and repeat shopping.
Experienced Management Team with a Disciplined Operating Philosophy. Our senior management team has extensive experience across a wide range of disciplines in the retail industry, including merchandising, marketing, store operations, human resources, information systems and finance. Our management team has built a solid operating foundation based on sound retail principles and is focused on taking care of our customers and providing great merchandise and a great experience.
Stores
Store Openings and Closures. We did not open any new stores during 2016 and do not plan to open new stores in 2017. As part of a strategic evaluation of our store portfolio in 2015, we announced a multi-year plan to close stores that we believe do not have the potential to meet our sales productivity and profitability standards. Since then, we have closed 60 stores, including 37 stores during 2016. We expect to close approximately 100 stores in total through 2019, with 15 to 20 store closures anticipated for 2017. We continually review the profitability of each store and will consider closing a store if the expected store performance does not meet our financial hurdle rates. The closure of these stores is expected to improve our ability to effectively allocate capital, deliver higher sales productivity and be accretive to earnings.
Expansion, Relocation and Remodeling. During 2016, we completed 86 store remodels, relocations and expansions. Since we began our store remodel initiative in 2015, we have updated over 200 stores representing approximately 45% of our sales base. We believe that our investment in these stores improves the store environment and helps us create an inviting and differentiated shopping experience. Our store remodels are designed to create a bright, fun and comfortable environment and include upgrades ranging from improved lighting, flooring, paint, fixtures, fitting rooms, visual merchandising and signage, to more extensive expansion projects.

Utilizing a ten-mile radius from each store, approximately 65% of our stores are located in communities with populations below 50,000 people, while an additional 19% of our stores are located in communities with populations between 50,000 and 150,000 people. The remaining 16% of our stores are located in higher-density markets with populations greater than 150,000 people, such as Houston, San Antonio and Lubbock, Texas. The store count and selling square footage by market area population are as follows:

 | Number of Stores | Selling Square Footage (in thousands)

Direct-to-Consumer
In our ongoing effort to enhance the customer experience, we are focused on providing customers with a seamless experience across our channels. Our direct-to-consumer business, which consists of our e-commerce website and Send program, enables us to reach customers with additional convenience and assortment of merchandise, acquire customers beyond our local markets, and further build our brand. Our e-commerce website, which we launched in 2010, features a broader assortment of the merchandise categories found in our stores, as well as additional product offerings. Our in-store Send program allows customers to have merchandise shipped directly to their homes if the preferred size or color is not available in their local store. 
As our omni-channel strategy continues to mature, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between store sales and direct-to-consumer sales. Below are few examples of how our stores and direct-to-consumer business intersect: 

• | Stores increase online sales by providing customers opportunities to view, touch and/or try on physical merchandise before ordering online.


• | Many customers preview our merchandise online before making a purchase in our stores.


• | Most online purchases can easily be returned in our stores.


• | In 2016, we introduced buy online, ship to store, which gives our customers the option to have online purchases shipped for free to a local store.


• | Style Circle Rewards® can be redeemed online or in stores regardless of where they are earned.


• | Customers may apply coupons from our website or mobile app to their purchase when they check out in the store.


• | Online orders may be shipped from one of our distribution centers, a store, a direct ship vendor or any combination of the above.

Providing our customers the opportunity to engage with us through multiple channels is part of a cohesive business strategy that helps us build our brand loyalty. Customers that shop with us both online and in stores spend, on average, 3 times more than customers that shop only in our stores.

Merchandising
We offer a well-edited selection of moderately priced, branded merchandise within distinct merchandise categories of women’s, men’s and children’s apparel, accessories, cosmetics, footwear and home goods. Our direct-to-consumer business allows us to extend the breadth of our assortments and offer additional products.
The following table sets forth the distribution of net sales among our various merchandise categories:


 | Fiscal Year
Merchandise Category | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Women’s | 37 | % | | 38 | % | 38 | %
Men’s | 17 | | | 17 | | 17 | 
Children's | 12 | | | 11 | | 11 | 
Footwear | 13 | | | 13 | | 13 | 
Accessories | 7 | | | 7 | | 8 | 
Cosmetics/Fragrances | 10 | | | 10 | | 9 | 
Home/Gifts/Other | 4 | | | 4 | | 4 | 
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %


Merchandise selections reflect current styles and trends and merchandise mix may also vary from store to store to accommodate differing demographic, regional and climate characteristics. Our buying and planning team uses technology tools such as size pack optimization and store level markdown optimization. These tools allow us to better fulfill customer needs by tailoring size assortments by store and by being more targeted in how we markdown merchandise by climate and store. 
Approximately 82% of sales consist of nationally recognized brands such as Adidas, Calvin Klein, Carters, Chaps, Clinique, Dockers, Estee Lauder, G by Guess, Izod, Jessica Simpson, Levi’s, Nike, Nine West and Skechers, while the remaining 18% of sales are private label merchandise. 
Our private label portfolio brands are developed and sourced through agreements with third party vendors. We believe our private label and exclusive brands offer a compelling mix of style, quality and value. We continue to refine the positioning of our private brands and we see them as an avenue for growth.
Merchandise Distribution
 We currently distribute all merchandise to our stores through distribution centers located in Jacksonville, Texas, South Hill, Virginia and Jeffersonville, Ohio. Incoming merchandise received at the distribution centers is inspected for quality control purposes. 
Integrated merchandising and warehouse management systems support all corporate and distribution center locations. All of our distribution centers are equipped with modern sortation equipment which enables us to meet specific store merchandise assortment needs. The majority of stores receive merchandise within three days of shipment from the distribution centers. We utilize third party contract carriers to deliver merchandise from the distribution centers to our stores.
Direct-to-consumer orders are predominantly filled from our distribution center in Jacksonville, Texas and to a lesser extent from our Jeffersonville, Ohio distribution center, select stores and directly from our vendors.

Marketing 
Our marketing strategy is designed to establish and reward brand loyalty. The strategy supports each store’s position as the destination for desirable styles and nationally recognized brands at an attractive value in a comfortable and welcoming environment. Our marketing strategy leverages (i) consumer insight from brand and customer research, (ii) identified customer purchase history and (iii) emerging technology and trends in retail marketing. 
We use a multi-media advertising approach, including broadcast media, digital media, mobile media, local newspaper inserts and direct mail. In addition, we leverage our private label credit card to create strong customer loyalty through compelling offers, dedicated events for cardholders, and updates on the latest deliveries in our stores.
We consider our private label credit card program and Style Circle Rewards®, our tender-neutral loyalty program, to be vital components of our business because these loyalty programs (i) enhance customer loyalty, (ii) allow us to identify and regularly contact our best customers and (iii) create a comprehensive database that enables us to implement targeted and personalized marketing messages. Private label credit card purchases represented 47%, 44% and 40% of our sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In the third quarter of 2016, we launched Style Circle Rewards® to encourage and reward customer loyalty for both private label credit cardholders and non-cardholders. These loyalty programs allow us to better understand and respond to our customers’ shopping habits and are powerful tools to drive higher transaction value and frequency of visits.
Brand image is an important part of our marketing program. Our principal trademarks, including the BEALLS, GOODY’S, PALAIS ROYAL, PEEBLES and STAGE trademarks, have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We have also registered trademarks used in connection with our private label merchandise. We regard our trademarks and their protection as important to our success.

We maintain a connection to the communities we serve and operate a locally based giving campaign called 30 Days of Giving under our Community Counts program. In 2016, through our Community Counts program and other efforts like our Bears that Care program, we helped raise approximately $2.1 million for the communities we serve.
Customer Service

We strive to provide exceptional customer service through conveniently located stores staffed with well-trained and motivated sales associates. In order to ensure consistency of execution, each sales associate is evaluated based on the attainment of specific customer service standards, such as offering a friendly greeting, providing prompt assistance, helping open private label credit card accounts, thanking customers and inviting return visits. We also conduct customer satisfaction surveys to measure and monitor attainment of customer service expectations. The results of customer surveys are used to provide feedback to reinforce and improve customer service. To further reinforce our focus on customer service, we have various programs in place to recognize our sales associates for providing outstanding customer service.

Information Systems
We support our business by using multiple, highly integrated systems in areas such as merchandising, store operations, distribution, sales promotion, personnel management, store design and accounting. Our core merchandising systems assist in planning, ordering, allocating and replenishing merchandise assortments for each store, based on specific characteristics and recent sales trends. Our replenishment/fulfillment system allows us to maintain planned levels of in-stock positions in basic items such as jeans and underwear. In addition, a fully integrated warehouse management system is in place in all three distribution centers.
We have a store level markdown optimization tool, which is focused on pricing items on a style-by-style basis at the appropriate price, based on inventory levels and sales history to maximize revenue and profitability. Our assortment planning system allows us to create customer-centric assortments aligned to sales strategies. The system also facilitates cleaner seasonal transitions and fresher merchandise in stores. We continue to expand the utilization and effectiveness of our merchandise planning system in order to maximize the generation of sales and gross margin. In 2016, we implemented new systems to support our Style Circle Rewards® loyalty program and omni-channel order management, and we introduced buy online, ship to store.
We utilize a point-of-sale (“POS”) platform with bar code scanning, electronic credit authorization, instant credit, a returns database and gift card processing in all our stores. The POS platform allows us to capture customer specific sales data for use in our merchandising, marketing and loss prevention systems, while servicing our customers. The POS platform also manages coupon and deal-based pricing, which streamlines the checkout process and improves store associate adherence to promotional markdown policies. 
Our Employees
At January 28, 2017, we employed approximately 12,400 hourly and salaried employees. Employee levels vary during the year as we traditionally hire additional sales associates and increase the hours of part-time sales associates during peak seasonal selling periods. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good, and there are no collective bargaining agreements in effect with respect to any of our employees. 
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal and sales are traditionally lower during the first three quarters of the fiscal year (February through October) and higher during the last quarter of the fiscal year (November through January). The fourth quarter usually accounts for approximately 32% of our annual sales, with each of the other quarters accounting for approximately 22% to 24%. Working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as well and generally reach their highest levels during the third and fourth quarters.
